The conflict between Russia and Ukraine in early 2022 led to a surge of natural 
gas and crude oil prices. The tightening of supplies led to a so-called “Fourth Energy 
Crisis” and has transformed the global energy trade entirely, forcing countries 
worldwide to shift gears in the energy transition. The global economy is clouded by 
surging inflation, geopolitical tensions, and an everlasting pandemic as the war in 
Ukraine drags on. Under such difficult circumstances, CPC strives to maintain a stable 
oil and gas supply within the country and follow the Taiwanese Government’s price-
freezing policies to stabilize commodity prices for households and industrial users. 
CPC has thus cumulatively absorbed nearly a NT$300 billion deficit; such an endeavor 
has led to enormous, record-high financial losses.
Even so, thanks to the dedication and efforts of all CPC employees, the company 
has made significant progress in all business areas in 2022, and it continues to build 
on previous success in environmental sustainability, social inclusion and corporate 
governance (ESG). 
Regarding energy prospecting, CPC actively seeks international collaboration. 
The first oil well at Guardfish in the US was put into production in June; Nos. 16, 
17, and 18 geothermal exploration wells at the Yilan site were completed with 
active development of domestic geothermal energy, and green energy MOUs with 
Taiwan Cement Corp. and Baseload Power Taiwan were signed respectively, for the 
cooperative development of geothermal energies in Hualien and Taitung. 
Regarding carbon neutrality, in 2022, CPC built the first carbon-neutral gas 
station in Taiwan – the Qianfeng Road station. It is also the first carbon-neutral gas 
station worldwide that adheres to the PAS 2060 standard and was third-party verified 
with the BSI, generating local carbon credits and offsetting carbon locally. CPC also 
imported the first shipment of crude oil with a certified carbon offset. With CPC’s efforts 
in recent years, including voluntary emission reduction and environmental actions, the 
company has made great strides in four areas pursuing carbon neutrality: natural gas, 
ethylene, gas stations, and crude oil. 
Regarding energy infrastructure, CPC continues to push forward major 
infrastructure plans following the government’s energy transformation policies, including 
eight stabilizing natural gas supply projects and five refinery transition investment 
projects. In particular, Taichung LNG Terminal Phase III Investment Project began the 
construction of storage tanks and regasification facility in 2022. Once complete, the 
overall natural gas storage and distribution resilience will be further improved. 
Regarding diversified energy services, in 2022, CPC gas stations won the 
Reader’s Digest  Trusted Brand Platinum Award for the 22nd consecutive year, which 
shows that the general public widely recognizes the company’s service quality. CPC 
also continued its installation of smart and green gas stations, having completed an 
eight-plug charging facility at the Guangming Road station in Hsinchu and 226 battery 
charging/ swapping facilities for electric scooters, which met CPC’s target of installing 
a thousand public charging stations in total."
"Regarding environmental protection and conservation, in 2022, CPC conserved 
the energy equivalent of 36,000 cubic meters of oil and reduced emissions to the 
equivalent to 76,000 tons of carbon dioxide. CPC also completed carbon footprint 
verification for petrochemical products, which is also third-party certified. CPC has 
fulfilled its commitment to ensure that the natural environment and the Guantang LNG 
Terminal can prosper together. It held a presentation on November 7, showcasing the 
conservation result of Guantang’s ecosystem, a culmination of four years’ work. 
In 2022, CPC announced the launch of CPC Net Zero Year One, pursuing ESG 
excellence with three transition strategies: optimizing refining operations, reducing 
carbon emissions, and developing clean energy. CPC’s endeavor received wide 
recognition in Taiwan and overseas, winning ESG and sustainable development 
accolades. In particular, CPC’s aim to accelerate the transition to Net Zero won the 
Taiwan Sustainability Action Awards (TSAA) gold award. The company also received 
yet another Sustainability and Resilience Pilot Award from BSI. CPC is not only 
standing out among state-owned enterprises but acts as a leader of companies in 
Taiwan.ChairmanIncorporating  Net Zero into ESG Goals
3
PresidentRegarding environmental sustainability, CPC is implementing sustainable practices 
following the Net Zero strategy. Regarding the optimization of refining operations, 
CPC has adopted a progressive Crude Oil-to-Chemicals (COTC) strategy which has 
not only increased the conversion rate year-on-year, but has also created other value-
added petrochemical materials. In 2022, CPC collaborated with the National Space 
Organization (NSPO) to successfully develop a product-optical payload composite 
cylinder and continued on the research plans for advanced materials, such as 
Dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and lithium-titanium-oxide (LTO).
Regarding carbon reduction, in 2022, CPC set a mid-term target of reducing 
49.5% of emissions (compared with the base year 2005) by 2030. To meet the target, 
CPC is focusing on improving energy efficiency, reducing emissions in production 
processes, conducting carbon footprint verification for CPC products, and adopting 
an internal carbon pricing scheme. The company is also actively involved in Carbon 
Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) projects, such as the CCU demonstration 
system in the Dalin Refinery and the CCS pilot program at Tieh-Chen Mountain. 
In the pursuit of clean energy, CPC has expanded into renewables, including 
hydrogen, geothermal, and solar power, and it has planned the installation of the first 
hydrogen refueling demonstration station as its first venture into the realm of hydrogen 
energy. CPC plans to build a new 4MW geothermal power plant in Tuchang of Yilan 
and continues to install more solar power plants so that the overall installation capacity 
for solar energy would reach as high as 24.48MW. 
To promote social inclusion, CPC employs Slow-Flying Angels (people with 
developmental delays) in its kindness gas stations and strives to build a friendly, 
inclusive workplace. In 2022, CPC won the first prize in the Global Views Magazine’s 
CSR Awards and Asia Responsible Enterprise Awards (AREA) by Enterprise Asia. The 
year marked the tenth anniversary of CPC’s charity campaign to encourage the general 
public to donate blood. CPC also continues its plan to maintain environment-friendly 
public toilets. In 2022, public toilets in all CPC-owned stations were rated as Excellent. 
On November 19, World Toilet Day, CPC invited franchise stations to contribute to 
the cause, cleaning public toilets and achieving Urban Sanitation, the United Nations’ 
Sustainable Development Goal 16. 
Regarding corporate governance, CPC believes that integrity and safety are 
the prerequisites for a company to thrive. The fire at the R3 Refinery in 2022 dealt a 
massive blow to CPC’s corporate image. Consequently, the company reviewed all 
existing procedures, made adjustments, and established the first procurement integrity 
platform for major construction projects, and the company is determined to uphold 
transparency and eliminate criminal incidents. CPC strives to maintain compliance, 
integrity, and professionalism. In light of the 2022 fire, CPC was prompted to conduct 
a comprehensive review of equipment (including standards and regulations), operation, 
and management, to ensure that such accidents would never occur again. As a part of 
National Critical Infrastructure (CI), in 2022, CPC incorporated advanced technologies 
such as 5G internet and AIoT into environmental safety, pipelines, storage tanks, critical 
equipment, operation management, and training, to enhance resilience and ensure 
security. 
As the war in Ukraine drags on and inflation continues to surge, the outlook 
for the coming year remains challenging. Energy demand will depend on the status"
"of the global economy; meanwhile, energy prices are affected by geopolitics and 
other factors, and remain uncertain. While enhancing integrity, occupational safety, 
environmental protection, and cybersecurity, CPC will continue to monitor the dynamics 
of the energy market to ensure a stable domestic supply. Also, CPC will improve 
coordination and flexibility of production, marketing, distribution, and storage to provide 
a steady energy supply, and to ensure energy security in the country. As the world 
shifts towards Net Zero, CPC will uphold its three transition strategies – optimizing 
refining operations, reducing carbon emissions, and developing clean energy – while 
investing in research and development to gain momentum moving forward. CPC plans 
to make tangible progress in energy saving, emission reduction, renewables, and 
energy storage. Meanwhile, CPC also aims to explore new businesses on the road to 
transition, enhancing the company’s resilience towards environmental changes. It is the 
consensus of everyone at CPC to transform such a vision into reality and move toward 
sustainability.
Sustainable Development 4
CPC’s Timeline 
of Innovative 
Development
CPC was established in Shanghai on June 1, 
1946, initially under the aegis of the Council 
of Resources – the precursor of today’s 
State-owned Enterprise Commission, 
Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In 2003 CPC instituted a policy for 
sustainable development, in line with 
both the global trend and the need for 
environmental protection.
On June 17, 2016, the board of directors 
approved revising the company’s articles 
of association and moved its headquarters 
from Taipei City to Kaohsiung City.1946
2003
On February 9, 2007, the board of directors 
approved changing the company’s English 
name from “Chinese Petroleum Corporation” 
to “CPC Corporation, Taiwan.”2007
2016Following the ROC government’s relocation to 
Taiwan in 1949, the corporate headquarters 
was set up in Taipei, and the company’s 
affiliation was transferred to the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs. Its business scope and 
facilities are carried out throughout Taiwan, 
encompassing importing, procurement, 
exploration, production, refining, storage and 
distribution of oil and gas. In addition, CPC 
produces petrochemical raw materials.1949Sustainable 
Practice that 
Constantly 
Creates Value5
CPC Corporation Taiwan established the Sustainable Operation Promotion Committee in 2005, a core 
driver for sustainable operation. The CPC chairman serves as the committee chair; the president serves 
as the vice chair, while the vice president in charge of business management serves as the executive 
secretary. Other executives, external experts, and scholars serve as committee members. Together, the 
committee reviews the sustainability issues affecting business operations and stakeholder interest.
The committee aims to achieve sustainable operation with tangible actions, constantly creating value 
for stakeholders; therefore, the committee categorized issues concerning sustainable operation into four 
parts: environmental and ecological conservation, social, social care, policies, and R&D, and environmental 
accounting & information. Execution groups for each category were created, formulating action plans 
and monitoring progress. Members of the execution groups come from various departments 
within the company, which makes resource integration and strategy and action plan 
implementation more effective.
In 2022, CPC Sustainable Operation Promotion Committee convened three 
meetings and voted on several sustainability proposals. The CPC president 
intermittently reports to the Board of Directors on the progress and effectiveness 
of the sustainable operation endeavors.CPC’s Sustainable Operation Policy and Practice

Upstream Operations
Exploration and Production
Taiwan has limited indigenous energy resources; therefore, it depends on 
imports for most of its fossil fuel needs. As a result, CPC has cooperated with the 
government’s “furthering energy supply security mechanism and forging international 
energy cooperation” policy. CPC is dedicated to improving its performance in new"
"energy development, expanding upstream operations, and increasing overseas 
production, to stabilize the supply of crude oil and natural gas to the domestic market 
and alleviate the impact of oil price fluctuation.
To improve overall strategic planning, and based on active expansion and 
focus, CPC has adopted exploration and production strategies that aim to expand 
overseas operations and exploit domestic operations, simultaneously undertaking 
mergers and acquisitions and exploration and production, as well as the training of 
talent for breakthroughs, in the hope of gradually increasing the ratio of self-owned 
energy reserves within its full sourcing range, moving towards developing low-carbon 
energy resources.
Planning geothermal power plants per government policy
Currently, the CPC’s onshore producing oil and gas wells are located in and 
around Mt. Tiezhen, Jinshui, Ching Tsaohu, and Guantian. In 2022, they yielded 95.8 
million cubic meters of natural gas and 1,868 kiloliters of condensate.Striving for Low-carbon and 
Renewable Energy11
In 2022, following the government’s National Renewable Energy Policy, CPC 
completed a geothermal survey of Hungyie-Ruisui in Hualien County, which covered 
72 square kilometers, and a geochemistry study of the area. Also, CPC signed an MOU 
with Baseload Power, a company developing geothermal power in the same area, to 
join forces in prospecting and exploration. CPC had already completed the production 
test of geothermal wells No. 14 and 15 in Tuchang, Yilan, whose geothermal power 
potential is 1.2MW (a conservative estimate). Building on such foundation, in 2022, 
CPC completed the drilling and prospecting for well Nos. 16, 17, and 18 in Tuchang, 
and began planning the CPC-owned 4MW geothermal power plant. In 2023, the 
company will expand the scope of exploration for two more geothermal wells in 
Tuchang and prepare for future power generation.
Offshore E&P and CCS
Starting on December 18, 2012, CPC worked with Husky Energy International 
Corporation to explore the oil and gas potential in the deep-water areas of the Tainan 
basin. The acquisition, processing, and interpretation of 2D and 3D seismic survey 
data was completed in 2021. CPC and Husky Energy also completed a joint study with 
risk assessment basin modeling in 2022 and expect to proceed with preliminary well 
design in 2023.
Regarding prospecting and exploration in domestic waters, CPC has targeted 
the Tainan basin, using new technologies to re-process and interpret seismic data 
and conduct oil and gas potential studies. Additionally, following the government's 
Net Zero emission policy, CPC is assessing potential sites for carbon sequestration 
at several basins offshore of west Taiwan. With CPC’s vast underwater geological 
data and exploration experience, the company is formulating short-, mid-, and long-
term plans for offshore carbon dioxide sequestration. In the future, there is potential 
for establishing a large-scale commercial offshore site that not only meets CPC’s 
sequestration needs but also offers a new path for companies in Taiwan to reduce 
emissions.

International collaboration: two new oil and gas concessions
In 2022, CPC was engaged in oil and gas exploration and production joint 
ventures with international oil companies, participating in ten projects in eight 
countries. Annual production, including 5.68 million barrels of crude oil, 441 million 
cubic meters of natural gas and 59.2 thousand barrels of LPG, were allocated to CPC. 
The oil and gas were from fields in United States of America, Ecuador, Niger, Australia 
and Chad.
Significant milestones include: Large-scale extraction at the Niger oil fields, 
aiming for crude oil export soon; the Ichthys Project in Australia, which has continued 
with the Phase 2 development plan and maintains stable production with good 
profitability; the Prelude Project in Australia continued its sound LNG production, 
serving Taiwan's domestic market; the Oryx Field in Chad has consistently maintained 
a stable oil production level; the Guardfish Project in the U.S. was put into production 
in June; and the Service Contract of the Block 16 in Ecuador expired on December 
31, and relevant facilities were returned to the local government. 
Besides the development and production projects stated above, CPC continues 
to seek exploration and prospecting opportunities for oil and gas. In 2022, CPC 
completed the contract signing for two new concessions, awaiting approval of local 
governments.
CPC’s upstream business was launched in 1959. Today, it comprises exploration 
and production in both onshore and offshore oil and gas fields, both in Taiwan and 
overseas. To date, CPC has yielded over NTD$ 200 billion in upstream business."
"Looking to the future, CPC will actively enhance the value of existing assets. Merger 
and acquisition (M&A) activities will focus on exploration blocks with low risk and 
assets with potential to increase self-owned reserves. CPC also ventures into 
renewable energy, developing geothermal power while preparing for carbon capture 
and storage (CCS). The goal is to become an international oil and gas company with 
high value-added assets.2022 CPC’s overseas

Downstream Operations
Importing & Refining
As Taiwan’s domestic production of crude oil yields only extremely low volumes, CPC needs to import 
virtually all of the crude it refines to supply its domestic market. To ensure stability, CPC works to both 
maximize procurement on long-term contracts and diversify its sources of crude.
Crude oil imports reached 138.69 million barrels in 2022: 45.31% from the Middle East, 43.72% from 
the USA, and 9.06% from Africa. In recent years, low-sulfur crude oil makes up some crude oil imports to 
meet the more stringent environmental laws.
To import crude oil, CPC has installed offshore mooring pontoons to unload large oil tankers at Shalun 
in Taoyuan and at Dalinpu in Kaohsiung. The company has also built dedicated loading/unloading berths 
for tankers in the ports of Kaohsiung, Taichung and ShenAo.
Improving quality and offering better products
Currently, CPC’s operating refineries in Taoyuan and Dalin can refine 600,000 barrels of crude oil per 
day. In particular, the Dalin Refinery has four offshore mooring pontoons and ports with which to unload 
imported crude oil and export oil products. It has a refining capacity is 400,000 barrels per day, while the 
Taoyuan Refinery’s capacity is 200,000 barrels per day. In 2022, CPC’s refined product output totaled 9.309 
million kiloliters of gasoline, 2.217 million kiloliters of aviation fuel, 5.964 million kiloliters of diesel, 1.899 
million kiloliters of fuel oil, and 367 kilotonnes of LPG.
Fulfilling the government’s commitment to relocate industrial facilities, the Kaohsiung Refinery ceased 
production in late 2015, with its crude oil refining activities were transferred to the Dalin Refinery, which 
was expanded to meet domestic demand. Petrochemical materials supply was made up by the New-No.3 
Naphtha Cracker in Linyuan and by imports.
Given the public’s concern for the quality of life, Taiwan’s standards of environmental protection are 
increasingly stringent. At the same time, the demand for oil-derived products is growing more diverse. 
The company has gradually built additional refining facilities, such as reforming units, isomerization units, 
gasoline/diesel desulfurization plants, and an aviation fuel processing facility, together with normal paraffin, 
alkylation, and residual fluid catalytic cracking (RFCC) units. CPC also plans to build VDU, SDA units, and 
aromatic hydrocarbon extraction units to improve production and to offer domestic consumers even better 
products.Bearing the Responsibility of

Optimizing refining procedures to meet emission standards
The Environment Protection Administration, (EPA) called for reductions in the sulfur 
content of gasoline and diesel fuel to under 10ppmw, of the aromatic hydrocarbon content 
of gasoline and diesel fuel to under 35 vol%, and of the olefin content of gasoline to under 
18 vol%, by 2011. By 2008, CPC had constructed a 30,000 barrels per day pyrolysis 
gasoline hydro-desulfurization unit at the Taoyuan Refinery, a 20,000 barrels per day 
pyrolysis gasoline hydrodesulfurization unit at the Dalin Refinery by 2009; and a 40,000 
barrels per day diesel hydro-desulfurization unit at the Dalin Refinery by 2010. Furthermore,"
"a pyrolysis gasoline production unit with 18,000-barrel-per-day output was moved from the 
Kaohsiung Refinery to the Dalin Refinery in 2011.
CPC began increasing its heavy oil conversion rate by constructing an RFCC unit with 
a capacity of 80,000 barrels per day at the Dalin Refinery. CPC also completed its testing 
and began volume production in 2013. CPC completed testing of the alkylation plant with a 
capacity of 14,000 barrels per day and began volume production in mid-2013; its operation 
has increased the value of our product and improved gasoline quality. In addition, to cope 
with the problem of acidic gas generated in the production process and to reduce polluting 
emissions, CPC has invested in the construction of a sulfur plant with a daily output of 250 
tons, which started to produce qualified sulfur products at the end of June 2014.
The No.3 Residual Oil Hydro-desulfurization Unit at the Dalin Refinery was also 
expanded to increase its high sulfur crude refining capacity, lowering the cost of crude oil 
procurement and stabilizing the quality of the RFCC unit's feedstock. The revamped unit 
began operation in March 2017, increasing production to 40,000 barrels daily.
To cope with the consequences of the Kaohsiung Refinery closure, the Dalin 
Refinery expanded its capacity to include a 150,000 barrels per day atmospheric crude 
oil distillation unit (CDU), a 50,000 barrels per day condensate fractionating unit (CFU), 
a 40,000 barrels per day diesel hydro-desulfurization (DHDS); unit and a 30,000 barrels 
per day kerosene hydro-desulfurization (KHDS) unit. These units completed performance 
testing and began mass production in 2018, eliminating concerns of raw materials 
shortages (due to the closure of the Kaohsiung Refinery) needed for the survival and future 
development of Taiwan’s petrochemical industry. With the completion of that expansion 
project, the capacity of the Dalin Refinery was boosted from 300,000 barrels per day to 
400,000 barrels per day at present, raising CPC’s overall daily crude oil refining capacity to 
600,000 barrels per day.

To improve the refining configuration of the Dalin Refinery, meet the IMO 2020 
standard’s requirements for marine fuel oil, cater to the increasingly strict environmental 
regulations for air pollutant emissions in Taiwan, and strengthen its competitiveness in 
the asphalt market, CPC plans to construct a vacuum distillation unit (VDU) and a solvent 
deasphalting (SDA) unit at Dalin Refinery, along with Polymer-Modified Asphalt and asphalt 
cutback production facilities, asphalt storage facilities, an asphalt blending system, and a 
revamping of the No.9 diesel hydrodesulfurization unit and associated equipment. CPC aims 
to increase its competitiveness domestically and overseas through these efforts.
Reduction of benzene in gasoline to improve product quality
With the awareness of the need for environmental protection and concerns over air 
pollution, the EPA has enforced stricter standards for automobile gasoline. Since July 1, 
2020, benzene levels in petroleum have gradually been reduced from 1.0 vol% to 0.9 vol%. 
The EPA plans to reduce benzene to less than 0.8 vol% in the future. In response to energy 
transition and the regulatory limits for the benzene content of gasoline, CPC first invested 
in the project to create a 0.3 wt. % ultralow sulfur fuel oil and asphalt cutback production 
center. In 2020, CPC proposed an investment plan for gasoline production for high-quality 
products with reduced benzene content. The company will build a unit to extract aromatics 
content from pyrolysis gasoline with a capacity of 32,000 barrels per day (including an 
aromatization unit) and its accessory equipment, including storage tanks and utility systems, 
to make its gasoline products comply with regulatory requirements and to increase the 
competitiveness of CPC and its products in both domestic and overseas markets.
Investing in CCS and planning demonstration sites
Since COP26, achieving net zero emissions by 2050 has become a global commitment, 
and the Taiwanese government also published “Taiwan’s Pathway to Net-Zero Emissions in 
2050” in 2021. Following this framework, CPC formulated the three strategies – optimizing 
refining operations, reducing carbon emissions, and developing clean energy. It has 
taken the initiative to research carbon capture (CC) and survey potential sites for carbon 
sequestration (CS) since 2021. The company plans to build a demonstration plant for carbon 
capture at the Dalin Refinery to further its contribution to sustainability.17
CPC in Petrochemicals
CPC’s major petrochemical production facilities are its Linyuan Petrochemical Plant, run by the 
Petrochemical Business Division, and the Taoyuan and Dalin refineries. operating under its Refining Business 
Division. The RFCC units in the two refineries at Dalin and Taoyuan produce propylene products, while the"
"naphtha crackers and butadiene extraction units at the Linyuan Petrochemical Plant produce ethylene, 
propylene, and butadiene products. Aromatics extraction units produce benzene, toluene, and mixed xylene. 
Currently, CPC’s annual production capacities for basic petrochemical raw materials are 1.07 million metric tons 
of ethylene, 1.194 million tons of propylene, 158 thousand metric tons (KTA) of butadiene, 274 KTA of benzene, 
321 KTA of toluene and 507 KTA of mixed xylene.
As a pioneer of the upstream petrochemical business in Taiwan, CPC has continued to invest in various 
upstream petrochemical businesses to drive the development of the domestic petrochemical industry, which has 
contributed to the economic miracle of Taiwan. In recent years, it has been dedicated to equipment upgrades 
and capacity expansion to reduce the petrochemical raw materials supply shortage. In 2005, CPC implemented 
the “New No. 3 Naphtha Cracker” project at the Linyuan Petrochemical Plant, with an investment of over NT$40 
billion. This new No. 3 Naphtha Cracker started to produce ethylene that meets specific standards in 2013 with 
an ethylene capacity of 720 KTA, propylene capacity of 370 KTA, and butadiene capacity of 100 KTA. It supplies 
petrochemical raw materials to both downstream businesses in Linyuan Industrial Park and Renda Industrial 
Park, whose supply was initially provided by the No.5 Naphtha Cracker, creating economic benefits worth 
around NT$100 billion annually. CPC plans to evaluate the expansion of petrochemical production capacity 
based on market demand to fully supply basic raw materials for not only daily commodities but also high-tech 
industries.
Refining-petrochemicals integration with low-carbon transformation
In response to the growth of the global electric vehicles market and in support of the government’s energy 
transition policy, CPC has conducted the integration of its refining and petrochemical businesses, reduced 
its production of gasoline and diesel, and has produced more chemicals. In addition, CPC has reduced the 
severity of pollution from its plants, decreased the energy consumption of its operations. It has strengthened 
safety at its facilities through the supply of raw materials among different business units, and its plan to create 
a synergy of its resources and public facilities through high-degree integration. In addition, CPC is evaluating 
the implementation of carbon capture, utilization, and storage technology (CCUS) to establish a low-carbon 
operation.
Strategy for optimizing refining operation and converting fuel into new materials
CPC actively complies with the government’s Circular Economy Policy by transforming petrochemical by-
products used as fuel or previously regarded industrial waste into value-added products. For example, CPC 
uses the heavy oil from naphtha crackers to produce soft-carbon material for lithium battery manufacturing, and 
purifies Dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) from pyrolysis gasoline to be used in wind turbine blades. Meanwhile, CPC 
will continue to assess carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies and develop value-added products.
Facing the energy transition challenge, CPC remains steadfast in sustainable operation, striving for success 
for Taiwan’s energy, economy and environment.18

Marketing CPC Petroleum Products
CPC’s marketing of refined petroleum products in its domestic market primarily focuses on the 
transportation sector—specifically gasoline, diesel, fuel oil, and aviation fuel. In 2022, its sales of those products 
in Taiwan totaled 16.59 million kiloliters in volume and generated approximately NT$ 421.8 billion in revenue. 
Automotive gasoline accounted for the largest share at around 50.1%, followed by diesel at about 26.8%, fuel oil 
at about 14.3%, and aviation fuel at approximately 8.8%.
Taiwan’s internal market for refined petroleum products is divided chiefly between CPC and the Formosa 
Plastics Group, and competition has grown increasingly intense. CPC has worked hard at leveraging the 
advantage of its marketing network and protecting its market share by consolidating its gas station network. Of 
the 2,519 stations operating in Taiwan at the end of 2022, CPC and other parties directly ran 623, and 1,302 
were privately owned by CPC franchisees, adding up to 1,925. Their sales as a part of the total market volume 
break down as 79.6% gasoline, 77.2% diesel, 96.4% fuel oil, and 60.3% aviation fuel, with the overall market 
share being 77.5%.
Storage and transportation network meets the requirements of all areas
In terms of storage and transportation, CPC not only runs its own gas stations, but also operates aviation 
fueling stations at all of Taiwan’s airports: Songshan, Taoyuan, Kaohsiung, Taichung, Hualien, Taitung, Kinmen, 
and Penghu. Around the coast, it has marine bunkering stations for international vessels at Keelung, Suao, 
Taichung, Kaohsiung, and Hualien ports."
"As of the end of 2022, CPC operated 13 product distribution centers located country-wide at Keelung, 
Shimen, Taichung, Taichung Harbor, Wangtian, Minxiong, Tainan, Fengde, Qiaotou, Suao, Hualien, Huxi, 
Kinmen and Matsu. They supplied products to gas stations in their surrounding areas with a total of 18,732,000 
kiloliters of products over the year. CPC has three chemical analysis centers/petroleum laboratories in Keelung, 
Taichung, and Kaohsiung, plus six testing laboratories, which test products for quality control, and altogether 
these handled 31,288 samples in 2022. The transportation department transported 11,825,000 kiloliters of oil in 
2022; the total distance covered was 40,642,000 kilometers.

Optimizing services with diverse and mobile payment
In terms of gas station operation, CPC is unquestionably the market leader by virtue of 
offering the consumers superior-quality services across the board that differentiate CPC from its 
competitors. The company has leveraged its service advantage by implementing total customer 
experience management which has created and maintained a culture of hygiene of lavatories, 
vigorously promoted VIP membership cards, introduced new business lines and services in line 
with contemporary trends, and reinforced customer relationship management. CPC has taken 
the lead in offering card-based self-service refueling as a means of lowering operating costs and 
working around the difficulty of recruiting filling station attendants. At the same time, as promoting 
a multi-service business model featuring a diversity of offerings, the company has boosted non-
operating income by strengthening cross-industry alliances.
Because of the popularity of mobile payments, CPC introduced and promoted contactless 
payment (Near-field Communications, NFC) in June 2018. To optimize the mobile payment 
program, CPC’s own payment tool, CPC Pay, was released on November 12, 2019. It can be 
considered a pioneer of an app exclusively designed for making mobile payments at gas stations. 
CPC Pay combines diverse functions, such as payment, member services, special offers, and 
vehicle-related services. Users can access a variety of information efficiently using CPC Pay.
To provide customers with a variety of ways to pay, since July 15, 2020, CPC gas station 
customers can use six third-party payment services for e-payment transactions at the full-service 
areas: LINE Pay, iPASS MONEY, Pi Mobile Wallet, JKOPay, O’Pay, and GAMA PAY. CPC Pay 
has allowed users to add VISA/MasterCard/JCB credit cards since December 29, 2020, to make 
payments. It has been optimizing the features of CPC Pay. With CPC Pay promotional campaigns, 
customers are more willing to use CPC Pay and have a more robust brand identification with CPC 
Taiwan.
Following the government’s mobile payment policy, the company allowed Taiwan Pay (debit 
card/debit account only) since March 31, 2021. CPC also installed wireless barcode readers in 
gas stations so that customers could make payments without stepping out of their cars, making it 
more convenient.20

Gas and charging stations offering comprehensive services
The multi-service business model for gas stations comprises the provision of car-washing, quick 
maintenance, CUP&GO coffee, on-site convenience stores, and the sale of superior-quality products. 
In response to the green energy policy, we are actively developing charging and swapping stations 
for electric vehicles. We have met the goal of building one thousand stations by the end of 2022. As 
of 2022, there are 273 stations offering car washing services, 66 stations offering quick maintenance 
services, and 123 stations selling CUP&GO coffee. In 2022, the gross profit of the diversification business 
exceeded NT$1.36 billion. In particular, CPC intake valve cleaners for cars and diesel vehicles sold 2.44 
million bottles, while the sales of eco-friendly laundry detergent and dishwashing detergent reached 1.21 
million bottles. Holiday gift boxes set a sales record of 186,000 boxes, and more than 1.22 million cups 
of CUP&GO coffee were sold. This fully demonstrates the channel value of gas stations, and diversified 
services have been recognized by customers.
Regarding customer service, in 2000, CPC set up the 0800-036-188 customer hotline to coordinate 
the handling and response of customer issues after integrating various professional services provided by 
different internal units. The 1912 CPC service hotline came into use in 2011; an English-language service 
was added in 2020, a Taiwanese-language service in 2021, and a Hakka service in 2022, expanding the 
company's communication with the public.

Green gas stations Environmental inclusion and mutual benefit"
"The global trend toward environmental protection has led to the popularity of sustainable, green buildings. 
Variously termed “ecological buildings” in Japan, “eco-buildings” or “sustainable buildings” in Europe, and “green 
buildings” in the USA and Taiwan, they all aim to protect ecological systems, encourage a mutually beneficial 
relationship between buildings and the environment, conserve energy and reduce both pollution and overall 
environmental impact. These sustainable design and green concepts align with CPC’s dedication to achieving 
sustainability in its operations. CPC launched a program to green its gas stations in 2013. As of December 2021, 
70 gas stations had received “green building” certification.
In 2021, to support the United Nations’ World Toilet Day, CPC launched the “CPC gas stations, going to the 
Toilet is easy” campaign, which invited employees, employee family members, and franchise partners to help 
clean up the public toilets at gas stations. In 2021 and 2022, all public toilets at CPC-owned gas stations were 
rated Excellent.

Natural Gas Supply
CPC promotes natural gas as the fuel of the future, in keeping with Taiwan’s policy aim of energy 
diversification. It is based on its inherent advantages in terms of high thermal efficiency, low pollution profile, 
and convenience that allows for safe handling. A new era of clean energy for Taiwan was ushered in with the 
completion of the country’s first LNG receiving terminal in Kaohsiung’s Yongan District in 1990, and a second-
phase expansion project was completed in December 1996, boosting the capacity to 4.5 million tons annually; A 
third-phase expansion project to satisfy demand from independent power producers (IPP) as well as consumer 
and industrial end-users in northern Taiwan commenced in July 1996. In addition to terminal-area expansion, 
this involved laying a 36-inch diameter, 238 km long undersea pipeline from the Yongan plant to Tongxiao. Its 
completion in December 2002 expanded CPC’s annual LNG handling capacity to 7.44 million tons.
Constructing a business network that increases operation capacity
With the primary purpose of supplying natural gas to the Taiwan Power Company (Taipower), industrial firms 
and household users in central and northern Taiwan, CPC built a LNG receiving terminal sited close to Taichung’s"
"Port West Pier 13 and the hinterland, with capacity of three million tons; three LNG storage tanks each of 160,000 
kiloliter capacity; gasification and gas supply facilities; and a 135-kilometer, 36-inch sea long-distance gas 
transportation pipeline from Taichung Harbor through the Tongxiao distribution center to the Datan metering plant. 
This plan was launched on July 13, 2009. The recently-completed Taichung LNG Terminal Phase II Investment 
Project calls for the construction of three additional 160,000 kiloliter above-ground storage tanks, plus another 
gasification facility at the terminal itself; a 26-inch, 21.8 km terrestrial gas pipeline between the terminal and the 
Wuxi Separation Station; and a further switching station linked to the existing 26-inch pipeline at the Wuxi site. The 
project will boost the annual LNG handling capacity of the Taichung terminal to over six million tons and ensure a 
stable, dependable supply of natural gas during the winter’s often inclement monsoon period, as well as and partly 
because of greater storage capacity in terms of the number of days’ supply of LNG on hand.
Currently, Taiwan government policies to phase out nuclear power plants and to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions mandate 50% of Taiwan’s total electricity to come from natural gas by 2025. To help reach this 
target, CPC will lease Wharves 11 and 12 and their associated facilities from the Port of Taichung to create the 
Taichung LNG Terminal’s second dedicated LNG-unloading wharf. Execution of its Phase III expansion module 
will add two 180,000 kiloliter above-ground storage tanks and their associated gasification plant. These projects 
are expected to improve the unloading energy and gas supply stability upon completion.

In order to comply with the “Capacity of Self-provided Storage Tanks for Natural Gas Production or Import 
Enterprises” revised on August 27, 2019, and the requirements to increase the number of storage tank capacity 
days and business inventory days year-on-year, CPC will continue with the Taichung Receiving Terminal New Pier 
& Terminal Expansion exterior Taichung Harbor Investment Project (which will add four above-ground full-capacity 
180,000 kiloter LNG storage tanks, gasification facilities, and two LNG-unloading wharves and other related 
facilities). After completion of the land reclamation of the North Reclamation Area (III) and the South Reclamation 
Area (IV)-2, the Nanti Rd.-crossing pipelines will connect to the existing plant area to support each other. It is 
expected that after the completion at the end of 2028, the overall equipment utilization rate can be reduced and 
the gas supply stability and safety can be improved. In addition, it is planned to build LNG receiving terminal in 
the second area of Dalin Petrochemical Oil Storage and Transportation Center (second phase of Intercontinental), 
including one LNG unloading dock, four 180,000 kilolitre above-ground storage LNG tanks, related regasification 
facilities and the gas transmission pipeline. It is expected to be completed by the end of 2031.Yong-An LNG 
receiving terminal can be back by Intercontinental LNG receiving terminal. So the equipment utilization rate of 
Yong-An LNG receiving terminal can be reduced, and improve the stability of gas supply.
CPC has constructed an extensive natural gas transmission and distribution system on Taiwan’s western 
side. It comprises approximately 2,226 kilometers of terrestrial trunk pipeline, extending from Pingtung in the 
south to Keelung in the north; and which includes eight supply centers, one transfer center and 50 distribution 
stations along its length. Current plans are centered on the goal of constructing interlocking ring-shaped 
networks to produce a figure-of-eight configuration. This will involve laying down a 238-kilometer undersea 
pipeline from the Yongan LNG Terminal to Tongxiao and a 500-kilometer terrestrial pipeline onwards from 
Yongan to Taoyuan. In addition, after the 36-inch undersea gas pipeline from the Taichung LNG plant to Datan 
power station has come on stream, it will be linked with terrestrial pipelines in central and northern Taiwan to 
form another circular formation,thus completing the planned island-wide, integrated figure-of-eight natural gas 
transmission network.24

Building the Guantang LNG Terminal, ensuring a comprehensive gas 
supply system
In compliance with government policies to phase out nuclear power plants and to create 
an environmentally-friendly, low-carbon environment, CPC plans to set up three gas-fired 
generating units at Datan Power Station. To generate abundant energy for Datan Power Station, 
the commodity sectors in the north and other customers of the power station, CPC plans to set"
"up a third LNG terminal in Kuantang Industrial Centre, comprising reception facilities which can 
hold up to three million metric tons of import quantum, two LNG storage tanks each of 160,000 
kiloliter capacity; gasification and gas supply facilities to connect with the existing gas supply 
system.
CPC’s Third LNG Receiving Terminal project got under way in 2016 and is currently 
scheduled to come on stream in June 2025. In the future, with the three terminals-one each in 
northern, central and southern Taiwan-supplying natural gas to users in their respective areas, 
there should be some reduction in the cost and risk of transmitting gas over long distances. 
The figure-of-eight combined undersea and terrestrial gas pipeline network will enhance both 
the safety and stability of gas supply through its transfer and backup functions. The completion 
of this third LNG receiving terminal project will enable CPC to construct and operate a national 
level natural gas supply system that is fully functional, stable and safe.
Towards net zero, introducing carbon-neutral LNG
As a first approach toward energy transition and net zero, CPC imported carbon neutral 
LNG cargo since 2020. To ensure the credibility of the net zero products, high quality nature-
based carbon credits have been used to offset the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
of the relevant LNG cargo, including exploration, transmission, liquefaction, shipping, 
regasification, distribution and end-use. From 2021, CPC’s carbon neutral natural gas has been 
certified as carbon neutral product in accordance with PAS2060. Carbon neutral natural gas can 
be an alternate net-zero solution for our downstream customers in Taiwan.25
Global strategy for a stable gas supply
CPC has devoted considerable efforts diversifying its sources of LNG imports to ensure 
a stable supply of natural gas for Taiwan. The source of LNG imports is all over the world, 
including the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region, Australia, North America, Central and South 
America, Africa and Europe.
In 2021, CPC imported most of its LNG from Australia, Qatar, the United States, Papua New 
Guinea and Indonesia.

Liquefied petroleum gas ķ Supporting government policy in absorbing the 
impact of surging prices
CPC’s long-standing monopoly in the LPG market was ended when the government opened it 
up to competition in 1999. Formosa Petrochemical Corp. began competing with CPC as a producer 
and importer. In response to market competition, CPC has maintained its leading market share in the 
household gas market by using its quality advantages, north-south transport links, storage systems, 
comprehensive marketing, retail network, a full grasp of international market price fluctuations, and 
reductions in procurement costs. In selling industrial gas, the company aims to raise the quality of its 
customer service and promote its products’ value to both retain existing customers and win new ones.
As a state-owned enterprise, CPC Taiwan undertook its mission to stabilize prices. In 2022, CPC 
kept LPG prices unchanged to mitigate the impact of surging prices on industries and households in 
Taiwan. CPC also complied with the government’s safety reserve policy to increase storage tank turnover 
rate and revenue. Meanwhile, the company endeavors to reinforce occupational safety and environmental 
protection protocols, fulfilling its mission to stabilize domestic LPG supply and deliver operational 
performance.
CPC LUBRICANTS ķ The BEST strategy that focuses on transition and 
development
CPC’s Lubricants Business Division (LBD) was founded on March 16, 1999. CPC is now the leader in 
Taiwan’s lubricants market with two brands: CPCLUBE (“a brand with mission”) and Mirage (“professional 
automotive lubricants”), and it sells its products to both domestic and overseas consumers.
CPC currently has more than 30 distributors, more than 600 CPC-owned gas stations, and 
distribution partnerships with major wholesalers in Taiwan. It offers the most comprehensive, convenient, 
and diversified distribution and services. Meanwhile, CPC is also actively exploring the Asia-Pacific 
and African markets, with operating offices and direct clients in China, Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia, 
Myanmar, India, Thailand, Australia, Congo, and Suriname. To break through the ASEAN tariff barrier to 
non-members, CPC has worked with a domestic warehousing company to set up Maxihub Corporation"
"in Vietnam's Tong-Nai Province as a joint venture, which officially began commercial operation in 2022, 
operating a petrochemical storage terminal and lubricant blending plant. The joint venture enjoys 
preferential tariffs for ASEAN members and the advantage of local production.
Facing the global trend of going green, CPC Lubricants Business Division adopted a “BEST” 
strategy focusing on Bio, ECO, Synthetics, and Total solutions in its transition. The division developed 
bio-lubricants made by non-petrochemicals and lubricant products specifically for wind turbines. It uses 
completely synthetic base oils, and improves the functionality and durability of lubricant products with 
innovative technologies. CPC also manufactures packaging and bottles using recycled plastic to reduce 
waste and pollution, while using new technology to maximize production efficiency. 27
As electric vehicles become more popular, the automotive lubricant market is shrinking. Thus, 
marine engine oil has become a new focus for the Lubricants Business Division. CPC now has more 
than 70 products that have received critical international certification, recognized by companies 
including MAN ES, WinGD, Wartsila, YANMAR, J-ENG, MTU, Bosch Rexroth, and Parker Denison. The 
Lubricants Business Division won the Best Product Award from the National Brand Yushan Award for 
four consecutive years (2019 to 2022). CPC lubricants won the Reader’s Digest Trusted Brand Gold 
Award in the Lubricant subcategory, and in 2022 won the highest accolade of the Platinum Award. 
These honors show that CPC lubricant products are widely recognized worldwide.
SOLVENTS & CHEMICALS ķ Responding to growing demands and expanding 
the export business
CPC Solvent & Chemical Business Division was established in April 1999. It mainly produces 
petroleum solvents, additives for refinery processes, and various products in small packages at the 
Chiayi plant. The Division outsources the production of specialty coatings to a producer in Kaohsiung. 
In terms of sales, its four major product lines include asphalt, solvents, chemicals, additives, and 
coating for storage tanks and pipeline equipment.
The asphalt products the Division produces are high-quality, have a good reputation, and are 
mainly used for domestic pavement projects. In 2022, it took about 55% domestic market share. In 
response to climate change, the Division has continued to produce Polymer-Modified Asphalt that can 
adapt to high temperatures and wet weather, and it has invested in new asphalt storage tanks in recent 
years to enhance its asphalt production and storage system further and improve domestic road quality.
Solvents produced by the Division include Aliphatic Hydrocarbon solvents, aromatics solvents, 
dearomatized aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents, toluene, mixed xylene, and various products in small 
packages. Thanks to its sound development capabilities and technologies, complete transport and 
storage system, and the quality of its premium products, the Division had about 58% market share in 
2022. It is the market leader in the domestic petroleum solvents industry.
Chemicals produced by the Division include normal paraffin, octene dimate, methanol, and 
others. In particular, its normal paraffin has not only been sold to domestic detergent producers as a 
raw material, but it has also been exported to China, India, the U.S., and some European countries 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, successfully expanding its business territory by satisfying the needs of 
different international customers with adjustments to the product ingredients.
To meet processing needs and occupational safety and environmental regulations, CPC has 
developed its own additives and specialty coatings to meet the maintenance and operational needs of 
its refineries to reduce operational risk for manufacturing equipment. In 2019, 2020, and 2022 CPC’s 
intake-system cleaners, fluorinated paint, and the Dearomatized Aliphatic Hydrocarbon Solvent D80 
won the National Brand Yushan Award for Best Product.
CPC has actively integrated the sales channels of its specialty chemicals and solvent products, 
refined its services to improve its product quality and image, and has committed itself to the

Industrial Safety & Health 
Petroleum products and natural gas are highly flammable substances. In handling them, CPC 
places heavy emphasis on industrial safety and health, as well as on fire prevention, to maintain 
continuity in operations and to prevent harm to employees, local communities, and the property 
of local people. Apart from compliance with Taiwan’s relevant laws and regulations, CPC has also"
"drafted – and strictly enforces – its own safety and loss prevention protocols by reference to those 
of advanced countries in Europe, the United States, and Japan. Such protocols have been suitably 
adapted to reflect local conditions and operational characteristics.
Enhancing occupational safety management with risk control as a priority
Industrial safety is the key to the continued sustainable future of CPC. To achieve the 100% 
industrial safety goal, with no accidents at all, CPC has constantly and actively strengthened its 
safety culture by implementing a policy based on safety disciplines, “All staff safety awareness, 
risk management, and health care.” CPC’s industrial safety performance has been recognized 
by broader society; it also often receives the annual Excellence in Organizational and Personnel 
Promotion of Occupational Safety and Health award from Taiwan’s Ministry of Labor.
The company has continued to raise awareness of issues to both its employees and external 
vendors in the interest of creating a safe and comfortable working environment through a collective 
effort. In line with its emphasis on a culture of industrial safety, CPC is putting particular effort to 
focus on the following points:
• Implementation of the Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System (TOSHMS) 
and continuous improvement concerning its operational environment. CPC received ISO45001 
reversion verification, aligning with international norms. To reinforce industrial safety practice 
mandates, CPC has established inspection and auditing teams to go onto construction sites 
for unscheduled on-site inspection and auditing, and to set out the “Management procedures 
for safety and health of contractors” and the “Guidance on safe work permit.” CPC has also 
established a contractor evaluation system to urge the implementation of self-management and 
reduce occupational accidents among their employees on CPC sites.
• In conjunction with the implementation of occupational safety laws, CPC conducts periodic 
reviews of industrial safety and health rules and continuously reviews and revises standard 
operating procedures.
• CPC is strengthening industrial health management protocols, scheduling regular employee 
health checkups, analyzing and tracking those health checkup results, promoting a healthy 
lifestyle, and emphasizing the importance of employees’ mental health.
• CPC is implementing risk management and process safety management (PSM) and establishing 
equipment safety management processes – a periodic, regular, thorough inspection of oil tanks 
and pipelines and the installation of monitors and leak detection systems along their extended 
sections.
• CPC is strengthening fire prevention and response capabilities, organizing local joint emergency 
response teams, and ensuring that personnel, facilities, and emergency response and rescue 
equipment are all available and applicable to all units to minimize losses due to fire and other 
disasters.
• CPC is implementing on-site safety inspections with graded results, continuously improving 
systems, equipment, and implementation by observing their preparedness and raising awareness 
of the importance of industrial safety disciplines.
• CPC is empowering industrial safety inspections team with senior managers using “management

Pollution Prevention and Environmental 
Protection
To fulfill its corporate responsibility, CPC has long been dedicated to various environmental 
protection efforts, including improving wastewater disposal, air pollution, waste treatment, and limiting 
the contamination of soil and groundwater. CPC implements environmental protection policies, actively 
prevents pollution, and strengthens the control of the sources of pollution. The company utilizes low-
pollution production processes and the latest pollution control facilities. CPC also uses the best available 
control technology (BACT) and equipment to reduce pollution caused by the production, transportation, 
and storage processes of its new projects.
Ecological protection with tangible results
In recent years, CPC has further deepened its commitment to ecologically restorative measures 
that include improving the quality of its petroleum products, reducing energy consumption and waste, 
and adapting to climate change. Since 1995, all of the company’s business units have introduced the 
ISO 14001 standard of the environmental management system. As of the end of 2022, 24 business 
units had received official certification. In response to the global trend, in 2004, CPC deployed an 
environmental accounting system to improve its environmental protection performance.
In all its development projects, CPC has followed through on commitments written into the 
respective environmental impact assessments (EIA). It has introduced appropriate environmental 
protection measures in response to the potential risks posed by specific development undertakings. 
It also maintains a comprehensive monitoring system to protect environmental quality and biological 
diversity around its facilities. As a result, CPC’s air pollution emissions are better than the quality 
level stipulated in the current national environmental protection regulations, improving the company’s 
performance in environmental protection.
Regarding ecology preservation, CPC has set up the Guantang Industrial Park (Port) Ecological 
Preservation Committee on November 7, 2018, for consultation and review of its environmental 
protection efforts and achievements, aiming to achieve the goals of marine environmental conservation 
and sustainable community development. Six stations have been set up throughout Taiwan to monitor 
algal reef ecology. In 2022, the Taoyuan algal reefs’ coast survey results showed that there were 39 algal 
species in total: 17 macroalgae and 22 crustose coralline algae. Regarding the number of algal species 
in each area, Guanxin Algae Reef ranks top with 34 species. In comparison, there are 33 species in 
Datan Algae Reef and Baiyu Algae Reef, receptively. When it comes to macroalgae specifically, Guanxin 
and Datan have 15 species, while Baiyu has 14. On crustose coralline algae, Guanxin and Baiyu both 
have 19 species, while Datan has 18.3132 Industrial Safety & Health
In addition to regularly surveying algal reef ecology, CPC has completed habitat restoration 
for little terns since 2019. CPC has worked with the Wild Bird Society of Taoyuan and the 
Taoyuan City Government, and the reproductive success rate has increased significantly from 
17%-30% to 68% recently. In 2022, the reproduction success rate for little terns in Taoyuan 
increased to 72%, which shows that CPC has spared no effort in ecological conservation. The 
company’s partnership with environmental organizations has yielded tangible, fruitful results."
"Significant reduction of greenhouse gases and carrying out climate risk 
assessments
Taiwan’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act was formally promulgated 
on July 1, 2015. CPC has set goals to reduce greenhouse gases in compliance with national 
policies, and it continues to monitor its emissions by calculating its greenhouse gas inventory. 
To achieve the national goal of long-term greenhouse emissions reduction, CPC introduced the 
ISO 14064-1 system in 2004 to calculate its greenhouse gas inventory, actively implemented 
its energy-saving carbon emission reduction plan, and set targets and timelines for carbon 
emission reduction for its existing plants. CPC has also imposed reduction measures according 
to the reduction plan using clean fuel, clean production, equipment efficiency improvement, 
energy saving, and waste reduction. In recent years, CPC has used the latest technology to 
improve the energy efficiency of the plants effectively. As a result, the company’s reduction in 
greenhouse emissions from 2005 to 2021, verified by a third party, was about 33.6.3233
Note 1:  In 2022, SOx emissions of the refineries increased 
compared to 2021. This is due to the Dalin Refinery 
increased operation days and fuel use for the heavy oil 
cracking plant and particular procedures.
Note 2:  The emission levels of 2020 and 2021 are the approved

September 2020. To adapt to the risks of 
climate change, CPC has participated in 
the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy 
and Guidance Program for the Energy 
Sector by the Bureau of Energy between 
2018 and 2021. It completed a risk 
assessment on strong winds and floods 
at 25 sites. In 2022, CPC optimized the 
risk assessment results of seven sites 
using the latest GIS data.3334
Industrial Safety & Health
Reducing air pollution and promoting environmental education
CPC’s air pollutants come mainly from its oil refineries and petrochemical plants. The pollutants 
include total suspended particulate matter, sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs), and others. Catering to production needs, the Dalin Refinery increased operation 
days and fuel use for heavy oil cracking plant and particular procedures because of production needs, 
leading to an increase in SOx emissions. Other emissions, such as TSP, NOx, and VOCs, all maintained 
last year’s level or saw a gradual decrease, showing that the improvement measures CPC implemented 
effectively reduced air pollution.
Since the enactment of the Environmental Education Act in 2011, CPC has actively promoted 
environment-related education and similar activities, and the concepts of environmental protection 
and of cherishing Taiwan’s natural resources. It has called on the public to come together on local 
ecological issues, showing concern for the development of local communities and taking specific 
actions, such as park and forest adoption, garbage clean-ups, and marine pollution remediation, to 
pass on a clean environment for future generations. In further educational developments in recent 
years, CPC’s Taiwan Oil Field Exhibition Hall at Chuhuangkeng in Miaoli County was officially certified 
as an environmental education facility on August 22, 2017. It is the only educational facility for oil 
extraction. Another company-developed environmental education site is the CPC Kaohsiung Refinery 
Environmental Education Park, certified as the only petrochemical industry environmental educational 
facility on January 22, 2018.
CPC is dedicated to protecting the homeland and the environment. Therefore, it strives to raise its 
environmental performance by deploying the latest pollution-control technology, actively introducing 
highly efficient processes, investing in the circular economy, waste recycling, and increasing value – all 
in the pursuit of developing sustainability in its operations and the sharing of good health and prosperity 
with citizens.

Continued compliance with regulatory requirements for pollution remediation
Following the promulgation of the Soil and Groundwater Pollution Remediation Act by the President 
in 2000, Taiwan’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has introduced related Enforcement Rules, 
subsidiary legislation, and related control standards for the Soil and Groundwater Pollution Remediation 
Act. Many CPC plant locations have been listed as sites that require pollution response, control, or 
remediation. CPC has proposed appropriate and respective pollution response, control, and remediation 
plans, and the company has implemented related soil and groundwater pollution surveys and pollution 
remediation measures as per associated regulations. In 2022, CPC had four sites listed for response 
measures, 29 for pollution control, and eight for remediation. Meanwhile, remediation had been 
completed at 45 locations by the end of 2022.
Kaohsiung Refinery was officially decommissioned at the end of November 2015, and pollution 
remediation of the area caught considerable attention. CPC presented a pollution control plan to the 
Environmental Protection Bureau of the Kaohsiung City Government for review, which the bureau 
approved on December 16, 2016. The overall pollution improvement period is 17 years. To speed up the 
revitalization of the land where the Kaohsiung Refinery was formerly sited, CPC signed an administrative 
contract entrusting Kaohsiung City Government to remediate and delist the polluted sites. CPC signed 
an administrative contract with the Public Works Bureau of the Kaohsiung City Government on May 
13, 2021. Areas with soil and groundwater pollution in Zone 3 for remediation were delisted on March 
28 and May 31, 2022, respectively. As of the end of 2022, the completion rate of pollution control and 
remediation for soil and groundwater pollution at the Kaohsiung Refinery has reached 57.14%.35Research and Development
Research and Development (R&D) is a core value for CPC’s technological innovation and corporate 
sustainability. There are three major institutes responsible for R&D in their respective areas: the Exploration & 
Development Research Institute (EDRI) in Miaoli; the Refining & Manufacturing Research Institute (RMRI) in 
Chiayi; and the Green Technology Research Institute (GTRI) in Kaohsiung.
The EDRI primarily evaluates oil and gas reserves by analyzing domestic and foreign geological/

41Human Resources
People-centered values, leading the company forward
As of the end of 2022, CPC had 16,682 employees. To fully develop their potential, CPC 
provides long-term training and career guidance, while at the same time making both incentives and 
benefits more attractive. CPC has also actively discovered managerial talent to facilitate corporate 
development with talented people of outstanding ability.
Integration of talent selection and training, investing in what the business 
needs
Regarding human resource utilization, CPC has recently engaged in organizational and process 
reengineering and formulating and carrying out a policy whereby selected employees are rotated 
through different jobs, units, and departments to use their human capital effectively. It has also 
actively recruited a cohort of young professionals to inject new blood and provide a smooth transfer 
of technical and operational knowledge, as well as commercial and competitive skills, to increase the 
competitiveness of its employees and prepare for a wave of retirements."
"In addition to using professional qualifications and personal traits as the basis for selecting 
entrants to its supervisors, CPC provides management and leadership development training to 
help its employees achieve their full potential and contribute to accomplishing corporate growth 
objectives. At the same time, the company is strengthening its on-the-job training programs at all 
levels and has integrated existing training systems into establishing the CPC Corporate University 
(CPCCU). This system offers beginner, intermediate, and advanced level courses in exploration, 
refining, marketing, and engineering - the four key areas comprising CPC’s core competencies. CPC 
has systematically enhanced specific professional expertise for employees through experiences 
passed on by senior employees, which has helped them develop a broader range of skills to optimize 
workforce utilization. The company also encourages its employees to take national qualification 
examinations in skills and allows them to obtain professionally-required certification in industrial 
safety, environmental protection, and other relevant disciplines. The company is also strengthening 
its secondary-skill training programs in its corporate transformation process. Beyond this, employees 
are selectively sent abroad for higher education, research assignments, and internships, and to 
participate in conferences and seminars on various topics.
42
Human ResourcesPassing on experience and 
cultivating professional talents
Since CPC recently hired new employees, 
on-the-job training is now combined with 
formal skills development courses. Senior 
employees are also designated as mentors to 
help new colleagues adapt to their workplace 
and responsibilities. These new employees are 
rotated, with job training provided, allowing 
them to gain experience in various positions 
and develop their talent at every level. Seniority 
requirements for promotion have been 
shortened for outstanding managers, lowering 
the age distribution in the upper management 
echelons and thus helping to motivate those 
with ambition. Concerning employee training, 
each department reviews its professional-
skill shortfalls at the beginning of the year and 
formulates a corresponding training plan in 
which outstanding personnel are recruited as 
instructors and tasked with passing on their 
operational knowledge and experience. Some departments also make on-site training arrangements for their 
junior employees, which last up to a year, depending on departmental needs. Following the e-learning trend, 
various knowledge elements and physical courses have also been digitized and uploaded to CPC’s knowledge 
base and e-learning center. This helps CPC preserve, share, and pass on core knowledge, techniques, and 
experiences, and facilitates the company’s value-adding applications. With the application of digital technology, 
multiple learning programs based on virtual-physical technology integration are developed step-by-step to help 
employees learn related knowledge and expertise anytime, anywhere.
The CPC Training Center (CPCTC) in Chiayi serves as an incubator for internal talent and a hub for passing 
on experience. It is also tasked with building a talent pool of energy and petrochemical expertise. In compliance 
with the government’s energy policy and the Energy Consumption, Energy Saving, Carbon Reduction, and 
Digital Transformation strategies, CPC has recruited not only professional talent with engineering, investment, 
trading, and management backgrounds for these business activities, but also expanded domestic and overseas 
government-industry-university-institute collaboration, and actively formulated various courses in pre-employment 
training and on-the-job training for talent in multiple fields, to maximize its contribution to the cultivation of energy 
and petrochemical talents for our country.
A friendly environment that ensures gender equality
Regarding employee incentives and benefits, CPC provides bonuses considering the company’s overall 
performance, individual contribution, and KPIs, and assigns the employee welfare committee to organize 
welfare and entertainment activities. Also, all employees are covered by national health insurance, public 
servant insurance, labor insurance, group life insurance, and casualty insurance. CPC also provides consolation 
and compassionate payments for work-related injuries, disability, or death, guaranteeing the welfare of CPC 
employees. 
Employees of all business units have access to clinics, employee cafeterias, libraries, and general stores 
in their vicinity. CPC also offers sports facilities, including swimming pools, ball courts, and gyms. Furthermore, 
CPC offers scholarships and college tuition fee loans for employees’ children; medical subsidies for employees 
and dependents; wedding, funeral, and retirement subsidies for employees; and interest-free emergency loans."
"CPC also sponsors employee group activities from ball games, bridge, chess, mountain climbing, swimming, 
and painting, to film watching, ensuring the well-being and morale of the employees. 
Regarding employee assistance programs, CPC offers various services to help employees resolve and 
prevent problems affecting their performance and motivate employees at work. CPC enhances the organization’s 
competitiveness by implementing multiple health promotion measures, creating a caring work environment, and 
building a friendly, communicative business culture. 
Additionally, CPC is dedicated to promoting gender equality and implementing relevant measures to 
build an inclusive workplace. CPC will continue to increase the number of female employees, breaking gender 
stereotypes in the industry and achieving gender equality. In 2022, CPC won the 20th Golden Carnation Awards 
for its “Women at CPC, happy enterprise and friendly workplace” project. The recognition is proof of the CPC’s 
commitment to gender equality.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021
(In Thousands of New Taiwan Dollars, Unless Stated Otherwise)
(1) Company history
CPC Corporation, Taiwan (the “Company” or CPC) was established on June 1, 1946 and engages mainly in 
oil and gas exploration, refining, procurement, transport, storage and marketing.
(2) Approval date and procedures of the financial statements:"
"The financial statements were authorized for issuance by the Board of Directors on April 19, 2023.
(3) New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted:
(a)  The impact of the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) endorsed by the Financial 
Supervisory Commission, R.O.C. which have already been adopted.
The Company has initially adopted the following new amendments, which do not have a significant impact 
on its financial statements, from January 1, 2022:
• Amendments to IAS 16 “Property, Plant and Equipment—Proceeds before Intended Use”
• Amendments to IAS 37 “Onerous Contracts—Cost of Fulfilling a Contract”
• Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018–2020
• Amendments to IFRS 3 “Reference to the Conceptual Framework”
(b) The impact of IFRS issued by the FSC but not yet effective
The Company assesses that the adoption of the following new amendments, effective for annual period 
beginning on January 1, 2023, would not have a significant impact on its financial statements:
• Amendments to IAS 1 “Disclosure of Accounting Policies”
• Amendments to IAS 8 “Definition of Accounting Estimates”
• Amendments to IAS 12 “Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction”
(c) The impact of IFRS issued by IASB but not yet endorsed by the FSC
The following new and amended standards, which may be relevant to the Company, have been issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), but have yet to be endorsed by the FSC:
Standards or 
InterpretationsContent of amendment Effective date per IASB
Amendments to IAS 
1 “Classification of 
Liabilities as Current 
or Non-current”Under existing IAS 1 requirements, companies 
classify a liability as current when they do not have an 
unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 
months after the reporting date. The amendments has 
removed the requirement for a right to be unconditional 
and instead now requires that a right to defer settlement 
must exist at the reporting date and have substance.
The amendments clarify how a company classifies 
a liability that can be settled in its own shares – e.g. 
convertible debt.January 1, 2024
Amendments to 
IAS 1 “Non-current 
Liabilities with 
Covenants”After reconsidering certain aspects of the 2020 
amendments1, new IAS 1 amendments clarify that only 
covenants with which a company must comply on or 
before the reporting date affect the classification of a 
liability as current or non-current.
Covenants with which the company must comply after 
the reporting date (i.e. future covenants) do not affect 
a liability’s classification at that date. However, when 
non-current liabilities are subject to future covenants, 
companies will now need to disclose information to 
help users understand the risk that those liabilities 
could become repayable within 12 months after the 
reporting date.January 1, 202452

interpretations on its consolidated financial position and financial performance. The results thereof will be

endorsed by the FSC, to have a significant impact on its financial statements:
•  Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 “Sale or Contribution of Assets Between an Investor and Its

(4) Summary of significant accounting policies: 
The Company is operated and managed by the Government of the Republic of China (ROC). The Company’s 
significant accounting policies conform to the accounting laws and regulations governing state-owned 
enterprises, the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers (the 
“Regulations”) and with the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”), International Accounting 
Standards (“IASs”), as well as related guidance endorsed by the Financial Supervisory Commission of the 
Republic of China. 
The Company’s annual financial statements are required to be examined by the Executive Yuan and the 
Ministry of Audit of the Control Yuan. The examinations are primarily aimed at determining the extent to 
which the Company meets its budget as approved by the Legislative Yuan. The Company’s financial 
statements are finalized on the basis of the results of these examinations. The Ministry of Audit’s adjustments 
should be reflected in the financial statements audited by independent certified public accountants. The 
opening balance of the following year of the Company’s books of accounts is based on the balance after"
"the adjustments made by the Ministry of Audit. The examination of the Company’s financial statements as of 
and for the year ended December 31, 2021 had already been completed, as explained in Note 12(b). The 
examinations of the Company’s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 by 
these government agencies were not yet completed as of the auditor’s report date.
(a) Statement of compliance 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting laws and regulations 
governing state-owned enterprises, the Regulations and the IFRSs as endorsed and issued into effect by 
the FSC.
(b) Basis of preparation 
(i) Basis of measurement
Except for the following significant accounts, the financial statements have been prepared on a 
historical cost basis:
Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value;
Fair value through other comprehensive income are measured at fair value;
Hedging derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value;
The defined benefit liability (asset) is recognized as the fair value of the plan assets less the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation.
(ii) Functional and presentation currency
The functional currency is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates. The financial statements are presented in New Taiwan dollars, which is the Company’s 
functional currency. All financial information presented in New Taiwan dollars has been rounded to the 
nearest thousand.
(c) Classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities 
An asset is classified as current under one of the following criteria, and all other assets are classified as 
noncurrent.
(i) It is expected to be realized, or intended to be sold or consumed, in the normal operating cycle;
(ii) It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
(iii) It is expected to be realized within twelve months after the reporting period; or 53
(iv)  The asset is cash or a cash equivalent unless the asset is restricted from being exchanged or used to 
settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.
A liability is classified as current under one of the following criteria, and all other liabilities are classified as 
noncurrent.
An entity shall classify a liability as current when:
(i) It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle;
(ii) It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
(iii) It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or 
(iv)  It does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months 
after the reporting period. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its 
settlement by issuing equity instruments do not affect its classification.
(d) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash, cash in bank, and short term, highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes 
in value. Time deposits which meet the above definition and are held for the purpose of meeting short 
term cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes should be recognized as cash 
equivalents. 
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Company’s cash 
management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement 
of cash flows.
(e) Financial instruments
Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognized when they are originated. All other 
financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognized when the Company becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a 
significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not 
at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition 
or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the 
transaction price.
(i) Financial assets 
All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade 
date basis.
On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortized cost; fair value through 
other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Financial assets are 
not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for 
managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of 
the first reporting period following the change in the business model.
1) Financial assets at amortized cost
A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not"
"designated as at FVTPL:
•  it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash 
flows; and
•  its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal 
and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
These assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost, which is the amount at which the 
financial asset is measured at initial recognition, plus/minus, the cumulative amortization using the 
effective interest method, adjusted for any loss allowance. Interest income, foreign exchange gains 
and losses, as well as impairment, are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition 
is recognized in profit or loss.
2) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not 
designated as at FVTPL:
•  it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash 
flows and selling financial assets; and54
Financial Statements
•  its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal 
and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Company may 
irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment’s fair value in other 
comprehensive income. This election is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis.
Debt investments at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated 
using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are 
recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive 
income. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are 
reclassified to profit or loss.
Equity investments at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as 
income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the 
investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income and are never 
reclassified to profit or loss.
Dividend income is recognized in profit or loss on the date on which the Group’s right to receive payment 
is established.
3) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
All financial assets not classified as amortized cost or FVOCI described as above are measured 
at FVTPL, including derivative financial assets and accounts receivable, which is presented as 
accounts receivable. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial 
asset, which meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI, as at FVTPL if 
doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest 
or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss.
4) Business model assessment
The Company makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial 
asset is held at portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and 
information is provided to management. The information considered includes:
•  the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. 
These include whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income, 
maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the 
duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realizing cash flows through the sale 
of the assets;
• how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Company’s management;
•  the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within 
that business model) and how those risks are managed;
•  how managers of the business are compensated — e.g. whether compensation is based on the 
fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and 
•  the frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such 
sales and expectations about future sales activity.
Transfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are 
not considered sales for this purpose, and are consistent with the Company’s continuing recognition 
of the assets.
Financial assets that are held for trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a 
fair value basis are measured at FVTPL. 
5) Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest
For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial assets on 
initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit"
"risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other 
basic lending risks and costs, as well as a profit margin.
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the 
Company considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the 
financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual 
cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the Company 
considers:55
•  contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flow;
•  terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features;
•  prepayment and extension features; and
•  terms that limit the Company’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse 
features).
6) Impairment of financial assets
The Company recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets measured 
at amortized cost (including cash and cash equivalents, amortized costs, accounts receivable, 
other receivable, guarantee deposit paid and other financial assets), debt investments measured at 
FVOCI, accounts receivable measured at FVOCI and contract assets. 
The Company measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit loss (ECL), 
except for the following which are measured as 12-month ECL:
•  debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and
•  other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default occurring over 
the expected life of the financial instrument) has not increased significantly since initial recognition.
Loss allowance for trade receivables and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal 
to lifetime ECL.
Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a 
financial instrument.
12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 
months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 
12 months). 
The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over 
which the Group is exposed to credit risk.
When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since 
initial recognition and when estimating ECL, the Company considers reasonable and supportable 
information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative 
and qualitative information and analysis based on the Company’s historical experience and informed 
credit assessment as well as forward-looking information. 
The Company considers a debt security to have low credit risk when its credit risk rating is 
equivalent to the globally understood definition of ‘investment grade which is considered to be BBB-
or higher per Standard & Poor’s, Baa3 or higher per Moody’s or twA or higher per Taiwan Ratings’. 
ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the 
present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e the difference between the cash flows due to the Company in 
accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive). ECLs are 
discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.
At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost 
and debt securities at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or 
more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset 
have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable 
data:
• significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
• a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due;
•  the lender of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower’s financial 
difficulty, having granted to the borrower a concession that the lender would not otherwise 
consider;
• it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; or
• the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties. 
Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross 
carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit 
or loss and is recognized in other comprehensive income instead of reducing the carrying amount 
of the asset. The Company recognizes the amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) in profit or 
loss, as an impairment gain or loss.56
Financial Statements
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Company has no reasonable"
"expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. For corporate 
customers, the Company individually makes an assessment with respect to the timing and amount 
of write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery. The Company expects 
no significant recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets that are written off 
could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group’s procedures for 
recovery of amounts due.
7) Derecognition of financial assets
The Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the 
financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction 
in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred 
or in which the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.
The Company enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of 
balance sheet, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred 
assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognized.
(ii) Financial liabilities
1) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is 
classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as 
such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and 
losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss. 
Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognized in profit or loss.
2) Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Company derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged 
or cancelled, or expire. The Company also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are 
modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new 
financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value.
On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount of a financial 
liability extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or 
liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss.
(iii) Derivative financial instruments
The Company enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to 
price changes and foreign exchange rate risks, including foreign exchange forward contracts and 
petroleum swap contracts.
Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are 
measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognized in profit or loss.
(f) Inventories 
Inventories include raw materials, finished goods, work in process, semi-finished goods, merchandise, 
construction in progress, merchandise in transit-crude oil, and merchandise in transit-fuel oil. Inventories 
are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory write-downs are made by item, except 
where it may be appropriate to Company similar or related items. Net realizable value is the estimated 
selling price of inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.
Inventories are recorded at weighted-average cost on the balance sheet date.
(g) Investment in associates 
An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary 
nor an interest in a joint venture.
The Company uses the equity method to account for its investments in associates.
Under the equity method, investments in an associate are initially recognized at cost and adjusted 
thereafter to recognize the Company’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the 
associate. The Company also recognizes the changes in the Company’s share of equity of associates.57
If the cost of acquisition exceeds the Company’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and 
liabilities of an associate recognized at the date of acquisition, this excess is recognized as goodwill, 
which is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not amortized. If the Company’s 
share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities exceeds the cost of acquisition, after 
reassessment, this excess is recognized immediately in profit or loss.
The entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment as a single"
"asset by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized is 
deducted from the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized 
to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.
When the Company transacts with its associate, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with 
the associate are recognized in the Company’s financial statements only to the extent of interests in the 
associate that are not related to the Company.
(h) Property, plant and equipment 
(i) Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes professional fees and borrowing costs eligible for 
capitalization.
Each part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the 
total cost of the item shall be depreciated separately unless the useful life and depreciation method of 
that significant part are the same as those of another significant part of that same item.
The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment is 
determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of 
the item, and it shall be recognized in profit or loss.
(ii) Subsequent cost
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the expenditure will flow to the Company. The carrying amount of those parts of 
fixed assets that are replaced is derecognized. Ongoing repairs and maintenance are expensed as 
incurred.
(iii) Depreciation
Such properties are depreciated and classified to the appropriate categories of property, plant and 
equipment when completed and ready for intended use.
Depreciation of the equipment in oil and gas production mine is computed using the unit-of-output 
method. Depreciation of the remaining property, plant and equipment is computed using the straight-
line method. Each significant part is depreciated separately. The estimated useful lives, residual values 
and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any 
changes in estimates accounted for prospectively.
On derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment, the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognized in profit or loss.
(i) Lease 
(i) Lease 
1) Identifying a lease
At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A 
contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified 
asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the 
right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether:
a)  the contract involves the use of an identified asset – this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, 
and should be physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically 
distinct asset. If the supplier has a substantive substitution right, then the asset is not identified; 
and
b)  the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the 
asset throughout the period of use; and
c)  the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset when it has the decision-making rights 
that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used. In rare cases 
where the decision about how and for what purpose the asset is used is predetermined, the 
Company has the right to direct the use of an asset if either:58
Financial Statements
— the Company has the right to operate the asset; or
—  the Company designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it will be 
used.
2)  Leasee
The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. 
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial 
direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to 
restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the 
commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end 
of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if 
any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at"
"the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot 
be reliably determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its 
incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:
— fixed payments;
—  variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or 
rate as at the commencement date;
— amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and
—  payments for purchase or termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised.
The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured 
when:
— there is a change in future lease payments arising from the change in an index or rate; or
—  there is a change in the Company’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a 
residual value guarantee; or
—  there is a change of its assessment on whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or 
termination option; or
—  there is a change of its assessment of lease period on whether it will exercise extension or 
termination option; or
— there is any lease modifications
When the lease liability is remeasured, other than lease modifications, a corresponding adjustment 
is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or in profit and loss if the carrying amount of 
the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
When the lease liability is remeasured to reflect the partial or full termination of the lease for lease 
modifications that decrease the scope of the lease, the Company accounts for the remeasurement 
of the lease liability by decreasing the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset to reflect the partial 
or full termination of the lease, and recognize in profit or loss any gain or loss relating to the partial or 
full termination of the lease.
The Company presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment and lease 
liabilities as a separate line item respectively in the statement of financial position.
The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term 
leases of machinery that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets, 
including IT equipment. The Company recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases 
as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
3) Lessor
When the Company acts as a lessor, it determines at lease commencement whether each lease 
is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Company makes an overall 
assessment of whether the lease transfers to the lessee substantially all of the risks and rewards 
of ownership incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a 
finance lease; if not, then the lease is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Company 
considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of 
the asset.59
When the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the 
sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-
use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a 
short-term lease to which the Company applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the 
sub-lease as an operating lease.
If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Company applies IFRS15 to 
allocate the consideration in the contract.
(j) Investment property 
Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation (including 
property under construction for such purposes). Investment properties also include land held for a 
currently undetermined future use.
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, investment properties are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment loss. Depreciation is recognized using the straight-line method.
On derecognition of an investment property, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset is included in profit or loss.
(k) Intangible assets 
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are initially measured at cost and 
subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment loss.
Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from 
the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life, residual value, and amortization method are 
reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a"
"prospective basis. The residual value of an intangible asset with a finite useful life should be assumed to be 
zero unless the Company expects to dispose of the intangible asset before the end of its economic life.
(l) Oil and gas interests and exploration expenses 
All geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged to current income.
The costs of drilling exploratory wells (“exploration well expenses”) in sites that have not yet proven to 
contain reserves of commercial quantities (“unproven sites”) are initially charged to current income. 
Exploration well expenses are subsequently capitalized as part of “oil and gas interests” accounts when 
(i) sites are proven to contain mineral reserves of commercial quantities and (ii) the construction of the 
wellhead equipment or offshore production platforms and flow lines is complete. The exploration expenses 
incurred in the current year are reclassified from “exploration expenses” to assets. Costs already charged 
to income in prior years are recognized as assets and as “non-operating income.”
The costs of drilling commercial wells, which are constructed after the sites are proven to contain mineral 
reserves of commercial quantities, are capitalized as assets. However, if the commercial wells turn out to 
be dry, such costs are charged to current income.
For oil site acquisitions, the Company’s payments for this purchase or investments in foreign joint ventures 
involving interest in oil sites-including the Company’s share in the costs of drilling commercial wells, 
production, transport and storage equipment but excluding the Company’s share in the costs of drilling 
exploratory wells and other exploration expenses-are capitalized as oil and gas interests. The Company’s 
share in joint ventures’ net earnings (or net losses) is recognized as other operating revenues (or other 
operating costs). The Company recognizes earnings remitted by joint ventures as a reduction of oil and 
gas interests. These costs are amortized at the ratio of the actual quantity of minerals extracted from 
the wells for the year to the estimated mineral reserve. The amortized costs and operating expenses 
paid to joint ventures are regarded as the cost of the Company’s share of the oil and gas extracted. The 
accompanying financial statements included the related sales and cost of goods sold attributable to the 
Company’s share of the oil and gas sold by the joint ventures.
For domestic sites and sites of product-sharing contracts, the Company amortizes the amount recognized 
in oil and gas interests by the ratio of actual quantity produced in the period over total estimated 
production quantity of the site. The Company accounts for minerals produced at amortized cost plus the 
site operation expenses paid, and recognizes crude oil inventory and natural gas inventory by the output 
value method. The Company recognizes sales and cost of goods sold on the sale of inventory.
For sites of Provision of Services Contract, the Company amortized the amount recognized in oil and gas 
interests in the same method of that of domestic sites and sites of product-sharing contract. The Company 
accounts for the amortized amount and the site operation expenses paid as other operating costs. On 
the other hand, the Company recognized other operating income by multiplying produced quantity to a 
revenue rate contracted with local oil site governments.60
Financial Statements
The Company recognizes earnings from Sanga Sanga and translation adjustments based on the financial 
statements of Sanga Sanga for the same reporting period as that of the Company.
Profit and loss generated from the derecognition of oil and gas interest is measured as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and recognized in statement of 
income in the period of derecognition.
(m) Impairment of non financial assets 
The carrying amounts of the Company’s non financial assets, other than assets arising from inventories 
and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication 
of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. If it is not 
possible to determine the recoverable amount (the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its 
value in use) for the individual asset, then the Company will have to determine the recoverable amount for 
the asset’s cash generating unit (CGU).
The recoverable amount for an individual asset or a CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell 
and its value in use. When evaluating value in use, the pretax discount rate is used to estimate the future 
cash flows. The discount rate should reflect the evaluation of specific risk resulting from the impact of the 
current market on the time value of money and on the asset or CGU.
If, and only if, the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount"
"of the asset shall be reduced to its recoverable amount; and that reduction will be accounted as an 
impairment loss, which shall be recognized immediately in profit or loss.
An assessment is made at the end of each reporting period as to whether there is any indication that an 
impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset may no longer exist or may have decreased. If 
any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of that asset is estimated. 
An impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset is reversed if, and only if, there has been a 
change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss 
was recognized.
(n) Provisions 
A provision, including those arising from the contractual obligation specified in a service concession 
arrangement to maintain or restore the infrastructure before it is handed over to the grantor, is recognized if, as 
a result of a past event, the Group has a present obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable 
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognized as 
finance cost.
(o) Revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in 
exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when 
it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a good or a service to a customer. The 
accounting policies for the Company’s main types of revenue are explained below.
(i)  Sale of goods
The Company manufactures and sells its products to consumers in the retail market. The Company 
recognizes revenue when a customer takes possession of the product. Payment of the transaction 
price is due immediately when the customer purchases the product.
(ii) Customer loyalty program
The Company operates a customer loyalty program to its customers. Customers obtain points for 
purchases made, which entitle them to discount on future purchases. The Company considers that the 
points provide a material right to customers that they would not receive without entering into a contract. 
Therefore, the promise to provide points to the customer is a separate performance obligation. The 
transaction price is allocated to the product and the points on a relative stand-alone selling price 
basis. Management estimates the stand-alone selling price per point on the basis of the discount 
granted when the points are redeemed and on the basis of the likelihood of redemption, based on past 
experience. The stand-alone selling price of the product sold is estimated on the basis of the retail 
price. The Company has recognized contract liability at the time of sale on the basis of the principle 
mentioned above. Revenue from the award points is recognized when the points are redeemed or 
when they expire.61
(p) Employee benefits 
(i)  Short-term employee benefits
Liabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted 
amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the related service.
(ii)  Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognized as an expense when 
employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.
Defined benefit costs (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined 
benefit retirement benefit plans are determined using the projected unit credit method. Service 
cost (including current service cost) and net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) are 
recognized as employee benefits expense in the period they occur. Remeasurement, comprising 
actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in 
other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in 
other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in unappropriated earnings and will not be 
reclassified to profit or loss. 
Net defined benefit liability represents the actual deficit in the Company’s defined benefit plan.
(iii) Other long-term employee benefits
Other long-term employee benefits are accounted for in the same way as the accounting required for 
defined benefit plan except that remeasurement is recognized in profit or loss.
(q) Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are 
added to the cost of these assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use 
or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on"
"qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.
Other than stated above, all other borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they 
are incurred.
(r) Income taxes 
Income tax expenses include both current taxes and deferred taxes. Except for expenses related to business 
combinations or recognized directly in equity or other comprehensive income, all current and deferred taxes 
are recognized in profit or loss.
Current taxes include tax payables and tax deduction receivables on taxable gains (losses) for the year 
calculated using the statutory tax rate on the reporting date or the actual legislative tax rate, as well as tax 
adjustments related to prior years.
Deferred taxes arise due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes and their respective tax bases.
A deferred tax asset is recognized for the carry forward of unused tax losses, unused tax credits, and 
deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available 
against which the unused tax losses, unused tax credits, and deductible temporary differences can be utilized. 
Such unused tax losses, unused tax credits, and deductible temporary differences are also revaluated every 
year on the financial reporting date, and adjusted based on the probability that future taxable profit will be 
available against which the unused tax losses, unused tax credits, and deductible temporary differences can 
be utilized.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in 
associates, except where the Company can control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deductible temporary differences 
associated with such investments and interests are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there 
will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the temporary differences and they are expected to 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in 
which the liability is settled or the asset realized, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and 
assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the 
end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.62
Financial Statements
(s) Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated as the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company 
divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is 
calculated as the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company divided by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding after adjustment for the effects of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. 
The Company does not have potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
(t) Operating segments 
An operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may 
earn revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other 
components of the Company). Operating results of the operating segment are regularly reviewed by the 
Company’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment 
and to assess its performance. Each operating segment consists of standalone financial information.
(5) Significant accounting assumptions and judgments, and major sources of estimation uncertainty:
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with the accounting laws and regulations governing 
state-owned enterprises, the Regulations and with the IFRSs, IASs, interpretations as well as related guidance 
endorsed by the FSC of the Republic of China requires management to make judgments, estimates, and 
assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amount of assets, 
liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The management continues to monitor the accounting estimates and assumptions. The management 
recognizes any changes in accounting estimates during the period and the impact of those changes in 
accounting estimates in the following period.
Information about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on 
the amounts recognized in the financial statements is as follows:
Judgment regarding significant influence of investees
The company holds 35%-49% of the voting shares of several investee companies, but because the remaining"
"equity of these investee companies are concentrated in very few shareholders, the company cannot exercise 
more than half of the voting rights, nor can it obtain a majority of directors’ seats. Therefore, the company has 
only significant influence on these investee companies.
Among the uncertainties of the assumptions and estimates, the relevant information that has significant risks 
may cause critical adjustments in the following years is as follows:
(a) Estimated impairment of trade receivables
The Company has estimated the loss allowance of trade receivable that is based on the risk of a default 
occurring and the rate of expected credit loss. The Company has considered historical experience, 
current economic conditions and forward-looking information at the reporting date to determine the 
assumptions to be used in calculating the impairments and the selected inputs. The relevant assumptions 
and input values, please refer to note 6(c). 63
