An introduction to crude oil and its processing
D.S.J. Jones
The wheel, without doubt, was man’ s greatest invention. However until the late 18th"
"century and early 19th century the motivation and use of the wheel was limited eitherby muscle power, man or animal, or by energy naturally occurring from water ﬂow andwind. The invention of the steam engine provided, for the ﬁrst time, a motive powerindependent of muscle or the natural elements. This ignited the industrial revolutionof the 19th century, with its feverish hunt for fossil fuels to generate the steam. It alsoinitiated the development of the mass production of steel and other commodities.
Late in the 19th century came the invention of the internal combustion engine with its
requirement for energy derived from crude oil. This, one can say, sparked the secondindustrial revolution, with the establishment of the industrial scene of today and itscontinuing development. The petroleum products from the crude oil used initially forthe energy required by the internal combustion engine, have mushroomed to becomethe basis and source of some of our chemical, and pharmaceutical products.
The development of the crude oil reﬁning industry and the internal combustion engine
have inﬂuenced each other during the 20th century. Other factors have also contributedto accelerate the development of both. The major ones of these are the increasingawareness of environmental contamination, and the increasing demand for fastertravel which led to the development of the aircraft industry with its need for higherquality petroleum fuels. The purpose of this introductory chapter is to describe anddeﬁne some of the basic measures and parameters used in the petroleum reﬁningindustry. These set the stage for the detail examination of the industry as a whole andwhich are provided in subsequent chapters of this encyclopedia.
The composition and characteristics of crude oil
Crude oil is a mixture of literally hundreds of hydrocarbon compounds ranging in
size from the smallest, methane, with only one carbon atom, to large compounds
12 CHAPTER 1
containing 300 and more carbon atoms. A major portion of these compounds are
parafﬁns or isomers of parafﬁns. A typical example is butane shown below:

 C ⎯ C ⎯ H Isobutane (denoted as iC4)

Most of the remaining hydrocarbon compounds are either cyclic parafﬁns called
naphthenes or deeply dehydrogenated cyclic compounds as in the aromatic family ofhydrocarbons. Examples of these are shown below:

Only the simplest of these homologues can be isolated to some degree of purityon a commercial scale. Generally, in reﬁning processes, isolation of relatively pureAN INTRODUCTION TO CRUDE OIL AND ITS PROCESSING 3
products is restricted to those compounds lighter than C7’ s. The majority of hydrocar-
bon compounds present in crude oil have been isolated however, but under delicatelaboratory conditions. In reﬁning processes the products are identiﬁed by groups ofthese hydrocarbons boiling between selective temperature ranges. Thus, for examplea naphtha product would be labeled as a 90
◦Ct o1 4 0◦C cut.
Not all compounds contained in crude oil are hydrocarbons. There are present also asimpurities, small quantities of sulfur, nitrogen and metals. By far the most importantand the most common of these impurities is sulfur. This is present in the form ofhydrogen sulﬁde and organic compounds of sulfur. These organic compounds arepresent through the whole boiling range of the hydrocarbons in the crude. They aresimilar in structure to the hydrocarbon families themselves, but with the additionof one or more sulfur atoms. The simplest of these is ethyl mercaptan which has amolecular structure as follows:
H  H
HHEthyl Mercaptan H⎯ C ⎯ C⎯SH⏐
⏐⏐⏐
The higher carbon number ranges of these sulfur compounds are thiophenes which
are found mostly in the heavy residuum range and disulﬁdes found in the middledistillate range of the crude. The sulfur from these heavier sulfur products can only beremoved by converting the sulfur to H
2S in a hydrotreating process operating under
severe conditions of temperature and pressure and over a suitable catalyst. The lightersulfur compounds are usually removed as mercaptans by extraction with caustic sodaor other suitable proprietary solvents.
Organic chloride compounds are also present in crude oil. These are not removed
as such but metallic protection is applied against corrosion by HCl in the primarydistillation processes. This protection is in the form of monel lining in the sections ofthe process most vulnerable to chloride attack. Injection of ammonia is also appliedto neutralize the HCl in these sections of the equipment.
The most common metal impurities found in crude oils are nickel, vanadium, and"
"sodium. These are not very volatile and are found in the residuum or fuel oil productsof the crude oil. These are not removed as metals from the crude and normally they areonly a nuisance if they affect further processing of the oil or if they are a deterrent tothe saleability of the fuel product. For example, the metals cause severe deteriorationin catalyst life of most catalytic processes. In the quality of saleable fuel oil productshigh concentrations of nickel and vanadium are unacceptable in fuel oils used in theproduction of certain steels. The metals can be removed with the glutinous portion ofthe fuel oil product called asphaltenes. The most common process used to accomplishthis is the extraction of the asphaltenes from the residue oils using propane as solvent.4 CHAPTER 1
Nitrogen, the remaining impurity is usually found as dissolved gas in the crude or as
amines or other nitrogen compounds in the heavier fractions. It is a problem only withcertain processes in naphtha product range (such as catalytic reforming). It is removedwith the sulfur compounds in this range by hydrotreating the feed to these processes.
Although the major families or homologues of hydrocarbons found in all crude oils
as described earlier are the parafﬁns, cyclic parafﬁns and aromatics, there is a fourthgroup. These are the unsaturated or oleﬁnic hydrocarbons. They are not naturallypresent in any great quantity in most crude oils, but are often produced in signiﬁcantquantities during the processing of the crude oil to reﬁned products. This occursin those processes which subject the oil to high temperature for a relatively longperiod of time. Under these conditions the saturated hydrocarbon molecules breakdown permanently losing one or more of the four atoms attached to the quadrivalentcarbon. The resulting hydrocarbon molecule is unstable and readily combines withitself (forming double bond links) or with similar molecules to form polymers. Anexample of such an unsaturated compound is as follows:
H
 H ⎯ C ⎯⎯ C ⎯ H⏐H
⏐
Ethylene
Note the double bond in this compound linking the two carbon atoms.
Although all crude oils contain the composition described above, rarely are there
two crude oils with the same characteristics. This is so because every crude oil fromwhatever geographical source contains different quantities of the various compoundsthat make up its composition. Crude oils produced in Nigeria for example would behigh in cyclic parafﬁn content and have a relatively low speciﬁc gravity. Crude drilledin some of the ﬁelds in Venezuela on the other hand would have a very high gravityand a low content of material boiling below 350
◦C. The following table summarizes
some of the crude oils from various locations (Table 1.1).
Worthy of note in the above table is the difference in the character of the various
crudes that enables reﬁners to improve their operation by selecting the best crude orcrudes that meet their product marketing requirements. For example, where a reﬁningproduct slate demands a high quantity of ‘no lead’ gasoline and a modest outlet forfuel oils then a crude oil feed such as Hassi Messaoud would be a prime choice. Itsselection provides a high naphtha yield with a high naphthene content as catalyticreforming feedstock. Fuel oil in this case also is less than 50% of the barrel. TheIranian light crude would also be a contender but for the undesirably high metalcontent of the fuel oil (Residuum).
In the case of a good middle of the road crude, Kuwait or the Arabian crude oils offer
a reasonably balanced product slate with good middle distillate quality and yields.Table 1.1. Characteristics of some crude oils from various world-wide locations

56 CHAPTER 1
For bitumen manufacture and lube oil manufacture the South American crude oils are"
"formidable competitors. Both major crudes from this area, Bachequero, the heaviercrude and Tia Juana, the lighter, are highly acidic (Naphthenic acids) which enhancebitumen and lube oil qualities. There is a problem with these crude oils however asnaphthenic acid is very corrosive in atmospheric distillation columns, particularlyin the middle distillate sections. Normal distillation units may require relining ofsections of the tower with 410 stainless steel if extended processing of these crudeoils is envisaged.
Reﬁners often mix selective crude oils to optimize a product slate that has been
programmed for the reﬁnery. This exercise requires careful examination of the variouscrude assays (data compilation) and modeling the reﬁnery operation to set the crudeoil mix and its operating parameters.
The crude oil assay
The crude oil assay is a compilation of laboratory and pilot plant data that deﬁne
the properties of the speciﬁc crude oil. At a minimum the assay should contain adistillation curve for the crude and a speciﬁc gravity curve. Most assays howevercontain data on pour point (ﬂowing criteria), sulfur content, viscosity, and many otherproperties. The assay is usually prepared by the company selling the crude oil, it is usedextensively by reﬁners in their plant operation, development of product schedules, andexamination of future processing ventures. Engineering companies use the assay datain preparing the process design of petroleum plants they are bidding on or, havingbeen awarded the project, they are now building.
In order to utilize the crude oil assay it is necessary to understand the data it provides
and the signiﬁcance of some of the laboratory tests that are used in its compilation.Some of these are summarized below, and are further described and discussed in otherchapters of the Handbook.
The true boiling point curve
This is a plot of the boiling points of almost pure components, contained in the crude oil
or fractions of the crude oil. In earlier times this curve was produced in the laboratoryusing complex batch distillation apparatus of a hundred or more equilibrium stagesand a very high reﬂux ratio. Nowadays this curve is produced by mass spectrometrytechniques much quicker and more accurately than by batch distillation. A typicaltrue boiling point curve (TBP) is shown in Figure 1.10.
The ASTM distillation curve
While the TBP curve is not produced on a routine basis the ASTM distillation curves
are. Rarely however is an ASTM curve conducted on the whole crude. This typeAN INTRODUCTION TO CRUDE OIL AND ITS PROCESSING 7
of distillation curve is used however on a routine basis for plant and product qual-
ity control. This test is carried out on crude oil fractions using a simple apparatusdesigned to boil the test liquid and to condense the vapors as they are produced. Vaportemperatures are noted as the distillation proceeds and are plotted against the distillaterecovered. Because only one equilibrium stage is used and no reﬂux is returned, theseparation of components is poor. Thus, the initial boiling point (IBP) for ASTM ishigher than the corresponding TBP point and the ﬁnal boiling point (FBP) of theASTM is lower than that for the TBP curve. There is a correlation between the ASTMand the TBP curve, and this is dealt with later in this chapter.
API gravity
This is an expression of the density of an oil. Unless stated otherwise the API gravityrefers to density at 60
◦F (15.6◦C). Its relationship with speciﬁc gravity is given by
the expression
API◦=141.5

Flash points
The ﬂash point of an oil is the temperature at which the vapor above the oil will
momentarily ﬂash or explode. This temperature is determined by laboratory testingusing an apparatus consisting of a closed cup containing the oil, heating and stirringequipment, and a special adjustable ﬂame. The type of apparatus used for middledistillate and fuel oils is called the Pensky Marten (PM), while the apparatus used inthe case of Kerosene and lighter distillates is called the Abel. Reference to these testsare given later in this Handbook, and full details of the tests methods and proceduresare given in ASTM Standards Part 7, Petroleum products and Lubricants. There aremany empirical methods for determining ﬂash points from the ASTM distillationcurve. One such correlation is given by the expression

Octane numbersOctane numbers are a measure of a gasoline’ s resistance to knock or detonation ina cylinder of a gasoline engine. The higher this resistance is the higher will be theefﬁciency of the fuel to produce work. A relationship exists between the antiknockcharacteristic of the gasoline (octane number) and the compression ratio of the enginein which it is to be used. The higher the octane rating of the fuel then the higher thecompression ratio of engine in which it can be used.
By deﬁnition, an octane number is that percentage of isooctane in a blend of isooctane"
"and normal heptane that exactly matches the knock behavior of the gasoline. Thus, a 90octane gasoline matches the knock characteristic of a blend containing 90% isooctaneand 10% n-heptane. The knock characteristics are determined in the laboratory using8 CHAPTER 1
a standard single cylinder test engine equipped with a super sensitive knock meter.
The reference fuel (isooctane blend) is run and compared with a second run usingthe gasoline sample. Details of this method are given in the ASTM standards, Part 7Petroleum products and Lubricants.
Two octane numbers are usually determined. The ﬁrst is the research octane number
(ON res or RON) and the second is the motor octane number (ON mm or MON).The same basic equipment is used to determine both octane numbers, but the enginespeed for the motor method is much higher than that used to determine the researchnumber. The actual octane number obtained in a commercial vehicle would be some-where between these two. The signiﬁcance of these two octane numbers is to evaluatethe sensitivity of the gasoline to the severity of operating conditions in the engine.The research octane number is usually higher than the motor number, the differencebetween them is termed the ‘sensitivity of the gasoline.’
Viscosity
The viscosity of an oil is a measure of its resistance to internal ﬂow and is an indication
of its lubricating qualities. In the oil industry it is usual to quote viscosities eitherin centistokes (which is the unit for kinematic viscosity), seconds Saybolt universal,seconds Saybolt furol, or seconds Redwood. These units have been correlated andsuch correlations can be found in most data books. In the laboratory, test data onviscosities is usually determined at temperatures of 100
◦F , 130◦F , or 210◦F . In the
case of fuel oils temperatures of 122◦F and 210◦F are used.
Cloud and pour points
Cloud and Pour Points are tests that indicate the relative coagulation of wax in the
oil. They do not measure the actual wax content of the oil. In these tests, the oil isreduced in temperature under strict control using an ice bath initially and then a frozenbrine bath, and ﬁnally a bath of dry ice (solid CO
2). The temperature at which the oil
becomes hazy or cloudy is taken as its cloud point. The temperature at which the oilceases to ﬂow altogether is its pour point.
Sulfur content
This is self explanatory and is usually quoted as %wt for the total sulfur in the oil.Assays change in the data they provide as the oils from the various ﬁelds change with
age. Some of these changes may be quite signiﬁcant and users usually request updateddata for deﬁnitive work, such as process design or evaluation. The larger producers ofthe crude oil provide laboratory test services on an ‘on going’ basis for these users.AN INTRODUCTION TO CRUDE OIL AND ITS PROCESSING 9
The next few sections of this chapter illustrate how the assay data and basic petroleum
reﬁning processes are used to develop a process conﬁguration for an oil reﬁningcomplex.
Other basic deﬁnitions and correlations
As described earlier the composition of crude oil and its fractions are not expressed
in terms of pure components, but as ‘cuts’ expressed between a range of boilingpoints. These ‘cuts’ are further deﬁned by splitting them into smaller sections andtreating those sections as though they were pure components. As such, each of thesecomponents will have precise properties such as speciﬁc gravity, viscosity, moleweight, pour point, etc. These components are referred to as pseudo components andare deﬁned in terms of their mid boiling point.
Before describing in detail the determination of pseudo components and their appli-
cation in the prediction of the properties of crude oil fractions it is necessary to deﬁnesome of the terms used in the crude oil analysis. These are as follows:
Cut point
A cut point is deﬁned as that temperature on the whole crude TBP curve that representsthe limits (upper and lower) of a fraction to be produced. Consider the curve shownin Figure 1.1 of a typical crude oil TBP curve.

A fraction with an upper cut point of 100◦F produces a yield of 20% volume of the
whole crude as that fraction. The next adjacent fraction has a lower cut point of 100◦F
and an upper one of 200◦F this represents a yield of 30−20% =10% volume on crude
End points"
"While the cut point is an ideal temperature used to deﬁne the yield of a fraction, theend points are the actual terminal temperatures of a fraction produced commercially.No process has the capability to separate perfectly the components of one fractionfrom adjacent ones. When two fractions are separated in a commercial process someof the lighter components remain in the adjacent lighter fraction. Likewise some of theheavier components in the fraction ﬁnd their way into the adjacent heavier fraction.Thus, the actual IBP of the fraction will be lower than the initial cut point, and its FBPwill be higher than the corresponding ﬁnal cut point. This is also shown in Figure 1.1.
Mid boiling point components
In compiling the assay narrow boiling fractions are distilled from the crude, and areanalyzed to determine their properties. These are then plotted against the mid boilingpoint of these fractions to produce a smooth correlation curve. To apply these curvesfor a particular calculation it is necessary to divide the TBP curve of the crude, or frac-tions of the crude, into mid boiling point components. To do this, consider Figure 1.2.For the ﬁrst component take an arbitrary temperature point A. Draw a horizontal linethrough this from the 0% volume. Extend the line until the area between the lineand the curve on both sides of the temperature point A are equal. The length of thehorizontal line measures the yield of component A having a mid boiling point A
◦F.
Repeat for the next adjacent component and continue until the whole curve is dividedinto these mid boiling point components.
Mid volume percentage point components
Sometimes the assay has been so constructed as to correlate the crude oil propertiesagainst components on a mid volume percentage basis. In using such data as this theTBP curve is divided into mid volume point components. This is easier than the midboiling point concept and requires only that the curve be divided into a number ofvolumetric sections. The mid volume ﬁgure for each of these sections is merely thearithmetic mean of the volume range of each component.
Using these deﬁnitions the determination of the product properties can proceed using
the distillation curves for the products, the pseudo component concept, and the assaydata. This is given in the following items:
Predicting TBP and ASTM curves from assay dataThe properties of products can be predicted by constructing mid boiling point com-
ponents from a TBP curve and assigning the properties to each of these components.AN INTRODUCTION TO CRUDE OIL AND ITS PROCESSING 11

These assigned properties are obtained either from the assay data, known compo-
nents of similar boiling points, or established relationships such as gravity, molecularweights, and boiling points. However, before these mid boiling points (pseudo) com-ponents can be developed it is necessary to know the shape of the product TBP curve.The following is a method by which this can be achieved. Good, Connel et al. (1)accumulated data to relate the ASTM end point to a TBP cut point over the light andmiddle distillate range of crude. Their correlation curves are given in Figure 1.3, andare self explanatory. Thrift (2) derived a probable shape of ASTM data. The proba-bility graph that he developed is given as Figure 1.4. The product ASTM curve froma well designed unit would be a straight line from 0 %vol to 100 %vol on this graph.Using these two graphs it is possible now to predict the ASTM distillation curve of aproduct knowing only its TBP cut range.12 CHAPTER 1

and can be seen to compare well with laboratory results of the actual product from a
crude distillation unit.
Developing the TBP curve and the EFV curve from the ASTM distillation curve
Using a product ASTM distillation curve developed as shown above the TBP curve
is developed as follows.
Converting the product ASTM distillation to TBP
Most crude distillation units take a full range naphtha cut as the overhead product.This cut contains all the light ends, ethane through pentanes, in the crude and of coursethe heavier naphtha cut. All the light ends are in solution, therefore it is not possibleto prepare a meaningful ASTM distillation on this material directly. Two routes canbe adopted in this case, the ﬁrst is to take naphtha samples of the heavy naphtha anddebutanized light naphtha from downstream units. Alternatively the sample can besubject to light end analysis in the lab such as using POD apparatus (Podbielniak)and carrying out an ASTM distillation on the stabilized sample. It is the second routethat is chosen for this case.
There are two well-proven methods for this conversion. The ﬁrst is by Edmister (3)
and given in his book Applied Thermodynamics and the second by Maxwell (4) in his
book Data Book on Hydrocarbons. The correlation curves from both these sourcesAN INTRODUCTION TO CRUDE OIL AND ITS PROCESSING 15

will be used.
The ASTM distillation is tabulated as the temperature for IBP , 10%, 20% through
to the FBP . IBP is the Initial Boiling Point (equivalent to 0% over) and the FBP isthe Final Boiling Point (equivalent to 100% vol over). The multiples of 10% reﬂectthe volume distilled and the temperature at which each increment is distilled. UsingFigure 1.6 the 50% vol TBP point (in degrees Fahrenheit) is calculated from the 50%vol point of the ASTM distillation.16 CHAPTER 1

Figure 1.6 is then used to determine the TBP temperature difference from the ASTM
temperature difference for the 0–10% vol, 10–30% vol, 30–50% vol, 50–70% vol,70–90% vol, and 90–100% vol. Moving from the established 50% vol TBP ﬁgure andusing the temperature differences given by Figure 1.6 the TBP temperatures at 0, 10,30, 50, 70, 90, and 100% vol are obtained (Table 1.2).
Developing the equilibrium ﬂash vaporization curve"
"The Maxwell curves given as Figure 1.7 are used to develop the equilibrium ﬂashvaporization curve (EFV) from the TBP . The EFV curve gives the temperature atwhich a required volume of distillate will be vaporized. This distillate vapor is alwaysin equilibrium with its liquid residue. The development of the EFV curve is alwaysat atmospheric pressure. Other temperature and pressure related conditions may bedetermined using the vapor pressure curves or constructing a phase diagram.
The TBP reference line (DRL) is ﬁrst drawn by a straight line through the 10% vol
point and the 70% vol point on the TBP curve. The slope of this line is determinedas temperature difference per volume percent. This data are then used to determinethe 50% volume temperature of a ﬂash reference line (FRL). The curve in Figure 1.7relating /Delta1t
50(DRL–FRL) to DRL slope is used for this. Finally, the curve on Figure 1.7
relating the ratio of temperature differences between the FRL and ﬂash curve (EFV)from that for the TBP to DRL is applied to each percent volume. From this theatmospheric EFV curve is drawn.
A sample calculation for the compilation of the EFV curve follows. Note the TBP
curve is used to deﬁne product yields while the EFV curve is used to deﬁne tempera-ture/pressure conditions in distillation. This example uses the TBP curve developedabove as a starting point (Table 1.3).
The resulting TBP curves and EFV curves are shown in Figure 1.8.18 CHAPTER 1

Predicting product qualities
The following paragraphs describe the prediction of product properties using pseudo
components (mid boiling point) and assay data. A diesel cut with TBP cut points 432◦F
to 595◦F on Kuwait crude (Figure 1.9) will be used to illustrate these calculations. The
actual TBP of this cut is predicted using the method already described. The curve isthen divided into about six pseudo mid boiling point components as described earlierand is shown as Figure 1.10.
Predicting the gravity of the product
Using the mid boiling point versus speciﬁc gravity curve from the assay given in
the Appendix, the SG for each component is obtained. The weight factor for eachcomponent is then obtained by multiplying the volume percent of that component bythe speciﬁc gravity. The sum of the weight factors divided by the 100% volume totalis the speciﬁc gravity of the gas oil cut. This is shown in Table 1.4.
The prediction of product sulfur content
The prediction of sulfur content is similar to the method used for gravity. First the TBP
curve for the product is determined and split into pseudo boiling point components.The weight factor is then determined for each component as before. Note that sulfurcontent is always quoted as a percent weight. Using the relationship of percent sulfurto mid boiling point given in the assay the sulfur content of each component is readoff. This is multiplied by the weight factor for each component to give a sulfur factor.The sum of the total sulfur factors divided by the total weight factor gives the weightpercent sulfur content of the fraction. For example, using the same gas oil cut asbefore its sulfur content is determined as shown in Table 1.5.AN INTRODUCTION TO CRUDE OIL AND ITS PROCESSING 19

indices do not warrant this. These properties are therefore read off directly from the
mid boiling point of the whole product. Considering the gas oil used in the previousexample, its mid boiling point is about 510
◦F , from the crude assay its pour point
is−5◦F and cloud point is +4◦F . Determining pour point for a blend of two or
more products is rather more difﬁcult. In this case blending indices are used for thispurpose. A graph of these indices is given as Figure 1.12. It is self explanatory andits application is explained in Table 1.7.
Flash pointsThe ﬂash point of a product is related to its ASTM distillation by the expression:
ﬂash point =0.77(ASTM 5% in
◦F–150◦F)
Thus for the gas oil product in the above the example the ﬂash point will be:
ﬂash point =0.77(420 −150)=208◦F.

Blending products of different ﬂash points
As with pour points and viscosity, the ﬂash point of a blend of two or more components
is determined by using a ﬂash blending index. Figure 1.13 gives these indices. Againthe indices are blended linearly as in the case of viscosity. Consider the followingexample:
2,000 BPSD of Kerosene with a ﬂash point of 120
◦F is to be blended with 8,000
BPSD of fuel oil with a ﬂash point of 250◦F . Calculate the ﬂash point of the blend
(Table 1.8).
Predicting the mole weights of products
The prediction of molecular weights of product streams is more often required for
the design of the processes that are going to produce those products. There are othermore rigorous calculations that can and are used for deﬁnitive design and in buildingup computer simulation packages. The method presented here is a simple method bywhich the mole weight of a product stream can be determined from a laboratory ASTMdistillation test. The result is sufﬁciently accurate for use in reﬁnery conﬁgurationstudies and the like.
A relationship exists between the mean average boiling point of a product (commonly
designated as MEABP), the API gravity, and the molecular weight of petroleumfractions. This is shown as Figure 1.14.
Using a gas oil fraction as an example, the MEABP of the product is calculated from
its ASTM distillation in degrees Fahrenheit given below:AN INTRODUCTION TO CRUDE OIL AND ITS PROCESSING 25

Basic processes
This chapter provides an introduction to some of the most common of the processes
included in fuel oriented and nonenergy oriented reﬁneries. These processes areonly discussed here in summary form. They are treated in more detail later in thebook.28 CHAPTER 1

The processes common to most energy reﬁneries
The atmospheric crude distillation unitIn reﬁning the crude oil it is ﬁrst broken up into those raw stocks that are the basis of
the ﬁnished products. This break up of the crude is achieved by separating the oil into aseries of boiling point fractions which meet the distillation requirements and some ofthe properties of the ﬁnished products. This is accomplished in the crude distillationunits. Normally there are two units that accomplish this splitting up function: anatmospheric unit and a vacuum unit.
The crude oil ﬁrst enters the Atmospheric unit where it is desalted (dissolved brine
is removed by washing) and heated to a predetermined temperature. This is accom-plished by heat exchange with hot products and ﬁnally by a direct ﬁred heater. Thehot and partially vaporized crude is ‘Flashed’ in a trayed distillation tower. Here,the vaporized portion of the crude oil feed moves up the tower and is selectivelycondensed by cooled reﬂux streams moving down the tower. These condensates aretaken off at various parts of the tower according to their condensing temperature asdistillate side streams. The light oils not condensed in the tower are taken off at thetop of the tower to be condensed externally as the overhead product. The unvapor-ized portion of the crude oil feed leaves the bottom of the tower as the atmosphericresidue.
The unit operates at a small positive pressure around 5–10 psig in the overhead
drum, thus, its title of ‘Atmospheric’ crude unit. Typical product streams leaving thedistillation tower are as follows:
Overhead distillate Full range naphtha Gas to 380
◦F cut point
1st side stream Kerosene 380 to 480◦F cut range

The crude vacuum distillation unit
Further break up of the crude is often required to meet the reﬁnery’ s product slate. This
is usually required to produce low cost feed to cracking units or to produce the basicstocks for lubricating oil production. To achieve this the residue from the atmosphericunit is distilled under sub atmospheric conditions in the crude vacuum distillation unit.This unit operates similar to the atmospheric unit in so much as the feed is heatedby heat exchange with hot products and then in a ﬁred heater before entering thedistillation tower. In this case, however, the tower operates under reduced pressure(vacuum) conditions. These units operate at overhead pressures as low as 10 mmHg.Under these conditions the hot residue feed is partially vaporized on entering the tower.The hot vapors rise up the tower to be successively condensed by cooled internal reﬂuxstream moving down the tower as was the case in the atmospheric distillation unit.The condensed distillate streams are taken off as side stream distillates. There is nooverhead distillate stream in this case.
The high vacuum condition met with in these units is produced by a series of steam
ejectors attached to the unit’ s overhead system. Typical product streams from this unitare as follows:
Top side stream Light vacuum gas oil 690 to 750
◦F
2nd side stream Heavy vacuum gas oil 750 to 985◦F
Residue Bitumen +985◦F
This unit is further described and discussed in Chapter 3."
"The light end units
The full range naphtha distillate as the overhead product from the atmospheric crude
unit is further split into the basic components of the reﬁnery’ s volatile and light oilproducts. This is accomplished in the light end plant which usually contains fourseparate distillation units. These are:
rThe de-butanizer
rThe de-propanizer
rThe de-ethanizer
rThe naphtha splitter.
The most common routing of the full range naphtha from the atmospheric crudeoverhead is ﬁrst to the de-butanizer unit. This feed stream is heated by heat exchangewith hot products before entering the feed tray of the de-butanizer column. Thisis a distillation column containing between 30 and 40 trays. Separation of butanesand lighter gas from the naphtha occurs in this tower by fractionation. The butanesand lighter are taken off as an overhead distillate while the naphtha is removed as thecolumn’ s bottom product. The overhead distillate is then heated again by heat exchangeAN INTRODUCTION TO CRUDE OIL AND ITS PROCESSING 31
with hot streams and fed into a de-propanizer column. This column also has about
30–40 distillation trays and separates a butanes stream from the propane and lightermaterial stream by fractionation. The butanes leave as the column’ s bottom product tobecome the Butane LPG product after further ‘sweetening’ treatment (sulfur removal).The column’ s overhead distillate is fed to a de-ethanizer column after preheating. Herethe propane is separated from the lighter materials and leaves the column as the bottomproduct. This stream becomes part of the reﬁnery’ s propane LPG product after somefurther ‘sweetening’ treatment. There will be no overhead distillate product from thisunit. The material lighter than propane leaves the overhead drum as a vapor containingmostly ethane, and is normally routed to the reﬁnery’ s fuel gas system.
The de-butanized naphtha leaving the bottom of the de-butanizer is subsequently
fractionated in the naphtha splitter to give a light naphtha stream as the overheaddistillate and a heavy naphtha as the column’ s bottom product. The light naphtha isessentially C5’ s and nC6’ s, this stream is normally sent to the reﬁnery’ s gasoline poolas blending stock. The heavy naphtha stream contains the cycloparafﬁn componentsand the higher parafﬁn isomers necessary in making good catalytic reformer feed.This stream therefore is sent to the catalytic reformer after it has been hydrotreatedfor sulfur and nitrogen removal.
The Light End units are further described and discussed in Chapter 4.The catalytic reformer unitThe purpose of the catalytic reformer plant is to upgrade low octane naphtha to the
high octane material suitable for blending into motor gasoline fuel. It achieves this byreforming some of the hydrocarbons in the feed to hydrocarbons of high octane value.Notably among those reactions is the conversion of cycloparafﬁn content of the feedto aromatics. This reaction also gives up hydrogen molecules which are subsequentlyused in the reﬁnery’ s hydrotreating processes.
The feed from the bottom of the naphtha splitter is hydrotreated in the naphtha hy-
drotreater for the removal of sulfur and nitrogen. It leaves this unit to be preheatedto the reforming reaction temperature by heat exchange with products and by a ﬁredheater. The feed is mixed with a recycle hydrogen stream before entering the ﬁrst ofthree reactors. The reforming reactions take place in these reactors and the reactortemperatures are sustained and controlled by intermediate ﬁred heaters. The efﬂuentleaves the last reactor to be cooled and partially condensed by heat exchange withcold feed and a condenser. This cooled efﬂuent is routed to a ﬂash drum from whicha hydrogen rich stream is removed as a gas while the reformate is removed as a liquidstream and sent to a stabilizer column. The bottoms from this column is de butanizedreformate and is routed to the gasoline pool for blending to meet motor gasolinespeciﬁcations. Part of the gas leaving the ﬂash drum is recycled to the reactors as the32 CHAPTER 1
unit’ s recycle stream. The remaining gas is normally sent to the naphtha hydrotreater
for use in that process.
Details of the catalytic reforming process are described and discussed further in
Chapter 5.
The hydrotreating units (de-sulfurization)
Most streams from the crude distillation units contain sulfur and other impurities
such as nitrogen, and metals in some form or other. By far the most common ofthese impurities is sulfur, and this is also the least tolerable of these impurities. Itspresence certainly lowers the quality of the ﬁnished products and in the processing ofthe crude oil its presence invariably affects the performance of the reﬁning processes.Hydrotreating the raw distillate streams removes a signiﬁcant amount of the sulfurimpurity by reacting the sulfur molecule with hydrogen to form hydrogen sulﬁde(H
2S) this is then removed as a gas."
"Two types of de sulfurizing hydrotreaters are presented in this book. These are:
rNaphtha hydrotreating—Once through hydrogen
rDiesel hydrotreating—Recycle hydrogen
In naphtha hydro treating the naphtha from the naphtha splitter is mixed with thehydrogen rich gas from the catalytic reformer unit and preheated to about 700
◦Fb y
heat exchange and a ﬁred heater. On leaving the ﬁred heater the stream enters a reactorcontaining a de-sulfurizing catalyst (usually a Co Mo on alumina base). The sulfurcomponents of the feed combine with the hydrogen to form H
2S. The efﬂuent from the
reactors are cooled and partially condensed before being ﬂashed in a separator drum.The gas phase from this drum is still high in hydrogen content and is usually routedto other down stream hydrogen user processes. This stream contains most of the H
2S
produced in the reactors, the remainder leaves the ﬂash drum with the de-sulfurizednaphtha liquid to be removed in the hydrotreater’ s stabilizer column as a H
2S rich gas.
Diesel hydrotreating has very much the same process conﬁguration as the naphthaunit. The main difference is that this unit will almost invariably have a rich hydrogenstream recycle. The recycle is provided by the ﬂashed gas stream from the ﬂash drum.This is returned to mix with the feed and a fresh hydrogen make up stream beforeentering the preheater system. The recycle gas stream in these units is often treatedfor the removal of H
2S before returning to the reactors.
A detailed discussion and description of these processes are given in Chapter 8.AN INTRODUCTION TO CRUDE OIL AND ITS PROCESSING 33
The ﬂuid catalytic cracking unit
This cracking process is among the oldest in the oil industry. Although developed
in the mid 1920s it ﬁrst came into prominence during the Second World War as asource of high octane fuel for aircraft. In the early ﬁfties its prominence as the majorsource of octane was somewhat overshadowed by the development of the catalyticreforming process with its production of hydrogen as well as high octane material.The prominence of the ﬂuid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) was reestablished in the1960s by two developments in the process. These were:
rThe use of highly active and selective catalysts (Zeolites)
rThe establishment of riser cracking techniques
These two developments enabled the process to produce higher yields of better qualitydistillates from lower quality feed stocks. At the same time catalyst inventory andconsumption costs were signiﬁcantly reduced.
The process consists of a reactor vessel and a regenerator vessel interconnected by
transfer lines to enable the ﬂow of ﬁnely divided catalyst powder between them. Theoil feed (typically HVGO from the crude vacuum unit) is introduced to the very hotregenerated catalyst stream leaving the regenerator on route to the reactor. Crackingoccurs in the riser inlet to the reactor due to the contact of the oil with the hot catalyst.The catalyst and oil are very dispersed in the riser so that contact between them is veryhigh exposing a large portion of the oil to the hot catalyst. The cracking is completed inthe catalyst ﬂuid bed in the reactor vessel. The catalyst ﬂuidity is maintained by steaminjection at the bottom of the vessel. The cracked efﬂuent leaves the top of the reactorvessel as a vapor to enter the recovery section of the plant. Here the distillate productsof cracking are separated by fractionation and forwarded to storage or further treating.An oil slurry stream from this recovery plant is returned to the reactor as recycle.
The catalyst from the reactor is transferred to the regenerator on a continuous basis.
In the regenerator the catalyst is contacted with an air stream which maintains thecatalyst in a ﬂuidized state. The hot carbon on the catalyst is burned off by contactwith the air and converted into CO and CO
2. The reactions are highly exothermic
rising the temperature of the catalyst stream to well over 1,000◦F and thus providing
the heat source for the oil cracking mechanism.
Products from this process are:
rUnsaturated and saturated LPG
rLight cracked naphtha
rHeavy cracked naphtha
rCycle oil (mid distillate)
rslurry.34 CHAPTER 1
Details of this process together with typical yield data are given in Chapters 6 and 11.
The hydrocracking process
This process is fairly new to the industry becoming prominent in its use during the"
"late 1960s. As the title suggests the process cracks the oil feed in the presence ofhydrogen. It is a high pressure process operating normally around 2,000 psig. Thismakes the unit rather costly and because of this has diminished its prominence inthe industry compared with the FCCU and thermal cracking. However, the process isvery ﬂexible. It can handle a wide spectrum of feeds including straight run gas oils,vacuum gas oils, thermal cracker gas oils, FCCU cycle oils and the like. The products itproduces need very little down stream treating to meet ﬁnished product speciﬁcations.The naphtha stream it produces is particularly high in naphthenes making it a goodcatalytic reformer stock for gasoline or aromatic production.
The process consists of one or two reactors, a preheat system, recycle gas section,
and a recovery section. The oil feed (typically a vacuum gas oil) is preheated by heatexchange with reactor efﬂuent streams and by a ﬁred heater. Make up and recyclehydrogen streams are introduced into the oil stream before entering the reactor(s).(Note in some conﬁgurations the gas streams are also preheated prior to joining theoil). The ﬁrst section of the reactor is often packed with a de-sulfurizing catalyst toprotect the more sensitive cracking catalyst further down in the reactor from injurioussulfur, nitrogen, and metal poisoning. Cracking occurs in the reactor(s) and the efﬂuentleaves the reactor to be cooled and partially condensed by heat exchange. The streamenters the ﬁrst of two ﬂash drums. Here, the drum pressure is almost that of the reactor.A gas stream rich in hydrogen is ﬂashed off and is recycled back to the reactors asrecycle gas. The liquid phase from the ﬂash drum is routed to a second separatorwhich is maintained at a much lower pressure (around 150–100 psig). Because of thisreduction in pressure a second gas stream is ﬂashed off. This will have a much lowerhydrogen content but will contain C3’ s and C4’ s. For this reason the stream is oftenrouted to an absorber column for maximizing LPG recovery. The liquid phase leavesthe bottom of the low-pressure absorber to enter the recovery side where products areseparated by fractionation and sent to storage.
Further details of this process are given in Chapters 7 and 11.
Thermal cracking units
Thermal cracking processes are the true work horses of the oil reﬁning industry.
The processes are relatively cheap when compared with the ﬂuid cracker and thehydrocracker but go a long way to achieving the heavy oil cracking objective ofAN INTRODUCTION TO CRUDE OIL AND ITS PROCESSING 35
converting low quality material into more valuable oil products. The process family
of Thermal Crackers has three members, which are:
rThermal crackers
rVisbreakers
rCokers.
The term Thermal Cracking is given to those processes that convert heavy oil (usuallyfuel oil or residues) into lighter product stock such as LPG, naphtha, and middledistillates by applying only heat to the feed over a prescribed element of time. The termThermal Cracker when applied to a speciﬁc process usually refers to the processing ofatmospheric residues (long residue) to give the lighter products. The term visbreakingrefers to the processing of vacuum residues (short residues) to reduce the viscosityof the oil only and thus to meet the requirements of a more valuable fuel oil stock.Coking refers to the most severe process in the Thermal Cracking family. Eitherlong or short residues can be feed to this process who’ s objective is to producethe lighter distillate products and oil coke only. The coker process is extinctive—that is it converts ALL the feed. In the other two processes there is usually someunconverted feed although the Thermal Cracker can be designed to be ‘extinctive’ byrecycling the unconverted oil. The three Thermal cracking processes have the samebasic process conﬁguration. This consists of a cracking furnace, a ‘soaking’ vesselor coil, and a product recovery fractionator(s). The feed is ﬁrst preheated by heatexchange with hot product streams before entering the cracking furnace or heater.The cracking furnace raises the temperature of the oil to its predetermined crackingtemperature. This is always in excess of 920
◦F and by careful design of the heater
coils the oil is retained in the furnace at a prescribed cracking temperature for apredetermined period of time (the residence time). In some cases an additional coilsection is added to the heater to allow the oil to ‘soak’ at the ﬁxed temperature for alonger period of time. In other cases the oil leaves the furnace to enter a drum whichretains the oil at its cracking temperature for a little time. In the Coker process theoil leaves the furnace to enter one of a series of Coker drums in which the oil isretained for a longer period of time at its coking temperature for the production ofcoke.
The cracked oil is quenched by a cold heavy oil product stream on leaving the soaking"
"section to a temperature below its cracking temperature. It then enters a fractionatorwhere the distillate products are separated and taken off in a manner similar to thecrude distillation unit. In the case of the cokers the coke is removed from the drumsby high velocity water jets on a regular batch basis. The coking process summarizedhere refers to the more simple ‘Delayed Coking’ process. There are other cokingprocesses which are more complicated such as the ﬂuid coker and the proprietary Flexicoker.36 CHAPTER 1
Further details on Thermal Cracking are provided in Chapter 11. This chapter includes
also the treating of residues by hydrocracking and ﬂuid catalytic cracking.
Gas treating processesThe processes summarized above are the more common to be included in a fuel or
energy reﬁnery’ s conﬁguration. In addition to these there will also be the gas treatingprocesses and often sulfur recovery processes. These are described and discussed inChapter 10.
Gas treating is always required to remove the H
2S impurity generated by hydrotreating
or cracking from the reﬁnery fuel gas or hydrogen recycle streams. The removal of H 2S
for these purposes is accomplished by absorbing the hydrogen sulﬁde into an amine
or similar solution that readily absorbs H 2S. Stripping the rich absorbent solution
removes the H 2S from the system to be further reacted with air to produce elemental
sulfur. This latter reaction takes place in specially designed sulfur plant.
The rich H 2S laden gases from all the reﬁnery sources enters below the bottom tray
(or packed bed) of the absorber tower. The lean H 2S free absorbent solution enters the
tower above the top tray (or packed bed) to move down the tower counter current to the
gas moving upwards. Mixing on the trays (or packed beds) allows the H 2S from the gas
phase to be absorbed into the liquid solution phase. The H 2S free gas leaves the tower
top to be routed to reﬁnery fuel or other prescribed destination.
The rich absorbent solution leaves the bottom of the absorber to be heat exchanged
with hot stripped absorbent solution before entering the feed tray of the Strippingcolumn. The solution moving down the tower is stripped free of H
2S by a stripper
vapor phase moving up the tower. This stripper phase is generated by conventionalreboiling of the bottom tray solution. The hot stripped solution leaves the bottom ofthe tower to be cooled by heat exchange with the feed and then by an air or water coolerbefore entering the absorber tower. Conditions in the stripper column is maintainedby partially condensing the rich H
2S overhead vapors. Then returning the distillate
as reﬂux to the top tray of the rectifying section of the tower (which is the section oftrays above the feed tray).
The vapor not condensed leaves the reﬂux drum to be routed to a sulfur plant. These
vapors contain a high concentration of H
2S (usually in excess of 90% mol) and enter
the specially designed fuel ‘gun’ of the sulfur plant heater. Here, about one third ismixed with an appropriate concentration of air and ‘burned’ in the plant’ s ﬁre box togenerate SO
2. The gases generated are combined with the remaining H 2S and passed
over a catalyst bed where almost complete conversion to elemental sulfur occurs. Thisproduct, in molten form, enters a heated storage pit. The unconverted sulfurous vaporsAN INTRODUCTION TO CRUDE OIL AND ITS PROCESSING 37
are further incinerated before venting to atmosphere from an acceptably elevated
location.
Processes not so common to energy reﬁneries
Octane enhancement processesThe octane enhancement processes detailed in this book are the alkylation process and
the isomerization process. These processes are usually proprietary and are providedto reﬁners under license.
The alkylation process treated here is the HF process which utilizes hydrogen ﬂuoride
as the catalyst which is used to convert unsaturated C4’ s to high octane isobutanes. Theunit ’ s recovery side is the aspect dealt with in some detail together with a descriptiveitem on the safe handling of hydrogen ﬂuoride.
The isomerization process has a similar conﬁguration to the catalytic reformer plant.
This process uses hydrogen in its conversion of low octane hydrocarbons to the highoctane isomers.
Both these processes are described and discussed in detail in Chapter 9.
Oxygenated gasolines
The concentration of vehicles on the roads in most of the cities in the modern world
has increased dramatically over the last two decades. The emission of pollutants fromthese vehicles is causing a signiﬁcant addition to the already critical problem ofatmospheric pollution. The problem is now so acute that governments of most ﬁrstworld countries are seeking legislation to curb and minimize this pollution and mostcountries will see the implementation of ‘Clean Air’ acts in the 21st century.
Petroleum reﬁning companies have been working diligently for many years to satisfy"
"the requirements of ‘Clean Air’ legislation already in place. This began in the 1970swith the elimination of tetra ethyl lead from most gasoline requirements. Processessuch as isomerization and polymerization of reﬁnery streams were developed togetherwith a surge in the use of the alkylation process. However, the further decrease ofpollutants now requires a move away from the traditional gasoline octane enhancerssuch as the aromatics and the oleﬁns.
Catalytic reforming produces gasoline streams to meet octane requirements mainly
by converting cycloparafﬁn to light aromatics. Fluid catalytic cracking also producesgasoline blending stocks by cracking parafﬁns to light oleﬁns and the products from38 CHAPTER 1
these two processes still make up the bulk of a reﬁnery’ s gasoline pool. Unfortu-
nately the aromatics are ‘Dirty Compounds’ because they produce a sooty exhaustemission—unacceptable in meeting the ‘Clean Air’ requirements. Considerable workhas been done with alcohol to take the place of aromatics and as octane enhancersand meeting other gasoline specs such as RVP . The work has had some success andsome companies in North America use ethanol in the gasoline blend.
The greatest success in reducing aromatics in gasoline to date however has been in the
production and blending of oxygenated compounds into the gasoline pool. A pressrelease by a number of companies in 1,990 is quoted as follows:
rAdding oxygenates reduces the amount of exhaust emissions (hydrocarbons andcarbon monoxide) and the beneﬁts have been quantiﬁed.
rChanging the level of oleﬁns in gasoline does not have much of an impact on vehicleexhaust emission.
rReducing aromatics and/or boiling range of gasoline can either reduce or increaseexhaust emissions depending upon vehicle type.
Oxygenates are ether compounds derived from their respective alcohol. There arethree candidates of these ethers to meet the gasoline requirements. These are:
rMethyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE)
rEthyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE)
rTertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME).
Of these three candidates MTBE is the one that has been used more extensively tomeet all the gasoline pool objectives. This compound has the blending quality of 109octane, a RVP blending of 8–10 psi and a boiling point of 131
◦F.
ETBE octane blending properties seem to be slightly better than those of MTBE andso does its RVP blending qualities. The ethanol feed stream of course is not so readilyavailable as methanol.
TAME has an average octane number of 104, and a RVP blending of 3–5 psi. Except
for the lower octane value TAME has similar blending properties to ETBE. The etherin this case is formed by the reaction of 2-methyl-2-butene and 2-methyl-1-buteneoleﬁn feed and methanol. Commercial plants operate in the UK and parts of Europeproducing TAME. The compound is used in Europe as a gasoline product and notas a gasoline blend stock. The front end of a cracked gasoline stream is used in thismanufacture to provide the oleﬁn.
Use of MTBE has been phased out in the U.S. because of ground water contamination
but is still in use in Europe and elsewhere. However, emphasis on the use of renewableresources in Europe has prompted a gradual shift from MTBE to ETBE.AN INTRODUCTION TO CRUDE OIL AND ITS PROCESSING 39
Figure 1.15. Typical ﬂow diagram for the production of MTBE.
The production of the ethers
There are several licensed processes for the production of methyl tertiary butyl ether
by the etheriﬁcation of a C4/C5 oleﬁn stream and methanol. These processes havevery similar conﬁgurations and are ﬂexible enough to be converted quite simply to theproduction of the other ethers. Figure 1.15 is a typical ﬂow diagram for this process.
The oleﬁn feed from a FCCU or a steam cracker is combined with a methanol stream
to enter a guard reactor to remove impurities. A small hydrogen stream is added to thehydrocarbon from the guard reactor prior to entering the ether reactor. This reactorcontains special resin catalyst and the reactor feed ﬂows upward through this catalystbed at moderate temperature and pressure and in the liquid phase. The reaction isexothermic and temperature control is maintained by externally cooling a recyclestream from the ﬁrst of two reactor vessels.40 CHAPTER 1
The catalyst in this case performs three reactions simultaneously: Etheriﬁcation
of branched oleﬁns, selective hydrogenation of the unwanted di-oleﬁns, and hydroisomerization of oleﬁn by a double bond switch. The reactor efﬂuent leaves the top ofthe second reactor vessel to be heated in a feed heat exchanger with the de-butanizerbottoms product. The overheads from the de-butanizer is a C4 and methanol stream.The methanol stream is recycled to the ﬁrst reactor while the C4s are returned to theFCCU light ends unit. The bottom product is C5+ enriched with MTBE (or TAME
depending on the oleﬁn feed used).
The production of Oxygenated gasolines is described and discussed in further detail
in Chapter 9.
The non-energy reﬁneries"
"In addition to the energy related reﬁneries, which occupy most of this book, there are
two major nonenergy producing reﬁneries. These are, the lube oil reﬁnery, and thepetrochemical reﬁneries. These are summarized below:
The lube oil reﬁnery
The schematic ﬂow diagram (Figure 1.16) shows a typical lube oil producing reﬁn-
ery conﬁguration. Only about 8 or 9 base lube oil stocks are produced from reﬁnerystreams. The many hundreds of commercial grades of lubricating oils used in industryand transportation are blends of these base stocks with some small amounts of pro-prietary additives (mostly organic acid derivatives) included to meet their requiredspeciﬁcations. There are also two quite important bye products to lube oil. Theseare bitumen and waxes. Most reﬁneries include bitumen blending in their conﬁgura-tion, but only a few of the older reﬁneries process the waxes. These are exported tomanufacturers specializing in wax and grease production.
Lube oil production starts with the vacuum distillation of atmospheric residue. This
feedstock is usually cut into three distillate streams each meeting a boiling range whichgives streams with viscosity meeting the ﬁnished blending product speciﬁcations. Thelighter stream is taken off as the top side stream and is further distilled again undervacuum to three light lube oil blending cuts. These are called spindle oils and whenﬁnished will form the basis of light lubes used for domestic purposes such as sewingmachine, bicycle, and other home lubricant requirements. Some of the heavier spindleoils are also used as blend stocks for light motor oils. These spindle oils require verylittle treatment for ﬁnishing. Usually, a mild hydrotreating sufﬁces to meet colorrequirement.AN INTRODUCTION TO CRUDE OIL AND ITS PROCESSING 41

The second distillate side stream is dewaxed and sent to the engine lube oil pool. It
may also be blended with the heavier bottom side stream as heavy engine oil stock.The bottom side stream is one of the base blending stock for heavy engine oils andthe turbine oil stocks. To meet color and other speciﬁcations these heavier oils mustbe treated for the removal of undesirable components (such as heavy aromatics andoleﬁns) by solvent extraction. This is accomplished prior to the stream being de-waxed and routed to storage. The heavy vacuum residue from the vacuum tower isrouted to a propane de-asphalting unit. Here, the very thick bituminous asphaltenes42 CHAPTER 1
are removed by extraction with liquid propane. The rafﬁnate from this extraction
process is the heaviest lube oil blending stream commonly called Bright stock. Thisstream is also routed to the solvent extraction unit and the de waxing process beforestorage.
Solvent extraction is accomplished in a trayed column by contacting the oil feed and
solvent counter currently in the tower. The lighter rafﬁnate stream leaves the top ofthe tower to be stripped free of the solvent in an associated stripper column, beforeentering the de waxing unit. The extracted components leave the bottom of the toweralso to be stripped free of the solvent in an associated stripper column. The extractin this case may be routed to the propane de asphalting unit or simply sent to thereﬁnery fuel supply. The solvent in modern reﬁneries is either Fufural, Phenol, ora proprietary solvent based on either of these chemicals. In earlier plants Oleum orliquid SO
2was used for this purpose.
The oil streams routed to the de waxing plant are contacted and mixed with a crystal-lizing agent such as Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK) before entering a series of chillertubes. Here the oil/MEK mix is reduced in temperature to a degree that the waxcontained in the oil crystallizes out. The stream with the wax now in suspensionenter a series of drum ﬁlters where the wax and oil are separated. Both streams arestripped free of the MEK in separate columns. The MEK is recycled while the dewaxed oil is sent to storage and blending. The wax may be retained as a solid in asuitably furnished warehouse or re melted and stored in special tanks with inert gascover.
The asphalt from the propane de-asphalting unit is stripped free of propane and any"
"other light ends using inert gas as the stripping agent. It leaves the unit to proceed eitherdirectly to the bitumen pool or to be further treated by air blowing. The air blowingprocess increases the hardness of the bitumen where this is required to meet certainspeciﬁcations. It is accomplished either as a batch process or on a continuous basis.The hot stripped asphalt from the de asphalting unit enters the air blower reactor underlevel control (if the process is continuous). Air is introduced via a small compressorto the bottom of the reactor vessel, and allowed to bubble up through the hot oil phase.The air removes some of the heavy entrained oils in the asphalt and reacts mildly topartially oxidize the asphaltenes. The hot oil vapors and the unused air leaves thetop of the reactor to be burned in a suitably designed incinerator. The blown asphaltleaves the reactor as a side stream to bitumen storage or blending.
The production of lube oils usually takes place in a section of an energy reﬁnery.
The various grades of the oils are also produced in a blocked operation using storagefacilities between the units. This is feasible as the amount of lube oils required to beproduced are relatively small and normally do not justify separate treating facilitiesfor each grade.AN INTRODUCTION TO CRUDE OIL AND ITS PROCESSING 43
The lube oil reﬁnery is further detailed in Chapter 12.
The petrochemical reﬁnery
Feed stocks for the production of petrochemicals originate from reﬁneries with pro-
cesses similar to those described in this book producing fuels. Indeed there are only afew reﬁneries world wide that cater only for petrochemical requirements. Most petro-chemical feed stocks are produced by changing operating parameters of the normalfuel reﬁnery processes. In catering for the petrochemical needs much of the reﬁneryproduct streams are tailored as follows:
rAromatic streams—High in benzene, toluene, xylenes
rOleﬁn streams—High in ethylene, propylene and C4s.
Producing the aromatic feed stockThe production of aromatics feed stocks originates with the catalytic reforming of areﬁnery stream of a heavy naphtha range (say 120
◦–420◦F) and rich in naphthenes. A
typical stream that meets this criteria would be a naphtha stream from a hydrocracker.Thus in meeting this petrochemical, needs a hydrocracker forming part of a fuelreﬁnery conﬁguration. This unit would be operated to maximize naphtha production.This would mean running the unit on a low space velocity with a higher oil recyclerate (that is most recovered product heavier than the naphtha would be recycled backto the reactors).
Another source of high naphthene feed to the cat reformer would be hydrotreated cat
cracker naphtha. Of course the hydrotreating of unsaturates has a high demand onthe reﬁnery’ s hydrogen system, but this is balanced to some extent by the additionalhydrogen produced in reforming the naphthenes. Should the reﬁnery conﬁgurationinclude a thermal cracker and/or a steam cracker the hydrotreating of the naphtha cutfrom these units also yield high naphthene catalytic reformer feed stock.
Catalytic reforming of the high naphthene content naphtha produces aromatics but
there is also present some unreacted parafﬁns and some naphthenes. The down streampetrochemical units that separate and purify the aromatic reformate are expensive bothin capital and operating costs. The speciﬁcation for the BTX (Benzene, Toluene, Xy-lene) feed therefore is very stringent and excludes non aromatic components as muchas possible. Another process may therefore be included in the reﬁnery conﬁgurationto ‘clean up’ this aromatic feed stream before leaving the reﬁnery. This is an aromaticextraction plant. This is a licensed process using a solvent to separate the parafﬁns andaromatics by counter current extraction. The rich aromatic stream is then forwardedto the BTX plant where benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and o-xylene, are separated
by fractionation while the para-xylene is usually separated by crystallization. The44 CHAPTER 1
Figure 1.17. A petrochemical reﬁnery conﬁguration.
meta-xylene may also be recovered by super distillation but more often than not it is
converted into o-xylene in an isomerization unit.
Producing the oleﬁn feed stockThe source of oleﬁns in a reﬁnery conﬁguration is from either the FCCU, a thermalcracker, or a steam cracker. The oleﬁns produced as a gas are ethylene, propylene,and the C4’ s such as butylenes, butadiene etc. Liquid oleﬁnic products from theseunits are normally hydrotreated to make reformer feedstock and thus the BTX feed.All products of course are treated for sulfur control and clean up before leavingthe reﬁnery as petrochemical feed stock. The speciﬁcations for these products arestringent and usually the ‘clean up’ plants are dedicated to the treatment of theseproducts.
Oleﬁns are used mostly in the production of polymers such as the vinyl polymers (vinyl"
"chloride, vinyl acetate and the like), the poly ethylene products, and the polypropyleneproducts. The heavier C4’ s are a major constituent in the production of syntheticrubbers. Figure 1.17 shows a conﬁguration for a typical petrochemical reﬁnery.
The petrochemical reﬁnery is also further described and discussed in Chapter 12.AN INTRODUCTION TO CRUDE OIL AND ITS PROCESSING 45

2.1 Introduction
This chapter deﬁnes the major products normally produced from the reﬁning of crude
oil. These products are the intermediary and ﬁnished products from energy reﬁneriesonly. Chapter 1 of this book provided brief description of the products, this chapterexpands on this with a more in-depth look at the products themselves. Their demandin the petroleum markets and also the environmental impact of the more prominentproducts are discussed in this chapter. Finally the chapter continues with an exampleof the development of a process conﬁguration of the reﬁnery to meet a particularproduct slate.
The ﬁrst part of this chapter describes the basic fractions obtained from the atmo-
spheric and vacuum crude distillation units. It continues with the description of prod-ucts from the most common intermediate processes met with in many reﬁneries tomeet their various product requirements. This part of the chapter continues with anoutline of the speciﬁcations for various ﬁnished petroleum products and discussestheir salient points.
The second part of the chapter discusses the features of the motive fuels. It continues
with the effect of environmental constraints and the development of changes in thecontent of these products.
The third part describes the development of a reﬁnery’ s process conﬁguration and
discusses its purpose. The development of a reﬁnery conﬁguration is illustrated byan example. This example is compiled manually. In modern development practicehowever this would be accomplished by reducing the various product properties andtheir relationship to linear equations and solving these with high speed computers, aprocess called Linear Programming.

2.2 Petroleum products
Fractions from the atmospheric and vacuum distillation of crude oilThe most common fractions distilled from crude oil distillation processes are shown
in Figure 2.1.
These cut lengths will vary slightly depending on the crude oil source and the ﬁn-
ished product slate requirements. These are the basic components which after furtherprocessing and blending will make the ﬁnished products in composition and quantityrequired by the reﬁnery. The cuts shown in Figure 2.1 are called ‘straight run’ productsand these are described in the following paragraphs. The crude source, in this case isa medium Middle Eastern with a gravity of 33.9
◦API and a sulfur content of 1.9 %wt.
Atmospheric overhead distillate. This is not strictly a cut but consists of all the light
material in the crude absorbed into the total overhead distillate from the crude tower.This distillate, and in most cases, together with similar distillates from other processesform the feed to the reﬁnery’ s light end unit (see Chapter 4). It is in the light endunit that the straight run LPG, light naphtha, and the Heavy Naphtha are separated.However, the end point of the heavy naphtha is determined by the cut point of theoverhead distillate and the fractionation between it and the ﬁrst side stream productfrom the atmospheric unit.
Reﬁnery gas and the LPGs. In many reﬁneries most of the C
4’ s and lighter are removed
from the atmospheric column overhead distillate in the ﬁrst column of the light end
unit. This is the unit’ s debutanizer column. Some reﬁneries however chose to separatethe light naphtha and lighter from the heavy naphtha ﬁrst. There is no speciﬁc reasonone can assume its really a question of the speciﬁc reﬁnery’ s economic criteria. Havingseparated the C
4’ s and lighter as a distillate from the naphtha the distillate enters a
depropanizer where C 3and lighter are separated as a distillate from the C 4’ s. This
distillate is further fractionated in a deethanizer column where the C 3is removed as
the bottom product. There is no distillate product from this unit but all the gas lighterthan C
3leaves the tower as a vapor usually routed to the reﬁnery fuel gas system
(see Chapter 10).
The C 4portion of the overhead distillate is fractionated in the debutanizer so that it
meets ﬁnished product speciﬁcation with respect to its C 5content. The fractionation in
the depropanizer will be such that the C 3content of the bottom product—C 4LPG will"
"meet the butane LPG speciﬁcation with respect to RVP (Reid Vapor Pressure). The
fractionation in this tower will also be such that the C 4content in the overhead distillate
will meet the propane LPG speciﬁcation which leaves as the bottom product from thePETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND A REFINER Y CONFIGURATION 49

deethanizer with respect to its C 4content. The fractionation in the de-ethanizer will
be such as to ensure that the C 2and lighter content of the propane LPG will be such
as to meet that LPG’ s Reid Vapor Pressure speciﬁcation.
The naphthas. There are usually two naphtha cuts produced from most crude. These
are:
rLight naphtha (sometimes called light gasoline)
rHeavy naphtha.
Both these streams are the bottom product of the debutanizer unit. They are separated
in a naphtha splitter fractionation tower. The light naphtha contains most of the crude’ sC
5’ s and much of the parafﬁn portion of the crude’ s C 6’ s. The purpose of making such
a division is to produce a satisfactory heavy naphtha which will contain the heaviernaphthenes and will be a suitable feed for a catalytic reformer (see Chapter 14).
The light naphtha has a TBP distillation range of C
5to around 190◦F . The heavy
naphtha as the feed to the catalytic reformer and is a cut on crude of about 190◦–360◦F.
This cut point of 360◦F can vary depending on the severity operation of the catalytic
reformer, the volatility speciﬁcation of the ﬁnished gasoline which the reformate will
be a major precursor, and the reﬁneries production requirements. In this latter casefor example the reﬁnery’ s operating plan may call for maximizing kerosene in whichcase the atmospheric distillation unit would be operated to decrease the amount ofoverhead distillate in order to increase the kerosene (top side stream) fraction. Ofcourse if the reﬁnery plan is to maximize gasoline the atmospheric tower would beoperated to increase the overhead distillate at the expense of the Kero fraction.
Straight run kerosene. This fraction is usually the ﬁrst side stream of a conventional
atmospheric distillation unit. It may be cut to meet a burning oil speciﬁcation or
become a component in Jet Fuel ﬁnished product. Its cut range is usually between360
◦F and 480◦F . Again this cut range may vary with the required heavy end of the
naphtha and the front end of the Gas Oils. In most cases this Kero fraction must meeta ﬂash point speciﬁcation after it has been steam stripped, and its end cut point isusually set to meet a smoke point speciﬁcation. Usually the sulfur content restrictionis met by hydro-desulfurization, in some cases too the smoke point is reduced byother processes. These subsequent processes are aimed at removing or converting thearomatic content of the fraction. It can also be routed to the Gas oil pool as a precursorfor a diesel ﬁnished product.
The atmospheric straight run gas oils. Usually there will be two gas oil side streams, a
light gas oil side stream and below this take off a heavy gas oil side stream is withdrawn.
Both these side—streams are steam stripped to meet their respective ﬂash point spec-iﬁcation (usually 150
◦F minimum). The lighter side stream (cut of about 480–610◦F
on crude) is the principle precursor for the automotive diesel grade ﬁnished product.PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND A REFINER Y CONFIGURATION 51
This side stream is desulfurized to meet the diesel sulfur speciﬁcation in a hydro-
treater (see Chapter 8). The lower gas oil stream is really a guard stream to correctthe diesel distillation end point. This heavy gas oil may also be hydro-desulfurizedand routed to either the fuel oil pool (as a precursor for marine diesel for example) orto a ﬁnished heating oil product from the gas oil pool.
The atmospheric residue. This is the bottom product from the atmospheric distillation
of the crude oil. Most crude oils are distilled in the atmospheric crude oil tower to cut
the atmospheric residue at a +650
◦Fu pt oa+680◦F cut point. Cutting the residue
heavier than +680◦F risks the possibility of cracking with heavier coke lay down
and discoloring of the distillate products. Those atmospheric crude towers that dooperate at higher cut points minimize the cracking by the recycle of cold quench intothe bottom of the tower (below the bottom stripping tray) and minimizing the residuehold up time in the tower. The atmospheric residue may be routed to the fuel oil poolas the precursor to several grades of ﬁnished fuel oil products. The other options forthis stream in a modern reﬁnery are as follows:"
"rfeed to a vacuum distillation unit. (This is the most common option.)
rfeed to a thermal cracker (Visbreaker, or coking unit). See Chapter 11.
rfeed to a deep oil ﬂuid catalytic cracker. See Chapter 11.
rfeed to a hydro-cracker or hydro-treater. See Chapter 11.
The vacuum distillation of atmospheric residue. In modern reﬁnery practice the dis-
tillation of atmospheric residue is accomplished under high vacuum conditions ina specially designed tower whose internal equipment ensures a very lower pressuredrop. Normally the vacuum conditions in the ﬂash zone of the tower allows about thesame percentage of distillate based on the tower feed to be cut in this tower as the dis-tillate on whole crude in the atmospheric unit. Again the ﬂash zone temperature in thevacuum unit is kept below 700
◦F . Usually there are two or three vacuum distillates
from this tower. In a pure energy related reﬁnery there will be two. The heavier ofthe two say to a cut range of 750–930
◦F will be the feed to a distillate hydro-cracker
(see Chapter 7) or to a ﬂuid catalytic cracker (see Chapter 6). In both these caseshowever a small heavier cut is taken off and returned to the tower bottom in orderto correct the bottom distillate condradson carbon content to meet the speciﬁcationrequired for either of the two downstream processes. This distillate product is usuallytitled HVGO (Heavy Vacuum Gas Oil).
For those reﬁneries which produce lube oils as non energy products this bottom
distillate may be split into two side streams in order to provide the ﬂexibility requiredin the production of the lube oil blending stock speciﬁcations (see Chapter 12).
The light vacuum distillate is taken off as a top side stream and is usually routed to a
hydro-desulfurizer to be sent either to the gas oil pool as heating oil stock or routed52 CHAPTER 2
to the fuel oil pool as blending stock. This side stream is a cut range of 680–750◦F
and is usually labeled L VGO (Light Vacuum Gas Oil).
The vacuum residue. This is the bottom product from the vacuum distillation unit. Just
as in the case of the atmospheric residue it has several options for its use in meeting
the reﬁnery’ s product slate. In the case of the energy reﬁneries it can be upgraded toprime distillate products by a recycling thermal cracking process (see Chapter 11),coking, deep oil ﬂuid catalytic cracking (Chapter 11) or hydro-cracking or indeed acombination of these processes.
In the case of the production of lube oils it can be processed to remove the heavy
asphaltene portion of the stream. This deasphalted product is excellent lube oil blend-ing stock, commonly called ‘Bright Stock’, which, when de waxed and subject toother lube oil processes becomes the precursor for a variety of lube oil products (seeChapter 12). The asphalt portion of the de asphalting process has a wide spectrumas precursor to the many grades of bitumen used in building, and road making (seeChapter 12). The vacuum residue itself also ﬁgures in the production of bitumen.Where non-energy products are signiﬁcant in the reﬁnery’ s product slate, the vacuumresidue as produced is the key component in bitumen production.
Typical properties of some straight run product streams
The cuts and the stream properties are based on Arabian crude, and are shown here
for the light, medium, and heavy Arabian crude oil (Table 2.1).
Product streams from intermediate and ﬁnishing processes
Most ﬁnished marketable petroleum products are blends of some straight run prod-
uct streams with the products from further processing of some of these streams (seePart 2 of this chapter). This section deals with the intermediate or ﬁnishing productprocesses which provide the ﬁnished product precursors. Some of these more com-mon intermediate products together with reference to their respective processes aredescribed and discussed in the following paragraphs.
The LPG products. These two ﬁnished products, Propane LPG and Butane LPG are
products from straight run sources combined with the products from intermediate
processes such as the cracking and the naphtha reforming processes. Their ﬁnishedspeciﬁcation except for some mild desulfurization treating are met by the distillationof the source streams and the central light end units (see Chapter 4). No furtherprecursors are added, except for injection of odorizing chemicals for the detection ofleaks and thus their safe storage. Finished LPGs are stored in spheres for propaneand, usually, bullets for butane.PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND A REFINER Y CONFIGURATION 53

Butane LPG is however used extensively as a ﬁnished gasoline product precursor to
correct for volatility of the ﬁnished gasoline.
Gasoline precursors. Gasoline is a blend of straight run naphtha (usually light
naphtha) and products of intermediary processes. These are usually suitably boil-
ing range products from:
rCatalytic Reforming Process (see Chapter 5)
rFluid Catalytic Cracking Process (see Chapter 6)
Modern reﬁning conﬁgurations may also include processes which convert low qualityproducts to gasoline precursors enhancing the gasoline’ s octane rating. These includethe alkylation and Isomerization processes (see Chapter 9). Others which are lesscommon are the oxygenated precursors (Chapter 1).PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND A REFINER Y CONFIGURATION 55
Catalytic reforming
This is a process which converts a relatively low octane straight run naphtha into
a high octane liquid reformate which is a major precursor for ﬁnished gasoline.Of equal importance in upgrading naphtha this process also produces a high purityhydrogen stream. This makes the process a most important one in a modern dayreﬁnery conﬁguration.
Brieﬂy the straight run heavy naphtha is heated and is passed over beds of platinum
catalyst contained in three separate reactor vessels. A recycle hydrogen stream ac-companies the feed through these reactors and the reaction temperature is controlledby heaters between each reactor. The reaction of principle importance is the dehy-drogenation of the naphthenes in the feed to their respective aromatic homologue. Inso doing the excess hydrogen molecule is released as a hydrogen by product. Otherreactions also occur which enhance the octane rating of the debutanized reformateliquid product. Among these are some isomerization and to some extent some hydro-cracking. Details of this process are given in Chapter 5.
The properties of the debutanized reformate is given in the following table. The
feed to the catalytic reformer in this case included the straight run naphtha (SRN)from the crude unit and the naphtha streams from gas oil hydro-treaters and a thermalcracker. This feedstream was also hydro-treated before entering the catalytic reformer(Table 2.2).

Naphtha from a ﬂuid catalytic cracking unit
The Naphtha from the FCCU is always a prime precursor for the gasoline blends."
"There are usually two naphtha streams which are the debutanized overhead distillatefrom the Cracker’ s main fractionator. This distillate is fractionated to produce a lightnaphtha and the heavy naphtha. As can be seen from Chapter 7 the Fluid CatalyticCracker is a very ﬂexible unit with respect to the feedstock that it can process. As amatter of fact the only real constraints on the process is a high metal and Condradsoncarbon content of the feed. And even this is removed with the improved catalystsnow available and some modiﬁcation to the conventional process (see Chapter 11 ondeep oil cracking). The effect of the feedstock quality however is conﬁned mostly tothe severity of cracking and the resulting yields of the cracked products. The qualityof the streams from the main fractionator can be and usually are constant. Table 2.3shows the properties of the two naphtha streams from the catalytic cracker which inthis case is operated on Sasson Heavy Vacuum Gas Oil at a 70% severity conversion.
Alkylation plant
The other most common precursor for the gasoline products is the liquid alkalate from
the alkalation process. This process is described in some detail in Chapter 9, and itspart in the gasoline blending pool is shown in Part 2 of this chapter (Table 2.4).
There are other processes that produce precursors for gasoline and diesel motive fuels,
among these are the products from the Oleﬁn Condenser process and other polymerprocesses. These are not so common however, but details of the oleﬁn condensingprocess are given in Chapter 9.PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND A REFINER Y CONFIGURATION 57

The middle distillate products
Finished products derived from the middle distillate boiling range include:
rKerosene for illumination
rKerosene as a precursor for Aviation Turbine Gasoline (ATG)
rKerosene for Tractor Vaporizing Oil (TVO)
rKerosene as a Precursor for Automotive Diesel
rKerosene for Asphalt Cut Back
rLight Gas Oil for Diesel Fuel
rHeavy Gas Oil for Domestic Heating Oil
rAll Middle Distillates for Fuel Oil Blending
The straight run kerosene products. Most straight run kerosenes are desulfurized and
routed directly to the ﬁnished product blending pools. The exception is in the case ofthe aviation turbine gasoline (ATG) which will require the kerosene precursor to betreated for aromatics reduction or removal to meet the strict smoke point speciﬁcationsassociated with this ﬁnished product. In present day reﬁneries this is accomplishedby hydro-treating the kerosene using a nickel catalyst. In older reﬁneries the aro-matics contained in the cut were removed as an extract in a process using SO
2as
a solvent. In some cases also the speciﬁcation for the tractor vaporizing oil (TVO)requires the kerosene, which is the major component of this ﬁnished product, to bede-aromatized also. Some details of the de-aromatization hydro-treating process aregiven in Chapter 8. The straight run kerosene product destined for fuel oil and as-phalt blending are not usually desulfurized before routing to the respective blendingpools.
Some general speciﬁcations for the various ﬁnished products containing predomi-
nately kerosene are given in Table 2.5.58 CHAPTER 2

Straight run light gas oil. This cut is always desulfurized and routed to the automotive
diesel blending pool. It is the major component of this ﬁnished product. Its four major
speciﬁcations are:
rCetane number
rPour point
rSulfur content
rFlash point
Other important requirement is its volatility as deﬁned by the ASTM distillationanalysis. Except for the sulfur content these speciﬁcation are met by the set pointsestablished in the atmospheric crude unit. Some kerosene may be blended to lightenthe front end of the ﬁnished product if required, and some heavy gas oil or LightVacuum Gas Oil (L VGO) may be added to maximize the ﬁnished product yield butall limited to the product’ s ASTM distillation and the other speciﬁcations.
Note: Where the reﬁnery conﬁguration contains a thermal cracker, the gas oil cut
from this unit may, depending on the unit’ s fractionator cut points, be added to the
light straight run gas oil as feed to the hydro-treater and its subsequent routing to thediesel blending.
Straight run heavy gas oil. This cut could be a heavy side stream from the atmospheric"
"crude distillation tower or if there is a vacuum unit in the conﬁguration it could be one
or more of the gas oil distillate cuts from this tower. Most reﬁneries that maximizemotive fuels would almost certainly have a cracking unit of some kind in their conﬁg-uration. More often than not this would be a ﬂuid catalytic process taking as feed theheavy vacuum gas oil stream. The heavy gas oil from the atmospheric distillation unitwould be hydro-treated before being routed to the heating oil blending pool or partlyto heating oil and partly to fuel oil pool. If there is a catalytic cracker in the reﬁneryunits the cycle oil from this unit would be blended with the straight run heavy gas oilto be desulfurized and routed as described.

meet heating oil speciﬁcations. Some traditional product speciﬁcations for the variousgas oil ﬁnished products are given in Table 2.6. With the advent of low-sulfur diesel,these speciﬁcations are being modiﬁed considerably, with sulfur levels as low as 50wt-ppm (0.005 wt%) and cetane numbers in excess of 50.
Products from the residues
The residues from the atmospheric and vacuum distillation of crude oil open a spec-trum of saleable products which constitute a major source of revenue for many re-ﬁneries. These are listed in order of their importance as follows:
rThe fuel oils
rPetroleum coke
rThe lube oil products
rThe asphalt products
The fuel oil products. There are two common fuel oil products in use today. The ﬁrst
and perhaps the second most common product is the marine diesel. As the namesuggests it is the fuel used by heavy marine diesel engines. It is the least viscousof the three grades and is usually a blend of a middle distillate (kerosene and/orgas oil) with atmospheric residue. It has a general speciﬁcation as shown in Ta-ble 2.7.60 CHAPTER 2

The most common fuel oil used in industry is the No 6 fuel oil which is either a
suitably cut atmospheric residue or a vacuum residue blended with a distillate cutback. It may mean also that a cutback distillate has been desulfurized to meet theproduct sulfur speciﬁcation of the fuel oil. A general speciﬁcation for No 6 fuel isalso shown in Table 2.7. Again, depending on use, sulfur speciﬁcations are beinglowered in many instances.
Several other fuel oil grades are often produced by blending one or other of the
distillation residues with suitable distillate streams. These however are customizedfor clients speciﬁc needs. For example a No 5 fuel oil grade was once produced insome quantity for the steel industry. This is a product less viscous and of a lowergravity than No 6 fuel oil. It is now seldom produced.
Petroleum coke. This is not found in crude oil but is formed by the thermal cracking
of the residues from both atmospheric and vacuum distillation of the crude. The
coke is really the thermal conversion of these heavy products which contain theresins and asphaltenes contained in the crude. The major purpose of the ‘Coking’processes is to upgrade the residues by producing lighter marketable products inthe gasoline and middle distillate range. The coke becomes the by-product of thesethermal cracking mechanisms (see Chapter 12 for more details on these processes).The coke as produced in the reﬁnery process is called Green Coke and this may be
subclassiﬁed as Sponge coke from a delayed coking process and Needle Coke from
a Fluid coking process. Approximately one half of the green coke (both Needle andSponge) is further calcined to make the calcined coke product."
"Uncalcined coke has a heating value of around 14,000 Btu/lb and is primarily used
as a fuel. High sulfur uncalcined sponge coke is particularly popular in the cementindustry since the sulfur reacts to form sulfates. Low sulfur low metals sponge cokemay be calcined to remove volatiles and is used mostly as anodes in the aluminumPETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND A REFINER Y CONFIGURATION 61

Lube oil production. The second most important products from the residue of crude
oil is the lube oil products. Details of the lube oil production processes are given in
Chapter 12. A brief description of this aspect of reﬁnery products with a short historyof its growth in the industrial countries. The development of the industrial revolutiongave a big incentive for the production of high quality lubricants from the processingof crude oil. A further boost to these processes followed the rapid development of theautomotive industry, particularly in the Western world. More and more sophisticatedprocesses were developed for the purpose of this growing demand and an increasingquality requirement. This has culminated in the use of the hydro-processes usedextensively in today’ s modern reﬁneries.
Through the years the lubricant market has developed its own lexicon of terms. Some
of these are:
A Lube Oil Base Stock—This refers to a base lube oil product from a lube oil process
which meets all the requirement for blending to make a spectrum of lube oil ﬁnished
product.
A Lube Oil Slate—is a set of lube oil base stocks that makes up a particular ﬁnished
product. Usually these are between 3 and 5 such stocks.
Neutral Lubes—are lube oil streams obtained as side cuts from the vacuum distillation
of the crude oil atmospheric residue.
Bright Stock Lubes—These are processed as de-asphalted oil from vacuum residues.
(Note: de-asphalted oils are also used as feedstock to ﬂuid catalytic crackers andmore commonly to heavy oil hydro-crackes).
Parafﬁnic Lubes—Are all grades, both neutral and bright stock with a ﬁnished vis-
cosity index of more than 75.
Naphthenic Lubes—Are all grades with ﬁnished viscosity index of less than 75.62 CHAPTER 2

The important properties of lube oils are:

rKinetic viscosity (Centistokes)
rColor
rPour point
rFlash point
rV olatility
rOxidation stability
rThermal stability
Although Kinematic Viscosity is measured in centistokes it is usually speciﬁed in
Saybolt Seconds (SSU). Speciﬁcations for lube oils are established by the Societyof Automotive Engineers who also perform research on a wide range of automotivetopics. One very well known motor oil speciﬁcation is the SAE viscosity. This is givenin Table 2.9. Multi-grade oils (10–20, 10–30, 10–50, etc.) prevail in today’ s markets.
There are a great many speciﬁcations covering all grades and uses for the lube oil
products. Many of these, particularly for the motor lube oils, are customized withincertain basic maximum, and minimum constraints (such as viscosity), for the localclimate, motor type, and legislative requirements.
The asphalt products. Asphalt is the heaviest boiling point product that can be pro-
duced in the processing of crude oil. Contrary to common beliefs asphalts can only
be made from crude oils that contain asphalt. That is they contain the right amountof the carbon and the resin that allows the formation of asphalts. A full description ofthe types and the production of asphalt is given in Chapter 12. Brieﬂy most grades ofasphalt are produced from the deep cut vacuum residue of suitable crudes. The asphaltextract from the lube oil de-asphalting process may also be included with the residuefor the production of certain asphalt grades. The ﬁnished product is often treated byair blowing to achieve the required hardness and ductility of the product. Asphaltbecomes an important product because of its wide use in road and other buildingindustries.PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND A REFINER Y CONFIGURATION 63
2.3 A discussion on the motive fuels of gasoline and diesel
Of all the petroleum products that are marketable, motive fuels are the ones that are"
"most common to the general public. Because of this they are continually in the publicfocus for change with respect to their performance, their availability and cost, andtheir effect on the environment. This section of Chapter 2 continues with a closer lookat the make up, manufacture and the environmental impact of these two motive fuels.It begins with the gasolines.
The parameters of gasoline
Parameters affecting engine performance
The following parameters are the major criteria in the production of ﬁnished gasolinewith respect to its performance: These are:
rOctane number
rThermal efﬁciency
rV olatility of the gasoline
rEngine deposits
Octane number. Among the most important parameters in the manufacture of gasoline
is its resistance to ‘Knocking’. This resistance is expressed as an ‘Octane Number’.A deﬁnition of octane number and its measurement has already been given in Cha-pter 1.
Knocking limits the power that can be developed by the engine/fuel combination.
Detonation is the spontaneous explosion of the residual fuel (after almost completecombustion) and the air in the combustion chamber as the normal mechanism ofcombustion nears its end. It’ s a very fast oxidation reaction which sets up its ownﬂame front. The knocking occurs when this front and that of the normal combustioncollide creating a pressure wave.
Another, and perhaps, a more destructive form of engine knock is ‘Pre-ignition’.
This is the spontaneous ignition of the fuel/air mixture before the ignition spark.This in turn is caused when the unburned gases are compressed in the cylinder andthe resulting temperature reaches the auto ignition point before the ignition sparkoccurs. This pre-ignition usually causes major engine damage in just a few secondsor minutes.
Increasing humidity, cooler ambient air temperatures, and altitude reduce require-
ments for antiknock.64 CHAPTER 2
Thermal efﬁciency. As may be expected fuel economy is a factor in determining the
thermal efﬁciency of the auto engine. The engines efﬁciency increases with the in-
crease in compression ratio. However with the increase in compression ratio there is anincreasing need for fuels that do not knock. Since around 1980s engine manufacturershave been incorporating knock sensors to the engine electronic management systemto continuously adjust the ignition timing. This development allows the timing of thespark to occur in advance of the piston reaching the top of its travel. The maximumengine efﬁciency is produced with this timing control measured and adjusted by thecomputer control of fuel to air ratio. Further development and testing of individualengine design sets an optimum criteria for fuel octane number of the fuel and air ratiofor lean mixture combustion.
V olatility of the gasoline. Another important property of gasoline is its volatility. The
gasoline must be volatile enough to provide the engine capable of starting at the
lowest temperature expected in its service. At too low a volatility the engine wouldhave difﬁculty starting and would be prone to stalling in service. On the other handtoo high a volatility would cause excessive vapor which in turn would cause vaporlock in pipes and pumps, etc.
Engine deposits. Engine deposits affect fuel efﬁciency and emissions. Deposits are
of particular concern in the carburetor, fuel injectors, inlet valves, and combustion
chamber. These deposit are essentially ﬁne carbon granules which are formed byhigh inlet valve temperatures, airﬂow inconsistencies, and minor oil contaminat-ion.
Parameters affecting pollution by emission
Air pollution is an important factor in motive fuel design and manufacture. There are
two main types of air pollutants that affect the manufacture of motive fuels. Theseare:
rHazardous air pollutants (HAPs)
rCriteria air pollutants
Hazardous air pollutantsThese are air pollutants that have been shown statistically to cause major healthdisorders such as cancer, neurological damage, respiratory irritation, and reproductivedisorders. In general these pollutants are believed to have no threshold, and are harmfuleven in small doses or concentrations. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)has been regulating these pollutants since the 1977 Clean Air Act. There are 189hazardous air pollutants among which Benzene, formaldehyde, and 1,3-butadienewhich are formed by combustion of motive fuel such as gasoline.PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND A REFINER Y CONFIGURATION 65
Criteria air pollutants
These are pollutants that can injure health, harm the environment, and cause propertydamage. These pollutants do have a threshold level however, below which they arerelatively harmless. The EPA labels these pollutants as Criteria Air Pollutants because
the basis for setting standards are developed from health based criteria. There are sixcriteria of are pollutants that affect the design and manufacture of gasoline. Theseare:
rLead
rCarbon monoxide (CO)
rSulfur dioxide (SO
2)
rNitrogen dioxide (NO 2)
rParticulate matter
rOzone (O 3)."
"Lead. This emission from gasoline engines have been known to be toxic for several
decades. It adversely affects kidneys, liver, and other organs, and leads to neurolog-ical impairment, learning deﬁcits, and behavioral disorders. The reduction of leadprograms conducted in the 1970s and 1980s have made leaded gasoline (TEL added)unavailable for on-road vehicles in the 1990s.
Carbon monoxide (CO). This is a colorless odorless and poisonous gas produced
from the incomplete combustion of carbon in fuels. Elevated exposures are serious
for those suffering from cardiovascular disease and leads to visual impairment, lossof manual dexterity, and the ability to perform complex tasks. At high enough levelsit depresses cardiac activity and respiration, causes convulsions and ultimately death.Over half the carbon monoxide emissions are from motor vehicles.
Sulfur dioxide. This is formed during burning of sulfur containing fuels. Motor
vehicles are a minor source of SO
2due to the de-sulfurizing processes used in the
production of motive fuel components. Short-term exposure to high concentration
leads to reduced lung function, while longer exposures are associated with respira-tory problems. Sulfur dioxide mixed with nitrogen oxide is a major contributor to theformation of Acid Rain. This in turn causes acidiﬁcation of lakes, rivers, and water-
ways. It damages crops and trees, and accelerates the corrosion of building materialsand coatings.
Nitrogen dioxide. Also known as nitrogen peroxide is a brown gas formed by high
temperature combustion of fuels. It is one of a family of nitrogen oxides which are
often treated as one species under the term NO
x. Nitrogen dioxide is a severe irritant
to the lungs and can cause respiratory infections, pneumonia and bronchitis. Nitrogendioxide coupled with volatile organic compound (VOC) and ozone are the maincomponents of smog.66 CHAPTER 2
Particulate matter. Dust, dirt, smoke, and liquid droplets form the particulate matter
in motor emission and pollutants. Some of the liquid droplets are formed in the
atmosphere by the condensation of sulfates, nitrates, and hydrocarbons. Fine particleswith diameter less than 2.5 µm are emitted by motor vehicles. Gasoline driven vehicles
however do not emit signiﬁcant levels of particulate matter compared with dieseldriven engines. Particulate matter aggravates existing respiratory and cardiovasculardisease, damages lung tissue and may cause cancer. Fine particles of 2.5 µm or less
are considered more serious since they can penetrate easily into the respiratory tractand are retained longer. Particulate matter also contributes to haze.
Ozone. This photochemical oxidant is found in the atmosphere from ground level
to 6 miles above the ground and again in the Stratosphere 6–30 miles above the
earth. At ground level Ozone together with the Nitrogen oxides, the volatile organiccompounds and sunlight are the major constituents of ‘Smog’. Ozone is a strongoxidant and damages lung tissue, and reduces lung function.
More details of gas emission are given in Chapter 5.
Meeting the gasoline parameters
Prior to 1990 the performance and emission characteristics were mainly the responsi-
bility of the engine manufacturers with some notable changes imposed on the gasolinemanufactures. Notable among the restrictions imposed on the reﬁneries in the gaso-line manufacture was the restriction on the use of TEL (tetra ethyl lead) as an octaneenhancer. The EPA (environmental protection agency) had, as early as 1970 enforceda program to reduce the addition of lead so that even before 1990 there was availableonly ‘no lead’ gasoline for road vehicles. The ‘Clean Air Act’ of 1990 however put theonus on the gasoline manufacturer for meeting the act’ s requirements. In the USA andindeed the North American Continent a program to introduce reformulated gasolinewas launched. This RFG allows the performance of the gasoline to be retained whilstreducing the harmful emission caused by the traditional octane enhancers such asaromatics (from reformates) and oleﬁnes (from cracked naphtha).
Reducing aromatics in gasoline. The most stringent environmental restriction im-
posed on aromatics in gasoline is on benzene in gasoline. This component in benzene
has now been reduced to levels below 1.0 %vol in the product. Reﬁning processingphilosophy has undergone some extensive changes to meet this single requirement.The following steps have needed to be taken in part or as a whole to meet this change:
rReducing reformer severity. This also reduces the quantity of the heavier aromatics.
rReducing the ﬁnal boiling point of the gasoline. This essentially reduces the amountof the heavier aromatics in the gasoline.PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND A REFINER Y CONFIGURATION 67
rIncreasing the quantity of isoparafﬁn. This is accomplished by saturating the ben-
zene ring and isomerization of the naphthenes to isoparafﬁns."
"rReducing the aromatics in the cracked naphtha stock. Catalytic cracker naphtha ishigh in oleﬁns in the front end but high in aromatics in the back end. The reductionof aromatics from this source is accomplished by lowering the cut’ s ﬁnal boilingpoint.
rAromatic extraction using an extraction process similar to that used in produc-ing the petrochemical aromatic complex feed (e.g., the sulfolane process). Onlyabout 20 of the largest reﬁneries in North America has this extraction facility how-ever.
Reducing the oleﬁn in gasoline. Almost all the oleﬁns and sulfur in the gasoline pool
come from the Catalytic Cracker naphtha with a relatively small amount from thermalcrackers. The following methods again in part or as a whole are used to reduce thisoleﬁn content:
rAlkylation and Etheriﬁcation. The light oleﬁns of C
5can be fractionated out
and following a simple sulfur removal is feed to an alkylation process to pro-duce good high octane C
9alkylate. Alternatively the light fraction from the
cracked naphtha can be processed to the oxygenate TAME (Tertiary Amyl MethylEther).
rIsomerization of the C
6and C 7fractions. These two oleﬁn components of cracked
naphtha may be hydrogenated and isomerized to provide a good octane rating. Thetwo oleﬁn components are only small in quantity in gasoline they are howeverhighly reactive and their removal and conversion is necessary to meet the presentrestrictions in gasoline manufacture.
Meeting the gasoline sulfur content. Almost all of the sulfur in gasoline comes from
the catalytic cracker and other thermal crackers. The current phase 2 of the RFGprogram is expected to reduce sulfur in gasoline to around 30 ppm by weight; Europeanspeciﬁcations are being lowered to 10 wt-ppm. To meet this new criteria reﬁners arelooking at the following approaches:
rRoute the heavy end about 20 %vol of the catalytic naphtha into the middle distillatepool. This does not reduce the sulfur but it moves a large portion of it and the heavyaromatics into other parts of the product slate. Thus reducing the sulfur and aromaticcontent of the gasoline.
rEither hydrogenate or treat with a caustic type wash the lighter portion of the crackednaphtha. This is rich in oleﬁns and sulfur. Treating by hydrogenation does reducethe octane value of the naphtha in that it saturates the oleﬁns to lower octane parafﬁnor naphthene. Treating with sulfur extraction wash (e.g., UOP’ s Merox process) isthe often preferred route.68 CHAPTER 2

rThe back end of cracked naphtha is high in sulfur, aromatics, and oleﬁns. This
may be hydrogenated using a catalyst selective in removing sulfur, and leaving thearomatics essentially as they were.
rHydro-treating of the catalytic cracker gas oil feed is becoming quite common. Thissigniﬁcantly reduces the sulfur content of all the cracked products from the catalyticcracker unit.
Manufacturing gasoline
The requirements of the clean air act of 1990 and additions to it since has changed
reﬁning requirements to meet this product’ s need quite signiﬁcantly. Prior to thisdate much of the gasoline ﬁnished product recipe consisted of normal light naphtha,a reformate, usually some cracked naphtha, and possibly an alkalate some butanemay be included if required to meet volatility. The Clean Air requirement and itssubsequent additions forces a reduction of both the reformate and the cracked stock(see Tables 2.10 and 2.11).

Using the oxygenates. Oxygenates were used originally simply as a additive to im-
prove octane number. However, because of their oxygen content they are now added
also ton reduce the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon in the emission gases. Thereare a number of oxygenates now used in gasoline manufacture some of the morecommon are given in Table 2.12.
The EPA have established limits for the use of each oxygenates in gasoline blends."
"For example, MTBE may be blended up to 15 %vol subject to an overall limit of2.7 %wt oxygen content. The role of MTBE and other oxygenates in the U.S. wasdiscontinued in 2002 after it was discovered that underground storage tanks had notbeen upgraded to retain reformulated gasoline. As a consequence tanks were leakinggasoline that contained MTBE into the ground and drinking water systems.
Diesel fuel
The policies in place to control, or at least to endeavor to control, emissions from
motive fuels has moved from gasoline engines to diesel engines. Similar to the gasolinefuels diesel has also changed in composition to meet these environmental constraintswhile still maintaining a required performance standard. These changes have imposeda major impact on the reﬁning industry at a time when the demand for diesel isincreasing. Again as in the case of the gasoline fuel reformulated diesel fuel becomespart of the modern diesel speciﬁcation and composition. These are described anddiscussed in the following sections.
The diesel engine
Before dealing with the diesel fuel it may be advantageous to review brieﬂy the
principle of the diesel engine itself, diesel engines have historically been preferred in70 CHAPTER 2
many applications because of their simplicity of design, power, durability, and higher
fuel efﬁciency. Diesel engines ﬁt into three categories and these are:
rLow speed engines
rMedium speed engines
rHigh speed engines
Low speed engines. These operate at less than 300 revs per min (rpm), and are used
for applications that require sustained heavy loads at constant engine speed. Examplesare the main propulsion engines in marine vessels and engines used in electric powergeneration.
Medium speed engines. These operate at speeds between 300 and 1,000 rpm, and are
used for applications with fairly high loads, and relatively constant speeds. Engines
used in auxiliary power plants on marine vessels, and in smaller power generationplants are examples of this type of diesel engine.
High speed engines. Operate at speeds above 1000 rpm, and are designed for frequent
and wide variations in load and speed. These are the type of engines used for road
transport and Diesel locomotives.
Almost all diesel engines use a standard four stroke design which are, intake, com-
pression, power, and exhaust. During the intakes stroke, air alone enters the cylinder,during the compression stroke the air is compressed by the upward movement of thepiston. The ﬁnal temperature and pressure reached in the cylinder is a function ofthe compression ratio, engine speed, and engine design. Pressures of 450 psig, andtemperatures of 500
◦F are typical. Shortly before the end of the compression stroke,
one or more jets of fuel are injected into the cylinder. The fuel pump introducing thesejets is usually cam driven type and operates at pressures between 1,800 and 30,000psig. The fuel does not ignite immediately. There is a delay period when the fueldroplets vaporize and reach their ignition temperature. The extent of this time delay isaffected by the design of the engine, the temperatures of the inlet air and fuel, and thedegree to which the injected fuel is atomized on entering the cylinder. This ignitiondelay must be kept as short as possible to avoid accumulation of fuel in the cylinderbefore ignition. Such a situation causes diesel knock when this large quantity of fueldetonates.
After ignition, fuel injection continues for a portion of the power stroke. This fuel
burns almost instantaneously with the remaining air and combustion products in thecylinder. This more controlled burning period is referred to as diffusion combustion.Fuel injection is stopped part way through the power stroke. Finally the exhaust strokepurges the combustion products from the cylinder, and the cycle begins again.PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND A REFINER Y CONFIGURATION 71
Design improvements to the basic diesel engine
Fuel injection improvements. Most diesel engines built in the 1980s were equipped
with indirect fuel injection system (IDI). Modern engines are equipped with the
direct fuel injection (DI) which is designed for the geometry of the combustionchamber, and is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient. (Note: This can well be compared withthe direct injection concept in gasoline engines which was introduced around this timealso).
Four valve cylinder heads. This promotes better movement of both combustion air
and exhaust gases. This causes high turbulence of the fuel and air in the combustion
chamber resulting in good distribution of the fuel and increased ﬂame speed whichreduces the ignition delay time.
Electronically controlled fuel injection timing. This allows for the injection of a small
quantity of fuel before the main charge into combustion chamber. The result is a
quieter combustion minimizing the amount of premixed combustion and maximizingthe more controlled diffusion combustion.
Increasing the amount of air introduced into the cylinder. Using a Turbocharger,"
"which is an air compressor driven by a turbine using exhaust gas energy, the mass of
air introduced into the cylinder is increased. This enables the engine to burn morefuel thus increasing its power output. Using this concept the power output for a dieselengine can be increased by as much as 50% for the same engine displacement.
The parameters of diesel fuel
The following are the major parameters in meeting the diesel fuel speciﬁcation with
respect to engine performance or emission or both:
rThe cetane number
rAromatic content
rDensity
rSulfur content
rDistillation
rViscosity
rCloud and pour points
rFlash point
Most of these parameters have been deﬁned elsewhere in this book. This section thendeals with the effect these parameters have on the performance of the diesel engine orthe emission of undesirable components from the engine or both. Where the deﬁnition72 CHAPTER 2
of the parameter is not dealt with in detail elsewhere in the book, then deﬁnition is
included here.
Cetane number. This is the result of an engine test that compares the ignition delay
for a fuel. For this test two reference fuels are chosen. The ﬁrst is normal cetane
(C16) and the second is an isomer of cetane which is heptamethylnonane. The normal
cetane is arbitrarily given the cetane number of 100, while the isomer as the secondreference fuel is assigned a cetane number of 15. The fuel being tested is run in astandard test engine. The cetane number is derived by comparing the ignition delayof the test diesel with a blend of the two reference fuels. The cetane number is thencalculated using the equation:
Cetane Number =% normal cetane +0.15×% heptamethylnonane.
Higher cetane numbers indicates that the fuel has a shorter ignition delay. The higherthe cetane number also results in less CO and unburnt hydrocarbons in the engineemission gases. This has a greater effect in the older diesel engine. Modern enginesare equipped with retarded ignition timing and increasing the cetane number has asmaller effect on these more modern engines.
Aromatics. The aromatic content of diesel fuel can be measured for single ring aro-
matics, multi-ring or poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Some studies show that
reducing the aromatics results in the reduction of all regulated emissions, but otherstudies have indicated that the reduction of emissions of unburned hydrocarbons,NO
x, and particulates can only be achieved by reducing multi-ring aromatics.
Density. As density is a measure of the mass per unit volume, diesel fuels of low
density require a longer injection time to deliver the same mass of fuel into thecylinder. The longer the injection time the lower is the peak temperatures which, inturn, results in lower No
xformation. At high loads and engine speeds, the longer
injection interval causes some incomplete combustion, resulting in a high emissionof unburned hydrocarbons and CO. When the load is being increased however thelower density fuel results in less over-fueling, which actually decreases the emissionof particulates, hydrocarbons, and CO.
Sulfur. The sulfur in diesel fuel is burned to SO
2, a portion of which is further oxidized
to sulfates. This binds with water to form a portion of the particulate matter. Because
only a small percent of the total sulfur in fuel is oxidized to sulfates the contributionof sulfates to the total particulates is quite small. However if an oxidation catalystis used to reduce emission of hydrocarbons, CO, and particulate matter a signiﬁcantamount of the SO
2is converted to sulfates and consequently making a signiﬁcant
contribution to the particulates in the emission gases.PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND A REFINER Y CONFIGURATION 73
Distillation. The distillation range of diesel fuel has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on engine
performance. This is especially so in medium and high speed engines. If the fuel is too
volatile the engine loses power and efﬁciency because of vapor lock in the fuel systemor poor droplet penetration into the cylinder. On the other hand if the volatility of thefuel is too low, the engine will lose power and efﬁciency as a result of poor atomizationof the fuel. Both the front end and the back end of the distillation are important. If the10 %vol point is too high, the engine will have difﬁculty starting. A low 50% pointreduces particulate emissions and odor. Because heavier molecules are more difﬁcultto burn, both soot and the soluble organic fraction (SOF) of the particulate emissionsare increased if the 90% point is too high, the emission of unburned hydrocarbonswill also increase.
Viscosity. Fuel viscosity has an important effect on the fuel pump and injector system.
The shape of the fuel spray is affected by viscosity. If this is too high, the fuel will"
"not be properly atomized into the cylinder, which will result in poor combustion, lossof power, and efﬁciency, with an increase in CO and hydrocarbon emission. Anothereffect of poor atomizing of the fuel will be to allow the fuel to impinge on the cylinderwalls, and remove the lubricating ﬁlm. This results in excessive wear and increase ofhydrocarbon emissions.
If the viscosity of the fuel is too low, the injection spray is too soft and will not
penetrate far enough into the cylinder. A loss of power and efﬁciency will occur dueto this. Where the fuel system is also lubricated by the fuel, as is the case in someengine designs, increased wear to the system will result through low fuel viscosity.
Cloud and pour point. Cold weather performance of diesel fuel is a key considera-
tion for users. Actual speciﬁcations for cold ﬂow properties are based on expected
temperature extremes and different test methods are used in different parts of theworld. In the United States cloud point is used as an indicator of the cold ﬂowproperties of the fuel. Cloud point is the temperature at which wax begins to pre-cipitate out of the fuel. The longer parafﬁn molecules in the fuel precipitate as a waxwhen the temperature falls below the cloud point. This wax clogs unheated fuel linesand ﬁlters. The more parafﬁnic a fuel the higher will be its cloud point. In someparts of the world, pour point is used as an indication of the lowest temperature atwhich a fuel can be pumped. Pour points are generally 4–5
◦C lower than the cloud
point.
Flash point. The ﬂash point of a fuel is the temperature that the fuel must be heated
to produce an ignitable mixture of vapor and air above the surface of the liquid. This
property is only important for safe handling and storage of the fuel. It has no effecton the performance of the fuel or its emission properties. If the ﬂash point is too low,ﬁre or explosion could occur when it is handled.74 CHAPTER 2
Meeting the diesel fuel parameters
There are various solutions for meeting the parameters of diesel fuel in the design
of the fuel. These solutions range from fractionation, adding improvers, and morecomplex hydro-processing. Using modern developments in hydro-processing it ispossible to convert low-grade blend stocks, such as FCCU or thermal cracker prod-uct streams to good diesel precursors. Among the more important parameters to bemet both from the performance and the emission aspects of the fuel are discussedbelow.
Increasing cetane value. The simplest way to improve cetane number is to use an
appropriate ignition improvement additive. These are mainly alkyl nitrates. The ef-
fectiveness of cetane improvement additives tend to be linear with addition rate, how-ever the improvement can vary with different diesel blend stock. Parafﬁns whichalready have high cetane value respond best to the additives. Aromatics on theother hand, which have a low cetane number have a poorer response. About 500wppm of standard alkyl nitrate will increase the cetane value by 2–5 numbers.Another way to increase cetane number is to modify the hydrocarbon type in thediesel blend. Figure 2.2 shows the relationship between molecular types and cetanenumber.
Straight chain parafﬁn molecules have the highest cetane numbers while multiple
ring aromatics have the lowest cetane number improvement also occurs during thehydro-treating of the gas oil fractions used as blend components in the diesel prod-uct. During the hydro-treating to remove the organic sulfur and nitrogen speciesfound in these untreated gas oil fractions, the molecules containing these items areopened and saturated to form parafﬁns and naphthenes. At the same time some of the
Figure 2.2. Cetane number of hydrocarbon types.PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND A REFINER Y CONFIGURATION 75
aromatic molecules contained in the gas oils are also opened and saturated increas-
ing the parafﬁn/naphthene content of the hydro-treated product. As a result of thisring opening and saturation a cetane number improvement of between 3 and 5 num-bers can be expected. Hydro-cracking of heavy gas oil fractions, and hydro-treatingof thermal cracked gas oils and FCC gas oils signiﬁcantly increase product cetanenumbers.
Meeting sulfur content. Sulfur content of 0.05 %wt is now quite a common require-
ment for diesel fuel. In most cases this level of sulfur can only be met by extensive
hydro-treating or hydro-cracking to remove the sulfur from the middle distillates thatwill be used to blend the diesel product. Some reﬁneries select their crude slate withlow sulfur crudes to reduce the hydro-treating demand. The impact on reﬁners to meetthis parameter extends beyond the severity of hydro-treating that may exist. It impactson the availability of hydrogen in the front end to the capacity for handling the sourgases (H
2S in particular) in the back end of the process. It is likely that the legislative"
"sulfur content in diesel may be reduced still further in the near future. This makes theselection between crude slate demand for low sulfur crude and a modiﬁed reﬁneryconﬁguration and operation a critical one.
Reducing aromatic content. With the increasing demand for diesel fuel, particularly
in North America and Europe, reﬁners will need to use streams normally routed to
heating oils of fuel as components for the diesel product blend. These streams areof lower quality and in particular contain higher quantity of aromatics that will beacceptable as diesel blend stocks without severe treating to improve their blendingcharacteristics. While high severity hydro-treating to remove sulfur and nitrogen helpsin reducing aromatics in acceptable diesel blend stocks, it will not be sufﬁcient toimprove the quality of the heating oil and fuel oil blend stocks to meet the diesel poolrequirement. Hydro treating using nickel molybdenum catalyst (de-aromatizationprocess) is being considered for the purpose of upgrading these poorer blend stocks.This de-aromatization process consists of two stages. The ﬁrst is processing over aconventional Co–Mo hydro-treating catalyst to remove sulfur and then to process overthe Ni–Mo catalyst. The nickel catalyst is poisoned by sulfur, thus the two stages. Theeconomics of using the de-aromatization process must be carefully evaluated becausethe metal content of the nickel catalyst represents a signiﬁcant investment. The processhowever operates at a higher space velocity and lower pressure than the conventionalCo–Mo hydro-treating process.
Improvement of cold ﬂow properties. Problems with meeting the cold ﬂow properties
of diesel fuel are associated with the presence of straight chain parafﬁns. Although
these have higher cetane numbers they pose cold ﬂow limitations because they tend toprecipitate as a wax at low temperatures. The simplest and probably the best solutionto this cold ﬂow property of these parafﬁns is the use of additives. These additives arehowever costly ranging from below $50 per thousand bbls for pour point reduction76 CHAPTER 2
to as high as $250 per thousand bbls for cloud point reduction (these are year 2000
dollars). Another alternative is to reduce the diesel FBP and add kerosene. Thisaction removes the heavier parafﬁnic molecules, which tend to precipitate at highertemperature. Reducing the cut point from 700
◦Ft o6 4 0◦F reduces the yield of diesel
by 6 %vol on crude. Solvent dewaxing is another option. In this process the waxforming components are selectively removed from the diesel product. This is onlyconsidered however for stocks from high parafﬁn crudes. Selective hydrocracking ofthe straight chain parafﬁns to smaller parafﬁn molecules is an option. This howeveris accompanied by a reduction in yield and cetane number. Finally isomerization ofthe straight chain parafﬁns to branched parafﬁns minimizes cetane and yield loss isa viable option. However these isomerization catalysts contain noble metals and aretherefore quite expensive and require the two stage process, desulfurization followedby the isomerization stage.
2.4 A reﬁnery process conﬁguration development
There are many steps necessary to complete a reﬁning company’ s marketing strategy
and production objectives. These steps may culminate in building new processingfacilities or revamping existing ones. The course of action that will ultimately beadopted will, almost invariably, be decided on an economic basis reﬂecting the com-pany’ s future proﬁtability picture. Among the most important of these steps howeverwill be the development of several reﬁning scenarios and processing conﬁgurations.
A process conﬁguration and its accompanying Block Flow Diagram is a blue print
and a basis for economic study and decision making. The ﬁnal and accepted conﬁgu-ration will also be the foundation for the design of new facilities or the revamping ofexisting ones. The block ﬂow diagram shows the calculated results of process plantdesign capacity, the quantity of process streams to and from each process plant, thesequence of the plants to one another in the reﬁning scheme, and ﬁnally the blendingrecipes (streams and their quantities that make up the ﬁnished product blends). Sucha development requires the in-depth knowledge of the reﬁning industry and relies,in no small measure, on the expertise of those companies that license processes andtheir technology.
The conﬁguration example described here would be one of many that would be
examined meeting the production and economic objectives of a particular reﬁneryoperation. In this example a reﬁning company wishes to examine a new ‘Grass Roots’conﬁguration that will produce the following products from a medium Middle Eastcrude, whose assay TBP curve is given as Figure 2.1.

For this conﬁguration the following processes will be examined:

rVacuum dist unit (VDU)
rLight ends dist units
rNaphtha hydrotreater (Nap Hds)

rLt gas oil hydrotreater (LGO Hds)

Then from the cut points corresponding to the stream’ s volume % on crude the fol-
lowing ASTM and TBP of the distillate streams leaving the unit are calculated. TheASTM (Starting at the C
5+level) are developed using the 50% point of each cut and
the 70% point converted to ASTM (using the Edmister correlation) and a straight linedrawn through them to give the ASTM distillation. These are then converted to TBP(again using the Edmister correlation) and are shown in Table 2.13.
These curves are given in Figure 2.3.From these curves the table below gives a component break down of the distillate
streams (Table 2.14).
The properties of these distillate cuts are determined using the component mid vol% on
crude multiplied by its volume on the respective cut or by use of indices as previouslydescribed.
The following table gives the component properties from the assay data (Table 2.15).Using the methods described earlier in this chapter the products from the atmospheric
crude unit including their salient properties are as follows (Table 2.16).
The vacuum crude unit, VDU. The feed to the vacuum distillation unit will be the

as the distillate streams shown above for the CDU. Thus the distillate streams and thevacuum residue stream including their salient properties are shown in Table 2.17.

85 %wt of the sulfur is to be removed. This amounts to 78,812 number of sulfur per
or 2,462.9 moles/CD.
Hydrogen required for sulfur removal in the gas oil is
Hydrogen for sulfur removal only =10914.0 ×0.85/32 = 289.9 mols/CD.
=289.9 ×379
=109,873 Scf (standard cuft @ 60◦F and
14.7 psia).
Hydrogen is also required for nitrogen removal and to close ruptured hydrocarbon
rings due to the sulfur removal. This reaction also produces light ends at the expenseof the treated gas oil yield. The total hydrogen requirements are
Hydrogen =933,439 Scf (this is from the Licensor’ s data).
There will also be a loss of hydrogen from the system (mostly due to the Flash drumoperation and Purge (see Chapter 8 for more details). This amounts to 186,689 Scf(again from Licensor data).

Needless to say this will be different for different operating companiesbased on their experiences, their maintenance philosophy, and design features of theseunits that they wish to consider. The latter case for example will consider, their cur-rent pump sparing philosophy, the sophistication of their plant control system and thelike.

Conclusion
This completes a very cursory look at the nature and reﬁning of crude oil. The remain-
der of this ﬁrst part of the encyclopedia continues with a more detailed examinationof the various processes, the economic aspect of the reﬁning industry, and the impactthe Industry has on modern living. It also describes and discusses modern techniquesused in the Industry and other allied industries (such as Engineering and Construction)to improve and optimize the design and operation of the reﬁning processes.Chapter 3
The atmospheric and vacuum crude distillation units
D.S.J. Jones
The distilling of petroleum products from crude oil to some extent or other has
long been practiced. Certainly the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans had someform of extracting a ﬂammable oil from, probably, weathered crude oil seepage. Itwasn’t though until the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth century that crude oilwell drilling was ﬁrst discovered and commercialized. Originally the crude oil wasreﬁned to produce essentially kerosene (lamp oil), and a form of gasoline knownthen as Benzine (as opposed to Benzene already being produced from coal) and theresidue used as pitch for calkin and sealing. The lamp oil or kerosene was produced toprovide a means of illumination, later a lighter cut known as naphtha was producedfor the same purpose but used in special pressurized lamps.
The production of these early distillates was made by cascading the crude oil through
successive stills each operating at successively higher temperatures. This is shown inthe following diagram Figure 3.1.
The crude enters the ﬁrst still to be heated to a temperature that vaporizes the light
components. The residue from this still enters the second one and heated to a highertemperature to vaporize the Benzine fraction. The residue enters the third still andheated to remove the Kerosene fraction. The residue from this still is a very light fueloil which may be further heated and partially vaporized to give a pitch of sorts as aresidue and a distillate which could be used as fuel. This distillate would later becomethe Diesel or Gas Oil fraction and used in the developing diesel engine.
The vapor from each still passes through a small packed wash section before being
condensed and collected in a condensate drum. A portion of the condensate is returnedto the top of the wash section as the wash liquid, similar to the reﬂux stream in moderndistillation towers. Usually steam was injected through the liquid phase of each stillto facilitate vaporization and to strip out the light ends.

Figure 3.1. Early continuous pipestill schematic.
This type of crude distillation was superseded by the continuous fractionation tower
used in modern petroleum reﬁning. This type of crude ‘Still’ remained in operationwell after the second World War in some oil reﬁneries. The author recalls such a stillin operation as late as 1956 in the reﬁnery that he was employed at, although therewere also in operation three other modern crude oil fractionating units. Indeed onemajor oil company even today call the crude distillation unit a ‘Pipestill’. This chapternow continues with the description of a present day atmospheric and vacuum crudeoil distillation units. It will be divided into two parts:
Part 1 The Atmospheric Crude Distillation Unit (CDU)Part 2 The Vacuum Crude Distillation Unit (VDU)Both parts will contain a process description with a schematic ﬂow sheet, a discussion
on the development of the material balance, a description and discussion on the designcharacteristics of the units, and ﬁnally a worked design example.
3.1 The atmospheric crude distillation unit
Process descriptionThe ﬁrst process encountered in any conventional Reﬁnery is the Atmospheric Crude"
"Distillation Unit. In this unit the crude oil is distilled to produce distillate streamsTHE ATMOSPHERIC AND V ACUUM CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS 113
which will be the basic streams for the reﬁnery product slate. These streams will
either be subject to further treating down stream or become feed stock for conversionunits that may be in the Reﬁnery Conﬁguration. A schematic ﬂow diagram of anatmospheric crude unit is shown in Figure 3.2.
Crude oil is pumped from storage to be heated by exchange against hot overhead and
product side streams in the Crude Unit. At a preheat temperature of about 200–250
◦F
water is injected into the crude to dissolve salt that is usually present. The mixtureenters a desalter drum usually containing an electrostatic precipitator. The salt watercontained in the crude is separated by means of this electrostatic precipitation. Thewater phase from the drum is sent to a sour water stripper to be cleaned before disposalto the oily water sewer.
It must be understood however that this ‘de-salting’ does not remove the organic
chlorides which may be present in the feed. This will be discussed later when dealingwith the tower’ s overhead system.
The crude oil leaves the desalter drum and enters a surge drum. Some of the light
ends and any entrained water are ﬂashed off in this drum and routed directly tothe distillation tower ﬂash zone (they do not pass through to the heater). The crudedistillation booster pump takes suction from this drum and delivers the desalted crudeunder ﬂow control to the ﬁred heater via the remaining heat exchange train.
On leaving heat exchanger train, the crude oil is heated in a ﬁred heater to a temperature
that will vaporize the distillate products in the crude tower. Some additional heat isadded to the crude to vaporize about 5% more than required for the distillate streams.This is called over ﬂash and is used to ensure good reﬂux streams in the tower. Theheated crude enters the fractionation tower in a lower section called the ﬂash zone.
The unvaporized portion of the crude leaves the bottom of the tower via a steam
stripper section, while the distillate vapors move up the tower counter current to acooler liquid reﬂux stream. Heat and mass transfer take place on the fractionatingtrays contained in this section of the tower above the ﬂash zone. Distillate productsare removed from selected trays (draw-off trays) in this sections of the tower. Thesestreams are stream stripped and sent to storage. The full naphtha vapor is allowedto leave the top of the tower to be condensed and collected in the overhead drum.

A ‘Pump around’ section is included at the light gas oil draw off. This is simply
an internal condenser which takes heat out of that section of the tower. This in turnensures a continued reﬂux stream ﬂow below that section. The product side streamsare stripped free of entrained light ends in separate stripping towers. These towers alsocontain fractionation trays (usually four but sometimes as many as six) and the sidestream drawn off the main tower enters the top tray of its respective stripper. Steamis injected below the bottom tray and moves up the tower to leave at the top, togetherwith the light ends strip out, and is returned to the main fractionator at a point directlyabove the side stream draw-off tray. These side stream stripper towers are usuallystacked one above the other in a single column in such a way as to allow free ﬂowfrom the side stream draw-off tray to its stripper tower. On a few occasions, wherethe particular side stream speciﬁcation requires it, the stripping may be effected byreboiling instead of using steam. One such requirement maybe in the Kero side streamif this stream is to be routed directly into jet fuel blending and therefore must be dry.
The residue ( unvaporized portion of the crude) leaves the ﬂash zone to ﬂow over four"
"stripping trays counter current to the ﬂow of stripping steam. This stripping steamenters the tower below the bottom stripping tray. Its purpose primarily is to strip theresidue free of entrained light ends. The fact that this steam enters the ﬂash zone it alsoenhances the ﬂashing of the crude in this zone by creating a reduced partial pressurefor the liquid/vapor separation. This becomes an important factor in the design andoperation of the atmospheric crude distillation unit. The stripped residue leaves thebottom of the unit to be routed either through the unit’ s heat exchanger system andthe to product storage or hot to some down stream processing unit such as a vacuumdistillation unit or a thermal cracker.
The development of the material balance for the atmospheric crude
distillation unit
The knowledge of the material balance in any reﬁning process is important both for
ensuring its proper design and later for its proper operation. Because of the relativenumber of streams involved this is particularly so in the case of the atmospheric crudedistillation unit. The operation of this unit also is critical to the performance of downstream units such as catalytic crackers and catalytic reformers. The material balancefor any speciﬁc operation required of the unit, (for example, maximizing naphtha feedto the catalytic reformer), from a particular crude feed source also sets the performanceparameters of the unit. This includes the amount of reﬂux to be generated, at whichsection this reﬂux is to be generated, distillate draw-off temperatures, tower overheadconditions, ﬂash zone conditions and the like.
Whole crude TBP curve and assay data
The development of the unit’ s material balance begins with an ‘in depth’ examination
and analysis of the crude oil feed’ s assay. The ﬁrst step in doing this activity is to116 CHAPTER 3
Figure 3.3. Boiling points V’ s molecular weight and gravity (◦API).
break up the crude feed’ s TBP distillation curve into its pseudo components and to
assign the product characteristics relative to each component’ s mid boiling point ormid volume point on crude.
The properties of each pseudo component are provided either by the assay data giving
the gravity versus mid volume percent (or mid boiling point), and by the applicationof Figure 3.3. This chart gives the component’ s molecular weight based on boilingpoint (i.e., mid boiling point) and its gravity in
◦API. Every care must be made to
establish these properties as accurately as possible. It will form the basis of any designprocess or deﬁnitive study work that may be carried out on this unit.THE ATMOSPHERIC AND V ACUUM CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS 117
Developing the side stream product TBPs
The ﬁrst step is to divide the crude feed’ s TBP curve into the product yield (inpercent volume) and in terms of that product’ s temperature cut range. This starts withestablishing the cut point of the residue. That is the temperature on the TBP curve atwhich it is intended to separate the total distillate from the residue. Then the distillateportion of the TBP is divided into its product cuts such as Gas Oils, Kerosene, and thetotal overhead Naphtha, or some other combination of products. The volume of thesecuts and temperature ranges represent the yield of each product that will be producedas a percentage of the whole crude.
From the cut points of each of the products their ASTM curves are developed using
the method described in Chapter 1. The initial boiling point (IBP) of each cut (exceptthe overhead Naphtha) is ﬁxed by the fractionation capability of the distillation unit.This term ‘fractionation capability’ for a crude oil distillation unit is measured as thedifference in temperature between the 95% volume point of the lighter cut’ s ASTMdistillation and the 5% volume point of the adjacent heavier cut. This differencemay be positive (Gap) or negative (Overlap). A gap indicates good separation whilethe overlap indicates poor separation. The ability to separate the fractions efﬁcientlydecreases as the products become heavier. Thus, one can expect an ASTM gap betweenthe overhead product and the ﬁrst side stream to be around 25
◦F , while that between a
third and fourth side stream to have an ASTM gap around −10◦F (an overlap of 10◦F).
The side stream TBP curves are now developed using these concepts and followingthese stepwise procedures.
Step 1. Establish the cuts and cut ranges on the crude TBP that represents the products
that will be produced in this unit. For example—The overhead product will be a
full range naphtha and will contain all the gas in the crude and the distillate to acut point of 400
◦F . The ﬁrst side stream will be a Kerosene cut beginning at 400
and ending at 500◦F on the crude TBP curve. The next side stream will be a gas
oil boiling between 500 and 650◦F on the TBP curve. These will have yields as %
volume on crude from the TBP curve. As an example typical cuts are given asFigure 3.4.From this ﬁgure:
Naphtha (gas to 400"
"◦F)=30 %vol on crude.
Kerosene (400–500◦F)=10.5 %vol on crude.
Gas oil (500–650◦F)=14.5 %vol on crude.
Residue (+650) =45.0 %vol on crude.
Step 2. Predict the ASTM end point and the ASTM 90% point using the ﬁgures
given in Chapter 1 of this Handbook for the full range Naphtha (i.e., the overhead
product).118 CHAPTER 3

Step 3. Plot these on the probability chart, also given in Chapter 1 and draw the straight
line through the 30 %vol point. This will be sufﬁcient to determine a meaningful
ASTM curve from which a TBP curve can be produced.
Step 4. The ASTM curves for the remaining side stream products are developed using
the curves in Chapter 1 for ﬁxing their ASTM end points. The 5% points on bothTHE ATMOSPHERIC AND V ACUUM CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS 119
ASTM curves are then ﬁxed using a reasonable ASTM Gap or overlap between the
products thus:
Step 5. The 5% ASTM point for the kerosene cut will be the 95% point of the full
range naphtha plus 25◦F gap. Similarly the 5% ASTM point for the gas oil will be
the 95% point of the kerosene plus a 0◦F gap.
Step 6. The ASTM curves for the side streams are drawn as straight lines on the
probability chart between their respective end points and their predicted 5% points.
Step 7. Convert the developed ASTM curves to TBP curves using the Edmister cor-
relations and as described in Chapter 1.
Step 8. Extend the front end of the full naphtha to include the gas portion and the light
distillate below the 30 %vol point. Step this section off in mid boiling points tosimulate real hydrocarbon components such as C5’ s, C6, C7, etc. This will becomeimportant later in establishing the reﬂux drum pressure and temperature.
An example of this method is given later in the worked example of an AtmosphericCrude Distillation Unit process design.
Developing the product volume, mass, mol balance
Using the component breakdown ( pseudo components) and the product TBP curves,
calculate each product volume rate, mass rate, and mole rates using the followingsteps:
Step 1. Establish the crude feed ﬂow rate in terms of volume (usually BPSD), then
calculate its mass ﬂow (say in lbs/hour) and molal ﬂow, using the crude feed
breakdown table described in the previous section.
Step 2. Develop each products’ speciﬁc gravity using its component composition and
each component’ s speciﬁc gravity as given in the Crude Breakdown Table.
Step 3. Develop each product’ s mol weight similar to step 2 and again referencing the
Crude Breakdown Table. There is relationship between gravity, boiling point, andmole weight. This is given in Figure 3.3.
Step 4. From the data developed in steps 2 and 3 calculate the quantity of each product
in terms of BPSD, lbs/hr, moles/hr. The sum of each of these product quantitiesmust equal the quantity of the crude oil feed calculated in Step 1.
This completes the description of the material balance development.
The design characteristics of an atmospheric crude distillation
fractionating tower
In modern day reﬁning the separation of the basic products from the crude feed
is generally accomplished in a single atmospheric distillation tower. There are cir-cumstances however that lead to the use of two towers to accomplish this. These120 CHAPTER 3
circumstances usually occur where there is an abnormally high quantity of light com-
ponents in the feed (such as crude spiked with naphtha) or where the unit capacityrevamp calls for such a conﬁguration. In these circumstances a light cut is ﬂashed offand fractionated in a ‘Primary’ tower. The bottoms from this tower is then heated andvaporized to enter the ﬂash zone of a ‘Secondary’ tower where it is fractionated tomeet the conventional overhead, and side distillate products.
This section of this chapter will deal only with the single atmospheric crude distillation
process however.
The tower ﬂash zone
As described earlier the crude oil feed is heated to its required temperature for
separating its distillate products from the unvaporized portion (i.e., the residue)by heat exchange with products being cooled or condensed and ﬁnally by a ﬁredheater. This heated crude enters a section of the atmospheric fractionating tower ata point below the fractionating trays. This section of the tower is called The FlashZone. The temperature and pressure conditions in this zone are such as to allowthe correct amount of vapor to be ﬂashed from the heated crude to provide thequantities of the distillate product streams and the internal reﬂux to control theirquality.
These ﬂash zone conditions of temperature and pressure are determined taking into"
"consideration the shape of the crude oil’ s equilibrium ﬂash vaporization (EFV) curve,the pressure (usually the partial pressure in the case of the atmospheric tower) existingin this section of the tower and the temperature on the EFV corresponding to thevolume % cut of the total vapor to be ﬂashed.
Setting the ﬂash zone partial pressure
Because steam is used to strip the residue leaving the tower free of light ends this steamenters the ﬂash zone from the top stripping tray. The steam inﬂuences the pressurecondition at which the hydrocarbon vapors separate from the residue. This pressurecondition is the partial pressure exerted by the steam. It is calculated by the equationas follows:
Partial pressure of HC vapor =moles HC vapor
moles HC vapor + moles steam×Total pressure
The total pressure of the ﬂash zone is determined by the pressure in the tower’ soverhead reﬂux drum plus the pressure drop over the overhead condenser(s), and theTHE ATMOSPHERIC AND V ACUUM CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS 121
total distillate trays and internals above the ﬂash zone. For an estimate of the ﬂash
zone partial pressure the following rules of thumb may be considered:
Overhead reﬂux drum pressure 5 psig
Pressure drop over the condensers 7 psiPressure drop over trays etc 10 psi (assumes 40 trays @ 0.25 psi per tray)Assume /Delta1P over internals are negligible
Then total pressure 22 psig.
Assume that the steam from the residue stripper will be 1.2 lbs/hot gallon of residue.
Setting the ﬂash zone temperature
Calculate the EFV of the whole crude using the method described in Chapter 1 of thisHandbook. This EFV curve is at atmospheric pressure. The temperature of the ﬂashat atmospheric pressure is read off as the % volume vaporized to meet the amount ofdistillate products andthe over ﬂash required by the process. This over ﬂash is usually
ﬁxed at between 3 and 5% volume on crude. Its purpose in the process is to providethat extra heat in order to generate sufﬁcient reﬂux down ﬂow over the trays to satisfythe prescribed degree of separation between the products.
This atmospheric ﬂash temperature is now adjusted to the temperature at the previously
calculated partial pressure existing in the ﬂash zone. This may be done by reading thetemperature at the partial pressure using the PVT curve shown as Figure 1.A.1 in theappendix to this chapter. This is the ﬂash zone temperature.
Other features of the ﬂash zone section
Most crude oils contain sulfur in some form or other and organic chlorides which arenot removed in the pre-treating desalter. Corrosion from these impurities is particularlyvirulent in mixed phases (liquid/vapor) and at the elevated temperature experiencedin the unit’ s ﬂash zone, and made more so by the presence of steam. A cladding of11/13 chrome is usually applied as a protective cover over the tower’ s carbon shellin this section. This cladding should be extended also to include the residue stripperand the section of the tower containing the ﬁrst 4–6 wash trays above the ﬂash zone.These trays and the residue stripping trays should also be of 11/13 chrome alloy.
Effective separation of the distillate vapor phase and the unvaporized residue phase
is enhanced by the inclusion of a ‘swirl’ at the inlet of the ﬂash zone. The crude fromthe ﬁred heater is routed through this ‘swirl’ which is an inverted trough and extendsaround 2/3rds of the tower circumference. The swirling action caused by this forcedﬂow of the mixed phases allows the lighter vapor phase to separate to a large extentfrom the heavier liquid phase. The ﬁnal separation occurs on the top stripping tray.122 CHAPTER 3
The fractionator overhead system
The fractionator overhead equipment has four functions. These are:
rTo condense the overhead vapors including the stripping steam
rTo return and control the reﬂux condensate to the tower
rTo collect and dispatch the overhead product
rTo separate and dispose of the condensed steam
These functions are accomplished in several different ways. Some of these overhead
conﬁgurations are described in the following paragraphs.
Conﬁguration 1
This is probably the most common system and is shown in Figure 3.5.The total overhead vapor leaves the top of the tower at its dew point. It ﬁrst enters"
"a shell and tube exchanger where it is partially condensed. The cooling medium iscold crude oil feed from storage. The partially condensed overhead leaves the shellside of this crude oil exchanger to be further and totally condensed by either a trimwater cooler or, more usually an air condenser. The condensate from this ﬁnal con-denser enters an overhead condensate drum. This drum is designed to allow thecomplete separation of the condensed steam in the overheads from the hydrocarboncondensate. This condensed aqueous phase is collected in a ‘boot’ located belowthe main condensate drum and is pumped under level control to the reﬁnery’ s sourwater disposal system. A portion of the hydrocarbon phase is pumped to back to thefractionating tower to enter above the top tray. This stream is usually ﬂow controlledwhich is reset by a tower top temperature control. The stream enters the tower througha spray system designed to ensure good distribution over the top tray.

The remaining hydrocarbon condensate leaves the drum under level control and is
pumped to storage or a downstream process plant. The operating temperature andpressure of the condensate drum is vital to the operation of the fractionating tower.These conditions set the parameters for ﬂash zone operation and intermediate productdraw-off temperatures. These conditions are set and operated as follows.
The drum pressure. This is maintained by two pressure control valves operating on a
split ﬂow control. One of the valves is connected to the reﬁnery ﬂare while the other
is connected to the unit’ s fuel gas supply. When the pressure in the drum exceeds thepressure set point of the controller, the ﬁrst valve opens to the ﬂare thus reducing thedrum pressure. When the pressure falls below the set point then fuel gas is introducedby the second valve to correct this condition.
The drum temperature. The drum temperature is held at the bubble point of the
condensate or slightly super cooled. This temperature is controlled either by fan pitch
or by louvres on the ﬁnal air condenser. Should the ﬁnal condenser be a shell and tubewater trim exchanger then a bypass of the condensate around the exchanger activatedby a temperature/ﬂow control is installed. Such an arrangement can also be used onan air condenser.
The tower overhead temperature. The tower overhead temperature in this conﬁgu-
ration is the dew point of the overhead product vapor at the partial pressure of the
hydrocarbon.
Note: The partial pressure for this case is the total moles of hydrocarbons (includes
the Reﬂux moles) divide by the total moles of vapor (includes the steam present)
times the total overhead pressure.
The tower overhead pressure. The overhead tower pressure in this case is the pressure
of the overhead condensate drum plus the pressure drops of the heat exchangers, and
the associated overhead condensate piping. This pressure drop may be taken as 7–9 psi.
Conﬁguration 2This second conﬁguration is usually installed on units of high capacity at throughputs
above 70,000 BPSD. Its purpose is to maintain the size of the overhead equipmentto manageable dimensions. This includes drums and the heat exchangers associatedwith the system (Figure 3.6).
In this conﬁguration the total overhead vapors are again condensed by two exchangers
as described in Conﬁguration 1. In this second case, however, the condensate from theﬁrst condenser is collected in a drum and returned to the tower as reﬂux. The vaporfrom this ﬁrst drum includes the overhead product hydrocarbon and the uncondensed124 CHAPTER 3

steam from the fractionator. This vapor is condensed in the second overhead condenser
(again usually an air condenser) to be collected in a second condensate drum asthe overhead distillate product and water. Disposal of the separated aqueous andhydrocarbon streams follow the same system as in Conﬁguration number 1. In thisconﬁguration the reﬂux drum acts as an additional theoretical tray because the reﬂuxliquid is in phase equilibrium with the product vapor.
The product drum pressure and temperature. This again is the controlling pressure
for the fractionator as a whole. It is set at the pressure which allows the vapors to
be condensed at a reasonable temperature at or below its bubble point. In moderateclimates with average air temperatures of 60
◦F this temperature will be around 90–
100◦F with a pressure of 5 psig. Control of the drum pressure and temperature remains
the same as that for conﬁguration 1.
The reﬂux drum temperature. The conditions in this drum may be considered as those
for the top tray of the tower in Conﬁguration 1. The temperature therefore is the dew"
"point of the product distillate at the partial pressure of the hydrocarbons vapors leavingthe drum. This temperature is usually controlled by a vapor bypass over the exchangeron a ﬂow reset by temperature control valve. Alternatively it may be controlled by thecrude oil being bypassed on a similar ﬂow/temperature reset basis. The partial pressurein this case is the moles of product vapor only divided by the total moles (includingthe steam) times the total absolute pressure. This total pressure is the pressure in thedistillate product drum (say 5 psig) plus the pressure drop of the air condenser andpiping (say about 3 psi).
The tower overhead temperature and pressure. The tower top conditions in the case of
this second conﬁguration is calculated as the dew point of the reﬂux stream enteringTHE ATMOSPHERIC AND V ACUUM CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS 125

the tower from the reﬂux drum. This temperature will be at the partial pressure of the
total hydrocarbons leaving the tower.
Conﬁguration 3
In this conﬁguration the Tower itself is used to generate the internal reﬂux from the
overhead product (Figure 3.7).
In this conﬁguration the reﬂux is generated by a pump around system taking the liquid
from the top section of the tower, and cooling it by heat exchange with cold crude oil.This cooled stream is then returned to the top tray of the tower. This is a conventionalpump around system. About three trays are used for this pump around section in thetower. The tower top temperature remains as the dew point of the overhead productdistillate at its partial pressure with steam. The temperature of the liquid leavingthe tower as the pump around will be between 5 and 7
◦F higher than the tower top
temperature. The internal pump around section may be assumed to be equivalent toone half an actual tray for mass transfer.
Discussion
All three of these conﬁgurations have their advantages and disadvantages. These are
discussed brieﬂy in the following paragraphs:126 CHAPTER 3
Conﬁguration 1. As said earlier this is the most common conﬁguration. It is relatively
easy to control with really only two set points that one has to be concerned with. They
are the drum pressure and the tower overhead temperature. There is good heat transferbetween the condensing vapors and the crude oil. The overall heat transfer coefﬁcientis high at around 70–80 Btu/hr/sqft/
◦F and advantage is taken in the LMTD of the latent
heat of the vapors being transferred to the low temperature of the incoming crude.The biggest disadvantage with this system is that the crude to the ﬁrst condenser is ofcourse at a much higher pressure than the vapors condensing on the shell side. Therupture of a tube in the exchanger bundle or a leak in the tube plate will cause crudeto contaminate the overhead product and ‘dirty’ the tower overhead trays. This can bequite a disaster if the downstream units (particularly the Cat Reformer) is fed directlyfrom the condensate drum without some intermediate surge drum or tankage.
Conﬁguration 2. This has the advantage of providing a very high LMTD in con-
densing with heat exchange against crude. This is due to the higher temperature now
experienced in the vapors leaving the tower. As in the case of conﬁguration 1, theoverall heat transfer coefﬁcient in this case is also high. There still remains thoughthe problem of contamination but in this case downstream units have a measure ofprotection in that only the vapors from the reﬂux drum are condensed to make theproduct. The top trays of the tower however will be contaminated as before. The twodrum system’ s biggest advantage however is more aligned to the installed cost of theunit. Moderately sized equipment are much cheaper than large items which may haveto be ﬁeld fabricated. Cost savings may in any case be achieved in the transportationcosts of the drums and heat exchangers.
Conﬁguration 3. The only major advantage in this conﬁguration is that the liquid
pumparound can be circulated at a higher pressure than the incoming crude. Thus,
the problem associated with tube fracture or leakage contaminating the tower andproduct is eliminated. There is also an advantage in better control of the tower toptemperature by the ﬂow control of the pumparound itself. This too can be resetby temperature, but as an ex plant operator the author is not particularly in favorof temperature reset as a ﬁnite means of control. There is no other apparent advantageto this system. Indeed the inclusion of additional trays in the tower for the pumparoundis quite expensive. The trays would need to be of monel and some monel lining of theshell will be required in this section as protection against chloride attack.
Some design considerationsCorrosion"
"The top section of the atmospheric distillation tower is very prone to corrosion fromHCl. To combat this corrosion and to protect the carbon steel shell from damagemonel is used in tray manufacture and as lining for the tower shell. This material isalso used to line the ﬁrst condenser shell interior and the tubes may also be fabricatedTHE ATMOSPHERIC AND V ACUUM CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS 127
in monel. Ammonia either in its anhydrous form or as a solution, is injected into the
tower top and at speciﬁc intervals into the top section tray spaces. The purpose of theammonia is to neutralize as far as possible the HCl. The injection of the ammonia iscontrolled by the Ph reading of the condensate water leaving the boot of the productcondensate drum.
Corrosion is most virulent at the liquid interface on trays. Consequently in most
modern fractionating towers monel lining of the shell is usually applied as strips onthe top four or six trays. These strips installed at the interface of the liquid/vaporon these trays the strips will be about 4–6 ins wide. The injection of anhydrousammonia in the case of conﬁguration number 2 does cause problems in the formationof ammonium chloride crystals occurring in the ‘dry’ section of the condenser system.That is the section where the hydrocarbon is condensing but the steam is still in itsvapor phase. The injection of aqueous ammonia solution instead of the anhydrousform solves this problem.
Sulfur compounds are also a problem with respect to corrosion particularly in the
‘cold’ liquid phase of the distillate product drum. The drum shell in this case isgunnite lined. This lining is applied to the bottom section of the main drum andextended to include the ‘boot’ in which the condensed water is concentrated. Gunniteis best described as a cement lining and is applied in the same way as refractory lining,by plastering it on to the shell.
The distillate drum
The design of the distillate drum includes space for the complete separation of theaqueous phase (condensed steam) from the hydrocarbon phase. It is important forthe hydrocarbons to be as free of water as possible to protect the downstream units.The performance of these units such as hydro-treaters and, more particularly thecatalytic reformer are badly effected by the presence of water in their feed streams.
The design of the drum to allow this separation is based on one of three laws. These
laws are expressed by the following equations:
Stoke’ s Law: V=8.3×10

Lighter phase Heavy phase Minimum droplet size
0.850 Sc and lighter Water 0.008 inches
Heavier than 0.850 Water 0.005 inches
Piping
Vapor piping from the tower top should be sized for a minimum economic pressuredrop. As a guide vapor rundown lines should be sized to meet an average pressuredrop of 0.2 psi per 100 ft and should never exceed 0.5 psi/100 ft. The vapor (and mixedphase) piping and the drums in the tower overhead system should be so arrange as toallow free drainage towards the distillate drum (or in the case of conﬁguration 2 toeach successive drum). The vapor lines should never be pocketed.
Distillate drums should be located at least 15 ft above the center line of the respective
distillate/reﬂux and the sour water pumps (pumps are normally located at grade). Forsafety this measurement should be taken from the bottom tangent line of the vessel.Piping to the pump should be sized for a 0.25 psi/100 ft pressure drop, while thedischarge piping from the pump may be reduced to meet a pressure drop of 2.5–4.0 psi/100 ft.
The side streams and intermediate reﬂux sections
There are generally two or three side streams in the atmospheric crude distillation
unit. There may be one more but a total of three side streams is the norm. The unit,that is going to be developed as an example in this work, has three side streams. Theseare:
rKerosene
rLight gas oil
rHeavy gas oil.THE ATMOSPHERIC AND V ACUUM CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS 129
With three side streams there will be usually two pumparound sections. The purpose"
"of these pumparound sections is to create the proper internal reﬂux to that section ofthe tower below the location of the respective pumparound. The pumparound takessuction from a draw-off tray in the tower. Usually this tray is also a product drawoff. The pump delivers the pumparound stream through a heat exchanger where it iscooled before returning it to a location in the tower about two to three trays above thedraw-off tray. This cooling liquid ﬂowing down the tower to the draw-off tray acts asan internal condenser. The hot vapors rising up the tower through the draw-off traycontain the side stream product, some internal overﬂow and the vapor phase of all thelighter products and their overﬂow. This particular side stream product and overﬂowis selectively condensed by the cold pumparound. It enters the draw-off tray wherethe product quantity and pumparound leave the tower, and the remaining condensateoverﬂows to the tray below the draw off. This over ﬂow material is the internal reﬂuxstream and its quantity determines the fractionation between this lighter side streamproduct and the heavier side stream product drawn from the tower at some point below.
The side streamsSide streams are withdrawn from selective and specially designed trays in the main
tower. Each stream is usually combined with the respective pump around as describedearlier. When withdrawn from the tower the product is in equilibrium with the totalvapor rising through the draw-off tray. Consequently the product liquid will contain en-trained light ends which will affect the required product properties such as ﬂash pointand its ASTM distillation. To correct this the side stream product is steam stripped ina separate trayed stripping column. This arrangement is shown in Figure 3.8.
The side stream from the main tower is routed to a distributor over the top tray of the
stripping column under level control. The stripping column contains four strippingtrays. Steam is introduced below the bottom tray and ﬂows up the tower counter currentto the liquid product. The light ends contained in the stripper feed are removed by thesteam and both the stripout and steam leave the top of the stripper to enter the maintower at the vapor space directly above the draw-off tray.
The stripped product leaves the well at the bottom of the stripper to be pumped under
ﬂow control to storage or a downstream unit’ s surge drum. The level in the well of thestripper activates the level control valve of the incoming stripper feed.
The side stream draw-off temperature. In theory the side stream product draw off from
the main column will be in equilibrium with the vapor rising from the tray. In other
words it will be at its bubble temperature at the partial pressure of the hydrocarbonson the tray. However, this liquid phase will contain some entrained light ends (Thusthe need for steam stripping) which will affect the actual temperature of the draw off.J. W .

takes into consideration this difference between the theoretical draw-off temperature
and the actual. This curve is given as Figure 3.9.
In arriving at the partial pressure in this calculation Packie assumes that all the vapor
lighter than the draw-off is inert. With this as a parameter the draw-off temperaturecan be calculated using the following step wise process:
Step 1. Fix the amount of steam present in the vapor passing through the draw-off
tray (Note: This does not include the steam returning from the particular draw-
off stripper which enters the vapor space above the draw-off tray). The amountof stripping steam recommended is given in Figure 3.10.
Step 2. Fix the total pressure on the tray taking the estimated tower top pressure and
each tray pressure drop above the draw-off tray (see the previous paragraphs onﬂash zone and overhead system). Estimate the position of the draw-off tray. As aguide the following rule of thumb can be used. With tray 1 as the top tray in thecolumn:

There are usually 40 fractionating trays (i.e. Trays above the ﬂash zone) and 4"
"bottom stripping trays in conventional distillation towers. These amounts will bechecked later using the relationship of reﬂux to tray ratio for fractionation criteria.
Step 3. Calculate the FRL (Flash Reference Line) for the draw off TBP cut. In doing
this use the TBP cut; not the TBP end points. This calculation has been describedunder the section on the Flash Zone. Establish its IBP at atmospheric pressure. Thiswill be the 0 %vol temperature on the FRL.
Step 4. Predict the amount of overﬂow that will leave the draw-off tray as a liquid
reﬂux to the tray below. Again this will be checked by the relationship of trays andreﬂux later. For this calculation the following rules of thumb for the ratio of molesoverﬂow to moles product may be used:
Overﬂow from the HGO draw off 2.9Overﬂow from the LGO draw off 1.2Overﬂow from the Kero draw off 0.9 to 1.0
Step 5. Calculate the partial pressure on the draw-off tray as follows:

Step 6. Using the vapor pressure curves (given in the appendix as Figure 1.A.1)
Relate the IBP of the cut at atmospheric pressure (step 3) to the calculated partial
pressure.
Step 7. The temperature arrived at in Step 6 is the theoretical temperature of a liquid
in equilibrium with its associate vapor phase. In actual practice the fact that a vaporphase has been continually bubbling through the liquid on the tray, that liquid willcontain entrained light ends from the vapor. The actual temperature will thereforebe somewhat lower than the calculated, and this difference is provided by Figure 3.9.Establish the actual temperature of the side stream draw off. Note this will also bethe temperature of the pumparound liquid also.
Side stream stripping. The side stream enters a steam stripper at the draw-off temper-
ature. It is steam stripped and the amount of stripping steam and the correspondingstrip out may be read off from Figure 3.10. The steam introduced below the bottomstripping tray is usually superheated at 50 psig. The temperature of the stripout andTHE ATMOSPHERIC AND V ACUUM CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS 133
steam leaving the top of the stripper to enter the main tower can be taken as 5◦F
below the temperature of the stripper feed. The mol weight of the stripout is taken
as the average of the vapors lighter than the draw off. A heat balance can now becarried out over the stripper with an unknown being the stripped product enthalpy andtemperature. The product outlet temperature and enthalpy is calculated. By solvingthe equation:
Heat in =Heat out.
Side stream strippers for each product draw off are usually stacked in one singlecolumn. It becomes an exercise in layout to locate these stripper sections. It beginswith establishing the height of the bottom stripper section which will ensure sufﬁcienthead to provide available NPSH for the product rundown pump. Thereafter eachsuccessive section is located to ensure free ﬂow of the liquid feed into the respectivestripper, and to minimize the length of the vapor return line to the main tower.
The pump arounds
The mechanism of the pumparounds and their purpose has already been described
and discussed. It remains now to examine how to evaluate and detail quantitativelytheir size in terms of the duty they will be required to perform. This will be followedwith some criteria that need to be observed in their design.
Total pumparound duties. This begins by establishing the Tower bottom temperature
(Residue outlet temperature) and then conducting an overall Tower heat balance. To
calculate the Tower bottom temperature consider the following diagram (Figure 3.11):
And then the following calculation steps:
Step 1. Establish the material entering the top stripping tray. This will be the total
residue product which now includes the overﬂash as a liquid, and the stripout
material (also as liquid). This is taken as being at the ﬂash zone temperature.
Step 2. Calculate the total heat input to the bottom stripper. This will include the heat
into the top stripping tray plus the heat in the stripping steam (enters below thebottom tray).
Step 3. Calculate the heat out of the stripper. This includes the bottom product at an
unknown temperature and enthalpy, the stripout from the top stripping tray, and thesteam from the top stripping tray. Assume the stripout and the steam will be at 5
◦F
below the ﬂash zone temperature and the steam will be at the ﬂash zone partialpressure for the steam.
Step 4. From the equation
Heat in =Heat out134 CHAPTER 3

calculate the Enthalpy (in Btu/lb) and thus the temperature of the residue or bottom
product leaving the tower.
Note: While the author uses enthalpy data from his own ﬁles, it is recommendedthat engineers use their own proven data from their own ﬁles, or data contained inMaxwell’ s Hydrocarbon Data, or those given in the GPSA Engineering Data Book.
With all the temperature and enthalpy criteria established an overall heat balanceover the tower can proceed. In this balance the heat in with the crude will be thatfor the overﬂashed crude at the ﬂash zone temperature. The other heat inputs arethe steam streams to the various strippers. The heat out will consist of the overheaddistillate product at the distillate drum temperature, the overhead condenser(s) duty,the condensed steam, all the side streams and residue as liquid and at their respectivestripper bottom temperature, and ﬁnally the total of the pumparound duty.
As all the Enthalpy duties are known except that for the pumparound this can now be
calculated from the expression
Heat in =Heat out.
Distributing the total pumparound to meet the required internal reﬂux
The degree of separation of one product from an adjacent one is determined by, the
number of fractionating trays used for the separation and the liquid overﬂow (Reﬂux)THE ATMOSPHERIC AND V ACUUM CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS 135
entering the section used for the separation. As has been said previously the degree
of separation of products in the Atmospheric Crude Distillation tower is measuredby the difference between the 95 %vol point of the lighter fraction and the 5 %volpoint of the heavier fraction as measured by their ASTM distillation curve. Packiedeveloped a relationship between the ASTM distillation difference, the number oftrays, and the amount of overﬂow in terms of internal reﬂux ratio. This relationship isgiven by a series of curves in the appendix to this chapter (Figure 1.A.2). The use ofthese curves is illustrated by the following stepwise calculation procedure to arriveat the amount of overﬂow liquid.
Step 1. Establish the ASTM gap (or overlap) that is required. This is usually given
in the design speciﬁcation of the unit or by some constraint on one or other of the
products. It is well to note here that ASTM gaps can usually be achieved betweenproducts lighter than light gas oil. Gaps can rarely be achieved within the towerfor products heavier than the light gas oil cut. To trim the front or back endsof heavy products may require additional equipment such as vacuum ﬂash equi-pment.
Step 2. Establish the number of trays separating the two adjacent products. This
has usually been ﬁxed by the design of the tower in operating units. For designpurposes the following Fractionating number of trays can be used as a start point andguide:
Tray number
Top tray 1Kero draw off 12LGO PA return 19LGO draw off 22HGO PA return 29HGO draw off 32
As a rule of thumb the section of trays for the pumparound may be counted as one
fractionating tray. Thus for example 10 +1 trays can be counted for the separation
of Kero and LGO.
Step 3. Evaluate the 50 %vol temperature difference between the TBP of the two
adjacent cuts.
Step 4. Using the side stream to side stream family of curves in Figure 3.A.2 for max
steam read off the factor corresponding to the ASTM difference required on theappropriate /Delta150% TBP temperature curve.
Step 5. The factor read is the number of trays separating the two products’ draw-off
multiplied by the Reﬂux ratio. This Reﬂux ratio is deﬁned as:
Hot overﬂow in gallons per hour leaving the lightest product draw-off tray
Total product gallons per hour entering the lightest product draw-off tray.136 CHAPTER 3
Equate to determine the overﬂow quantity, in hot gallons per hour. The units material
balance is used to resolve the ﬂows to lbs per hour.
It now only remains to utilize the overﬂow criteria in the overall tower heat balance to
arrive at a duty for the respective pumparound. If there is only one other pumparoundin the tower it can be determined by subtraction of the calculated pumparound fromthe total PA duty. Should there be more than two pumparounds involved then thecalculation steps given above must be repeated for the second one, and the thirdobtained by subtraction.
On completion of setting the individual pumparound duties as described the items
determined by subtraction must be checked to ensure that they do in fact generateenough overﬂow to meet the fractionation criteria. If they do not fulﬁll this then theoverall pump: around duty must be increased. This can be achieved only by increas-ing over ﬂash if the cut points are to remain the same. Should the check calculationsshow there is somewhat more internal reﬂux than required, providing it is not exces-sive, it should remain as is. If it is excessive the over ﬂash can be reduced accord-ingly.
Checking the number of trays allocated to the pumparound"
"With the individual pumparound duties now established, the temperatures to and from
the pumparound section trays are the next items to be ﬁxed. Use the following stepsto accomplish this:
Step 1. Draw the tower temperature proﬁle from the ﬂash zone to the tower top tray.
Use the already calculated side stream draw-off temperatures for this.
Step 2. Assume the vapor temperature to a tray is the liquid temperature on the
tray below it. This is a reasonable assumption and well within the accuracy re-
quired.
Step 3. Fix the pumparound inlet temperature. This will need to be a guess at this
point, and may well change on completion of the heat exchange system calcula-tions. From the pumparound duty calculate the ﬂow of pumparound liquid in lbs perhour.
Step 4. Carry out a heat balance over the pumparound section of the tower. This will
now include the following items:
Heat in
With the HC vapor from the tray below the section (includes the overﬂow).
With steam from the tray below the section.With steam and strip out from the product stripper (if applicable).With the pumparound return liquid.THE ATMOSPHERIC AND V ACUUM CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS 137
Heat out
With lighter product vapors rising from the top PA tray.
Total steam from ﬂash zone and side stream strippers below top PA tray.Liquid pumparound leaving the tower.Liquid product draw off plus strip out leaving to stripper (if applicable).Liquid overﬂow from the PA draw-off tray.The pumparound duty in Btu/hr.
In these items the only unknown is the enthalpy and therefore the temperature ofthe vapor leaving the top pumparound tray. Equate Heat in = Heat out to solve theunknown.
Step 5. With the duty of the pumparound section in Btu/hr and the temperatures in
and out now known, the pumparound section can be treated as a heat exchanger.The area of heat transfer will be the total tray areas of the section, and the heattransfer coefﬁcient in terms of Btu/hr/sqft/
◦F is given in Figure 3.12.
Step 6. The area is now calculated from the heat transfer equation;
Q=UA /Delta1tm
where
Q=Heat transferred in Btu/hr
U=The overall heat transfer coefﬁcient in Btu/hr/sqft/◦F
A=Heat transfer area in sqft.
/Delta1tm=Log mean temperature difference in◦F.
Step 7. The number of trays required will be determined from the tray or tower di-
ameter calculation provided by a future calculation to determine the tower dimens-ions.
Calculating the main tower dimensions
Having established the number of trays and the relative location of pumparound and
side stream draw off, the overall dimensions of the tower can be calculated. Note: Thenumber of trays allocated to the pumparound sections may be revised based on the trayor tower diameter calculation for those sections. This will not affect the tray loadingcalculations which will determine the tray diameters. The calculation to determine thetower diameter(s) is based on the vapor/liquid loading on each section of the tower.This loading is based on a series of heat balances to determine this trafﬁc to and fromthe critical trays. These critical trays are:
rThe top stripping tray of the residue stripping section (below the ﬂash zone)
rThe bottom side stream and pumparound draw-off tray
rThe next pumparound draw-off (and the side stream if applicable) tray138 CHAPTER 3
Figure 3.12. Overall heat transfer coefﬁcients in oil reﬁning.
rAny other lighter pumparound draw-off tray
rAny lighter side stream draw-off tray
rThe top tray
The loading below the bottom pumparound and product draw-off gives the vapor
loading for setting the maximum tower cross sectional area and diameter. This is ﬁxed
by the crude feed cut point and the degree of over ﬂash.THE ATMOSPHERIC AND V ACUUM CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS 139

Calculating the tower vapor and liquid loading
These loadings at the critical trays are calculated from a series of heat balances starting
at the bottom stripping section and continuing up the tower to the top fractionationtray. Consider the loading on the bottom side stream and pumparound draw-off tray.This commences with a heat balance from below this tray and includes the streamsshown in the envelop in Figure 3.23.
The heat into and out of the envelope as shown is provided by the following streams:
Heat in: The crude vapor and liquid feed at the ﬂash zone conditions.
The steam to the residue stripper.
The overﬂow liquid from the draw-off tray.
Heat out: The residue product.
The vapor of the total distillate products from the tray below the draw off.The overﬂow vapor from the tray below.The steam from the ﬂash zone at the conditions of the tray below."
"The temperature and quantities of these streams are known (from the material balance),except the quantity of overﬂow. Their temperatures are also known from the towertemperature proﬁle or from previous calculations. To complete the calculation let the140 CHAPTER 3
lbs of overﬂow be xand give all the streams their enthalpy value. Then solve the
equation:
Heat in =Heat out
to ﬁnd the value of x.
Repeat the heat balance calculation for the envelop ending below the next pumparound
draw-off tray. In this case the vapor leaving the envelop will contain the overﬂow vaporfrom the pumparound tray, and all the distillate products except the heavier productdrawn off from the pumparound tray below. It will also contain all the steam from theﬂash zone andfrom the side stream stripper of the heavier product. The remaining heat
out of the envelope will be the stripped heavier product and the bottom pumparoundduty in Btu/hr. The heat into the envelope will be as before except this time theunknown overﬂow quantity will be that ﬂowing from the lighter pumparound draw-off tray. It will also include the steam from the heavier product side stream stripper.
The tower diameter. The tower diameter may now be calculated from the vapor ﬂow
to the tray and the total liquid load on the tray. The quantity of the vapor to the tray
has already been established. The liquid load on the tray will be:
The product draw-off liquid.
The pumparound liquid.The calculated over ﬂow liquid.
These quantities must be in terms of weight and volume at the tray conditions of
temperature and pressure.
The calculation procedure and data described below will give a good estimate of the
tower diameter. For design purposes however the tray fabricator/designer’ s data and
procedure should be used. Trays are usually proprietary items covered by patents,their performance therefore are subject to guarantees.
A calculation procedure to estimate the tower diameter is as follows:
Step 1. Summarize the liquid trafﬁc through the tray.
Step 2. Select the type of tray that is to be considered for the design. (in the case
of an existing unit refer to the fabricators drawings). Valve and sieve trays have
reasonable similarity in their major characteristics. Bubble cap trays are seldomused these days. A table of the valve tray characteristics is given in the appendixas A.1.3.
Step 3. Compute the liquid loading on the tray being checked for size. This will
include allthe liquid entering the tray. For example on a side stream draw-off trayTHE ATMOSPHERIC AND V ACUUM CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS 141
under a pumparound section it will include;
rThe side stream feed to the stripper
rThe pumparound liquid
rThe liquid overﬂow from the tray
This loading should be in cubic feet per second (CFS).
Step 4. In the case of a new design, set the downcomer area in accordance with
Table A.1.3. For an existing trays use fabricator’ s drawings. Calculate the linear
velocity of the liquid in ft/sec. For good design this velocity should not exceed0.6 ft/sec at the downcomer outlet. Tray spacing should be such that the liquid levelin the downcomer should not exceed 50% of the tray spacing. To meet this criteriatray spaces on these critical liquid loading trays may be higher than the remainingtray spacing in the tower.
Step 5 . Summarize the vapor trafﬁc to the critical tray under examination. This should
be in lbs/hr and moles/hr. The vapor should be the total vapor as used to calculatethe tray overﬂow.
Step 6. Calculate the ﬂood vapor velocity Gf in lbs/hr sqft. For good tray design
(or performance of an existing tray) the actual vapor velocity should not exceed90% of this ﬂood value. This vapor ﬂood velocity is calculated using the followingexpression:
G
f=Kf√ρv×(ρl−ρv)
where
Gf=Mass velocity in lbs/hr sqft of bubble area at ﬂood.
ρv=Density of vapor at the tray conditions in lbs/cuft.
ρl=Density of liquid at the tray conditions in lbs/cuft.
Kf=constant based on tray spacing and given in Figure 3.13.
Step 7. Using the actual vapor load per sqft of bubble area as 90% of Gf, calculate
the bubble area as Gadivided into the total vapor ﬂow.
Step 8. Establish the following criteria using the characteristics given in Table A.1.3.
Where:
As=Total tray area in sqft.
Adc=Inlet and outlet down comer areas in sqft.
Aw=Waste area (about 20% of Ab).
Ab=Bubble area.
As=Ab+Aw+Adc
Use Figure 1.A.4 (relationship of chord height, area, and length) in the appendix asapplicable.142 CHAPTER 3
Calculate the overall tower height
Using the calculated vapor and liquid calculations check and ﬁx the number of trays"
"used to meet the tower’ s fractionation requirements. Then check the tray spacing. Fornormal fractionation a 24 inch tray spacing is acceptable. For draw-off trays withpumparound the section should be checked for high downcomer ﬁlling (that is inexcess of 50%). Trays in this section often require bigger tray spacing, usually 30inch. Calculate the tower height allocated to the trays. Allow 6 ft between top tray andthe top tangent line of the vessel to allow space for the reﬂux distributor and goodliquid/vapor separation.
The space required for the ﬂash zone (between the bottom fractionating tray and the
top residue stripper tray) is usually 10–14 ft depending on throughput and the swirlsize. The hot well below the bottom residue stripping tray should be sized to allowfor the steam inlet distributor and a surge hold up of the residue product. This surgehold up is based on the company’ s operating policy, but as a guide:
rIf the product is routed to storage 5 min hold up.
rIf the product is to be fed into a ﬁred heater of a downstream unit allow 15 min holdup.
The stripper columnThis column is sized using the same procedure as used for the main column sizing.As mentioned earlier the strippers for the various side streams are usually stackedone above the other to form a single uniform diameter tower. The only diameter thatmay change is that for the hold up section in the bottom product stripper. This maybe increased to adjust the height of the column to ensure the free ﬂow of un strippedfeed to each stripper from its respective draw-off tray in the main tower.
The number of trays for steam stripping is usually four. The tray spacing is also
usually 24 inches. For the height of the tower begin with setting the height of thebottom stripper’ s bottom tangent line above grade. This should be at least 15 ft toallow a reasonable available NPSH for the product pump. From there allow a 5–15min surge capacity at the calculated tower diameter and some 12 inches for the steaminlet distributor below its bottom stripping tray. Note the same comments apply tosurge capacities in this tower as given for the residue stripper product.
The crude feed preheat exchanger system design
All crude distillation units pre heat the incoming crude oil feed by heat exchange
with hot product and reﬂux streams. The preheated crude is then partially vaporisedto satisfy the ﬂash zone conditions by a ﬁred heater. The degree of preheat is a questionof an economic balance between the cost of the hardware and the savings in utilitiesTHE ATMOSPHERIC AND V ACUUM CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS 143
due to the recovery of heat from the hot product and reﬂux streams. The exercise to
arrive at this economic balance is one of critical analysis of the respective enthalpyand its temperature levels of the various streams to be considered for heat exchange.It requires also good cost data for the heat equipment included in the system. Thisequipment must include the cost of the heat exchangers (usually shell and tube), costof the ﬁnal product coolers, and the cost of the ﬁnal crude feed ﬁred heater.
More than one scheme is developed and their capital costs calculated from up to date
equipment vandor data if possible. Next the utility requirements and cost for eachsystem is developed using the company’ s unit utility costs. For an examination andcomparison of these systems these cost data must be on the same bassis for eachof the schemes. The following procedure is one of several that can be used for thiseconomic analysis:
Step 1. Construct the enthalpy curve for the crude feed. This stream will remain in the
liquid phase through the preheat train. The enthalpy curve therefore needs only to
consider sensible heat. Start at say 60
◦F , calculate the enthalpy by multiplying the
Btu/lb (from the enthalpy curve) by the total weight in lbs/hr, this gives the enthalpypoint on the curve in Btu’ s/hr. Proceed with a further 10–15 other temperature pointsto make a smooth temperature V’ s enthalpy curve.
Step 2. Examine the temperature and weight/hr of the overhead, pumparound, and
product streams. Select those that will be candidates for heat exchange againstthe crude feed. For example, the overhead stream from the main tower is a primecandidate for heat transfer against the cold crude because of its high heat content(latent heat) over a wide range of temperature. The kerosene product stream onthe other hand is usually a poor candidate. It contains only sensible heat overa short temperature range and is also probably the smallest product stream byweight.
Step 3. Prepare enthalpy curves for the selected candidates. In the case of pump-
arounds and the side stream products only the enthalpy (in Btu/hr) against say threeor four temperatures need to be plotted.
Step 4. The overhead vapor enthalpy curve requires a more complex calculation."
"Here the enthalpy curve must be based on its condensation curve. This requires acalculation of the streams equilibrium (vapor and liquid) composition at the con-densing range of temperatures and pressures. For this purpose assume a straightline pressure drop and temperature proﬁles between tower top and reﬂux drum.Select four to ﬁve pressures and their corresponding temperatures. For the purposeof this calculation it is assumed that no steam condenses in this segment of thesystem, therefore the equilibrium constants are taken at the partial pressure withsteam. Using the overhead vapor composition (in moles/hr) from the sum of over-head product plus reﬂux vapor calculate its vapor/liquid composition at the selectedtemperatures and pressure. Apply the enthalpy value to both phases (not forgettingthe steam) for the selected temperatures. Plot enthalpy in Btu/hr versus the selectedtemperature.144 CHAPTER 3
Step 5. Superimpose these product, overhead, pumparound enthalpy curves on the
crude feed enthalpy curve. Start with the overhead curve and then with each other
stream in their process sequence. Draw these enthalpy curves to provide a reason-able temperature approach to the crude feed curve. Figure 3.14 is an example ofthis concept.
Reasonable temperature approaches should not be less than 20
◦F for distillates and
between 40 and 60◦F for residues and heavy distillates.
Step 6. Several different schemes can now be developed using a ruler and set square
for each of the product stream in different sequences. In the case of the exchangeof heat against large volume streams such as the residue and perhaps the lowerpumparound these streams can be split. They can also be shown to ﬂow in seriesagainst the crude or in parallel.
Step 7. Size the heat exchanger equipment required for each of the schemes devel-
oped. This includes the sizing for additional equipment for each stream to meet itsrequired end temperature. For example the ﬁnal air coolers to meet product run-down temperature or trim coolers to meet pumparound return temperature. Sizingthese items need not be precise as long as they are on the same basis. The simpleequation for heat transfer
Q=UA/Delta1t
m
will sufﬁce for this purpose. The value of U may be taken from Figure 3.12.
Step 8. Note the end temperature of the crude and using this enthalpy and the total
enthalpy in the crude at the ﬂash zone of the main tower determine the duty requiredby the ﬁred heater in each case.
Step 9. Cost out the equipment required for each scheme. This includes all the heat
exchangers (including trim and ﬁnal coolers), and the ﬁred heater. These can usuallybe obtained from equipment vendors on a unit size ($ per sqft for example) basis.Estimate the utility requirements for the equipment in each scheme.
Step 10. Tabulate the results starting with the highest capital cost scheme as a base
case and calculate a simple incremental return on investment based on savings forthe remaining schemes. The scheme with the highest positive ROI should be thesystem selected.
In almost all modern crude distillation units there are facilities to remove free salt.These desalting facilities are proprietary units which consist of fresh water injec-tion into the crude feed and subsequent separation of the water, with the salt now insolution, from the oil. This separation takes place at a ﬁxed temperature at the appro-priate point in the crude feed preheat train. Demulsifying chemicals or (more usually)electrostatic precipitators or both are used to enhance this separation process. Thetemperature for this desalting process (usually around 220–250
◦F) must be catered
for in the crude feed preheating.700

Developing the material balance
The crude TBP and sg curves are given in Figures 3.15 and 3.16, respectively. The
TBP curve is divided into the distillate product cuts and also into narrow boiling pointcomponents.
The ASTM curves for the cuts are developed from the product cut points and prob-
ability paper. These are converted to TBP using the ‘Edmister’ method as shown inTable 3.1.
These values are plotted on Figure 3.17 and the narrow range components indicated
for each of the product cuts. Note the front end of the naphtha is the front end of thewhole crude so only the last segment of the cut is required in this calculation.
The cut characteristics are shown in Table 3.2.Overﬂash Cut range 690–725 (3 %vol on crude)

Total ﬂash zone pressure is 12 psig +10 psi =22 psig. Call it 25 psig (40 psia) for
design purposes.
Calculate the partial pressure of the hydrocarbon vapor at the ﬂash zone
Take the quantity of stripping steam as 1.2 lbs/gal of residue (from Figure 3.10).
The lbs/hr of stripping steam is 1.2 ×24,150 =28,980 lbs/hr.
=1,610 moles/hr
The partial pressure of the hydrocarbon vapor therefore is:

Total moles vapor×Total pressure =1,364.4

Table 3.4 deﬁnes the ﬂash curve at atmospheric pressure.
The ﬂash curve calculated above is that at atmospheric pressure. To plot this at any
other pressure take the 50 %vol temperature, and using the vapor pressure curvesfor hydrocarbons (see Figure 1.A.1 in the appendix) read off the temperature at thedesired pressure. Draw the EFV curve through this new temperature parallel to theatmospheric curve. The ﬂash zone temperature is the temperature at the % distilledon the partial pressure curve.
Flash zone temperature =720

The EFV curve is shown in Figure 3.18.
Calculate total heat in the crude at the ﬂash zone conditions
See Table 3.5 for the calculation of total heat in the crude at the ﬂash zone conditions.
Please note: The enthalpy data used here are taken from the author’ s private ﬁles. It
is recommended that the data given in Maxwell’ s Hydrocarbon Data orThe GPSA
Engineering Data Book be used for these heat balance calculations.
The tower heat balances
To calculate the temperature of the residue product leaving the tower
Consider the heat balance over the residue stripper as shown by the envelope in Fig-ure 3.1.11. The product residue is 197,085 lbs/hr (from the material balance). Thestrip out vapor from the top stripping tray is 6% (from Figure 3.10) =1,449 gals/hr.
Assume the SG of the strip out is 7.5 lbs/gal (about the same as the overﬂash) and themol wt is 305. Then the heat balance can be written as follows (see also Table 3.6):

To calculate the side stream draw-off temperatures
The steam rates to be used for side stream stripping will be:
All strippers will have three theoretical trays.
Both gas oil streams will use 0.5 lbs/gal respectively.The Kero stripper will use 0.65 lbs/gal of steam.
Steam used is as follows:
Heavy gas oil =3,675 ×0.5=1,838 lbs/hr
Light gas oil =6,300 ×0.5=3,150 lbs/hr
Kero =5,250 ×0.65=3,413 lbs/hr
rTower pressure proﬁle.
There will be 40 fractionating trays in the main tower (trays above the ﬂash zone)and four residue stripping trays (trays below the ﬂash zone). These trays will benumbered from the bottom to the top. Thus, the bottom residue stripping tray willbe tray 1. The tower top tray will be tray 45. The pressure proﬁle is shown in Fig-ure 3.1.19.

rEstablish draw-off tray location
Allow six wash trays above the ﬂash zone to the HGO draw off. The HGO andbottom pumparound will be drawn from tray 10.Allow two trays for the pumparound return. Thus the pumparound will return on totray 12.Allow 10 trays from tray 12 to the LGO and the top pumparound draw off. Thedraw-off tray will then be tray 22.Again allow two trays for the pumparound return. This will be tray 24.Allow 10 trays between top pumparound return and the Kero draw off. This locatesthe Kero draw-off at tray 34. It leaves 12 trays between the Kero draw off and thetop tray (includes the draw-off tray and the top tray).

rCalculate theoretical initial boiling points
The FRL for each cut is developed from the TBP cut. Thus:
HGO 50% TBP is 648◦F . Slope of TBP is 0.6◦F/%vol.
Slope of FRL is 0.2◦F/%./Delta1t50 (DRL – FRL) is 7◦F.
50% FRL is 641◦F . From FRL curve IBP is 626◦F.
LGO This is developed in the same manner as HGO and
the IBP of the FRL in this case is 527◦F.
Kero In the same way the Kero FRL has an IBP of 395◦F.
Now all these temperatures are at atmospheric pressure. It is now required to relate
these temperatures to the partial pressure of the respective trays.
rTo calculate the approximate partial pressures and draw-off temperatures
Assumptions:
1.0 All vapor lighter than the product cut is considered inert.2.0 Internal reﬂux is assumed as follows:
To HGO tray 290 mol/hr.
To LGO tray 250 mol/hrTo Kero tray 200 mol/hr158 CHAPTER 3
HGO tray partial pressure =Moles of HGO
Total moles HC vapor +Steam×Total pressure

3,224.9×38.1=19.6 psia
From vapor pressure curves theoretical draw-off temperature is 720◦F.
From Figure 3.9:
Theoretical temperature −Actual temperature =93◦F
Actual draw-off temperature is 720 −93=627◦F
Draw-off temperatures for the LGO and Kero are calculated in the same way and are:
LGO=493◦F
Kero=364◦F.
To calculate the tower top temperature
Set the reﬂux drum temperature and pressure. In this case these will be set at 10 psigand 100
◦F . Taking the pressure drop across the exchangers and piping the tower top
pressure will be 15 psig.
Fix the cold external reﬂux at 0.8 times the total moles overhead product;The total moles HC in the overhead vapor is 1.8 ×805.1 =1,449.18 moles/hr
Total moles steam in the overhead vapor is 2,076Partial pressure of the hydrocarbons in the overhead vapor is:
1,449.19 ×29.7
3,525.18=12.2 psia
The tower overhead temperature is the dew point of the hydrocarbons at the partial
pressure and is shown in Table 3.7.
K2=K1×Sx=0.135×0.984 =0.133 =246◦F which will be the tower top tem-
perature.

3.2 The vacuum crude distillation unit
As an introduction to this part of the chapter, it will be of interest to outline brieﬂy an
important development that occurred in this process during the early 1960s. Originallyvacuum units followed closely on design to the atmospheric unit except of course itoperated under a vacuum condition. The vacuum was obtained by a two or three stagesteam ejectors and the internals of the tower were traditional trays, mostly bubblecap type. Under these conditions the vacuum obtained in the ﬂash zone requiredthe injection of steam to provide the required hydrocarbon partial pressure for adequatevaporization of the fuel oil feed. With the molecular weight of steam low at 18 thetower vapor trafﬁc was extremely high in velocity requiring a large tower diameter toaccommodate it.
The break-through to provide vacuum towers of much lower diameters came in the ’60s
with the use of high capacity steam injectors producing very low vacuum condition inthe tower overhead. This coupled with the development of highly efﬁcient expandedgrid internals with very low pressure drop allowed the desired ﬂash zone conditionsto be met with out the injection of steam. This process became known as the ‘DryVac’ process and is the accepted process now for vacuum crude distillation. Such aprocess is describes below.
Process description
This process is often integrated with the Atmospheric Crude Distillation unit as far as
heat transfer is concerned. Generally the atmospheric residue from the CDU is routedhot to the ﬁred heater of the vacuum unit (Figure 3.25).
The atmospheric residue is further distilled to provide the heavy distillate streams used
for producing lube oil or as feed to conversion units. This distillation however has to170 CHAPTER 3
Figure 3.25. Vacuum distillation unit process schematic.
be conducted under sub atmospheric pressure conditions. The temperature required
for vaporising the residue at atmospheric pressure would be too high and the crudewould crack."
"The process follows very much the same pattern as the atmospheric distillation. Should
the cold feed be pumped from storage, it is heat exchanged against hot product andpumparound streams before being vaporised in the distillation unit heater. Normallythough the feed is pumped hot directly from the CDU’ s residue stripper to the vacuumunit’ s heater. Thereafter the distillate vapours are condensed in the tower by heat andmass transfer with the cold reﬂux streams moving down the tower in the same way asthe side streams in the Atmospheric unit. The products are taken off at the appropriatesections are cooled either by heat exchange with colder streams in the atmosphericunit, by air coolers or, in some cases as heating mediums to light end reboilers. Theyare then pumped to storage.
Neither the vacuum residue that leaves the bottom of the tower in this process nor the
side-streams are steam stripped. The vacuum condition is produced by steam ejectorstaking suction from the top of the tower. These ejectors remove inert and other vapourthat may exist and pull a vacuum of about 5 mmHG absolute. The tower internals areusually expanded grid type which offer low pressure drop such that the ﬂash zonepressure is about 25–30 mmHg absolute.THE ATMOSPHERIC AND V ACUUM CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS 171
The vacuum crude distillation unit’s ﬂash zone
At atmospheric condition of pressure the ﬂash temperature of normal atmospheric
residue feed to achieve any meaningful degree of vaporisation would be extremelyhigh (say in excess of 900
◦F). At these kind of temperatures the heavy residue will
begin to break up or crack. This forms coke in the extreme and oleﬁnic productswhich may not be desirable to the reﬁner. Effective vaporisation and fractionation canbe achieved however at reduced pressures. Under this condition a reasonable ﬂashtemperature (say 650–750
◦F) can be easily obtained.
As described earlier vacuum distillation units handling reduced crude operate at 3–5mmHg at the top of the tower and about 25–30 mmHg in the ﬂash zone. No steam isused for stripping. The oil can still crack of course if the cut point desired is so highthat excessively high ﬂash temperature is required to meet it even at reduced pressures.The following graph is a guide to the critical cracking temperatures (Figure 3.26).
This graph shows a plot of a range of temperatures within which the oil will begin to
crack. This is correlated to the Watson characteristic factor ‘K’. Most residuum witha 700
◦F cut point for Middle East crudes have a ‘K’ factor of about 11.5. From the
Figure 3.26. Critical cracking zone.172 CHAPTER 3
curve therefore it can be seen that these residuum would begin to crack at temperature
between 830◦F and 855◦F . The degree of cracking at or above the ‘Zone of critical
decomposition’ will be a function of temperature and the residence time of the oil atthat temperature.
Signiﬁcant cracking of the oil in a vacuum tower causes:
rHigh load to the ejectors (due to the formation of light ends)
rIn lube oil production, de-colorising of the distillate streams
rIn producing feed to hydro-treaters or hydro-crackers—high hydrogen consumption
in these units due to the presence of unsaturates as the product of cracking
It is therefore very desirable to avoid these critical temperature in a vacuum unit.
The tower overhead ejector system
Most ‘Dry Vac’ Towers have a similar overhead ejector system, and as the design of
this is critical to the units operation a calculation method to determine this design isdescribed below as calculation steps:
The calculation procedure that is described here relates to the ‘Dry’ vacuum unit
where no steam is used in the distillation process itself. This method can be usedto determine the efﬁciency of the installed ejector set under test run conditions orindeed to specify the equipment to be purchased. The efﬁciency of the ejectors maybe determined by the actual quantities of steam used to that calculated by this method.
The following data needs to be obtained to use this procedure:
rQuantity of inerts—either measured at the exhaust side of the last stage or estab-
lished as a design criteria
rTower top temperature and pressure required or observed
rIntermediate stage outlet temperatures and pressures of the process streams
rTotal steam ﬂow or steam ﬂow to each stage ejector
A diagram of a typical ejector set is as shown in Fig. 3.27.
The calculation proceeds with the following:
Step 1. Determine the quantity of inerts entering the system from the tower. If this
cannot be measured a rule of thumb is that total inerts is 0.5% to 1.0% by weight
on feed. This is made up of air leaking into the system and some light ends. Againby rule of thumb light ends will be about 25% of total inerts.THE ATMOSPHERIC AND V ACUUM CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS 173

Step 2. Calculate the ‘Equivalent Dry Air Load’ to the ﬁrst ejector stage. Using the
equation:
Wa=Wi
Rmi×Rti+Ws
Rms×Rts
where"
"Wa=Equivalent air ﬂow in lbs/hr.
Wi=Actual lbs/hr of o/head (includes air, and light ends).

In this case Wswill be zero, as no steam will be used in the distillation.

Step 4. Calculate the partial pressure of steam at the condenser pressure. This pressure
is the 1st/2nd stage intermediate pressure and is the suction pressure to the 2nd
ejector. It is read on the plant or it may be assumed. In the calculation its assumedto be 50 mmHg.
Step 5. From the partial pressure of steam the condensing temperature in the con-
denser is read from steam tables. Assume 90% steam is condensed in this ﬁrstcondenser.
Step 6. (Optional) Calculate heat balance across the condenser and arrive at the
condenser duty.
Step 7. Repeat step 2 for ‘equivalent dry air load’ to stage 2. Note there will now be
steam present in this calculation.
Step 8. Repeat steps 3–5 for the second stage, making an assumption for the condenser
pressure or reading off the actual pressure if the unit is an installed one. Assumealso the amount of steam condensed in the second condenser—this will be higharound 98%.
Step 9. Repeat steps 6 and 7 for the third stage condenser and ejector. This condenser
will be about 1 or 2 psi above atmospheric pressure.
Step 10. Summarize the above results into a process speciﬁcation for a required
ejector set or if already installed compare the performance (e.g. calculated steamconsumed versus actual).
Calculating ﬂash zone conditions in a vacuum unit
Flash zone conditions are easier to calculate for a ‘Dry’ vacuum unit than for the
atmospheric crude unit. Indeed the ﬂash zone conditions can be measured in vacuumunits with a greater degree of accuracy than in the case of the atmospheric column.
The procedure for predicting ﬂash zone conditions in this case follows a similar route
to that in the atmospheric unit case. The following steps describe this procedure.
Step 1. Develop the EFV from the TBP curve of the reduced crude. The same method
that was used in item discussing the ﬂash zone of the Atmospheric Crude Unit
in this chapter will apply in this case also. Remember the EFV calculated is foratmospheric pressure.
Step 2. Develop the material balance for the vacuum unit. As the ﬂash zone condi-
tions are to be used in most calculations involving the vacuum tower it is best todevelop the materials balance at this stage. To do this determine the distillate cutsrequired and by using the respective crude assay determine the speciﬁc gravityfor each cut using mid boiling points. The mid boiling point for each distillateproduct only should be determined in this case. Use the method described in Chap-ter 1 of this Handbook to determine mol weight. Some of these will need to beextrapolated.THE ATMOSPHERIC AND V ACUUM CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS 177
Step 3. Set the overﬂash. Now in this area of the TBP and EFV curves the slope of the
curve is quite steep. That is there is a high temperature difference for each percent
of volume increase. In vacuum units therefore a 1–2% over ﬂash would be realisticto meet a realistic coil outlet temperature.
Step 4. Determine the new ﬂash temperature to include the over ﬂash from the EFV
curve. This is the temperature at atmospheric pressure.
Step 5. Calculate the total pressure of the ﬂash zone. Vacuum towers operate at or
below 5 mmHg at the top. Pressure drop through the tower should not be more than25 mmHg. A well designed off take trays and packing should be as follows:
Grid packing 6–7 mmHg per 10 foot of packed height.
Draw off (chimney trays) 2–3 mmHg/tray.
Step 6. There will be no partial pressure calculation of hydrocarbon vapor (as in
the case of the atmospheric unit) as there is no steam in the ﬂash zone of a ‘Dry’vacuum tower. The total pressure calculated in Step 5 is the actual hydrocarbon ﬂashpressure. Using the vapor pressure curves determine the ﬂash zone temperature atthe total ﬂash zone pressure. This is the ﬂash zone temperature that will now beused for all heat balances, etc.
Draw-off temperatures
Unlike the atmospheric crude distillation unit the temperature of the vacuum tower
bottom (Bitumen) will be essentially the ﬂash zone temperature. There will be asmall difference, say 2–3"
"◦F , below actual ﬂash zone temperature due to over ﬂash
returning from the wash trays. Very often the overﬂash amount is drawn off frombelow the wash section and either sent to fuel or blended into the bitumen streamexternal to the tower. In this case the unquenched bitumen leaving the tower will beat ﬂash zone temperature. Again there is no steam present to inﬂuence this tempe-rature.
Side stream draw-off temperatures are easier to calculate for a vacuum tower than was
the case for the atmospheric tower. This is so because in a ‘dry vacuum’ column there isno steam to inﬂuence partial pressures and of course there is no side stream stripping.
A method similar to the ‘Packie’ method used for the atmospheric column is used for
the vacuum column draw off. In this case however it is only necessary to determinethe initial boiling point of the side stream EFV curve at the tower condition to arriveat the draw-off temperature.
Note: It is the IBP of the actual EFV curve in this case NOT the IBP of the ﬂash
reference line as in the case of the atmospheric unit. Also there will be no ‘Packie’
correction factors required in this case.178 CHAPTER 3
The calculation steps for this procedure are as follows:
Step 1. Draw the EFV curve from the sides tream TBP curve using the method
described earlier in this chapter. Only the 0, 10, 30, and 50% vol section of the
curve need to be developed.
Step 2. Set the total pressure at the draw-off tray. If this is not available as plant data
then use the criteria for pressure drop given in the item dealing with the ﬂash zone.
Step 3. Calculate the partial pressure of the side stream product at the draw-off tray.
To do this consider all material lighter than the draw off side stream to be inert.Include in the inert estimates of air leakage and cracked hydrocarbon vapors asdescribed earlier in this chapter in the item dealing with Tower Overhead Ejector
System. The total hydrocarbon vapor will include the overﬂow from the draw-offtray. As a rule of thumb estimate overﬂow as:
Top side stream 0.8 times product
Mid side stream 1.0 times productBottom side stream 1.5 to 2.0 times product
Step 4. Using the vapor pressure curves relate the IBP temperature of the EFV to the
partial pressure determined in Step 3. This is the draw-off temperature, and thiswill be the temperature for the respective side streams and pumparound draw offthat will be used in the tower heat balances.
Determine pumparound and internal ﬂows for vacuum towers
Now that the cut points and tower conditions of temperature and pressure are estab-
lished the internal ﬂow and pumparound duties can be calculated, although generallyspeaking fractionation requirements are not as strict in a vacuum crude unit as inthe case for the atmospheric unit. Nevertheless proper wash streams are required invacuum towers to protect distillates which nay become feed to cracking units, fromentrained undesirable components such as metals. Test runs on vacuum units thereforeshould include the determination of reﬂux streams and, in turn, tower loading.
The following steps outline a calculation procedure to determine pumparound re-
quirements and overﬂow (reﬂux) in the wash section of the tower.
Step 1. Set the overﬂow requirement for the L VGO draw-off tray using the rule of
thumb given in the previous item. Alternatively if this can be measured on the plant
use that data.
Step 2. From plant data or such data as can be developed from items on ejector system
and draw-off temperatures, calculate the heat balance below the L VGO draw-offtray.
Step 3. In this heat balance the bottom pumparound duty will be the unknown. Equate
heat in equals heat out to determine the duty of the pumparound required to producethe set overﬂow.THE ATMOSPHERIC AND V ACUUM CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS 179
Step 4. This pumparound duty can be checked on the plant by multiplying the ﬂow
in the pumparound by the enthalpy difference over the exchangers.
Step 5. Carry out the overall heat balance over the tower. That is, calculate the
difference between the total heat in with the feed and the total out with all the
products. This difference gives the total heat to be removed by both pumparounds.Assuming there are two pumparounds (top and bottom). The duty of the bottompumparound has already been calculated. Then the top pumparound duty will bethe total heat to be removed minus the duty of the bottom pumparound.
Step 6. Usually the most critical ﬂow in a vacuum unit is the wash oil ﬂowing over the
bottom wash trays or packing. This is the area where most undesirable entrainmentcan occur and this is the most vulnerable area for coking. Lack of wash oil enhancescontamination of the bottom product and promotes coking in this area.
Step 7. Carry out a heat balance over the bottom wash section of the tower. The"
"unknown in this case is the overﬂow liquid from the heavy vacuum gas oil. Equatethe heat in with feed and overﬂow with the heat out with total product vapors,overﬂow vapor, and bitumen to solve for the unknown.
Note: The quantity of overﬂow in this case is independent of pumparound duties
above it. It is dependant only on the amount of over ﬂash.
Calculate tower loading in the packed section of vacuum towers
As discussed earlier, most modern ‘dry’ vacuum towers use low pressure drop grid or
stacked packing. This packing enhances heat exchange in the tower and of course per-mits the tower to operate at very low pressures. Nevertheless this packing can becomeoverloaded causing high pressure drop in the tower and poor all-around performance.
This item describes a general method of evaluating the grid performance in terms of its
pressure drop. Please note this is a quick general method of estimating tower packingdesign or performance. Proprietary grid and packing manufacturers have their owncorrelations which they use in their design work. A more detailed examination ofpacked tower loading is presented in the author’ s published work titled ‘Elements ofChemical Process Engineering’*. The following are the calculation steps used forthis quick general packed section evaluation.
Step 1. Determine the liquid and vapor ﬂows across the section to be evaluated. As
calculated in the previous section “determine pumparound and internal ﬂows for
vacuum towers.”
Step 2. If the unit is existing and this calculation is to determine tower performance
then use manufacturers drawings for tower details such as dimensions of the packedsection.
Step 3. Calculate the liquid and vapor loads in terms of actual cubic feet per second

Step 4. Using the liquid load as calculated in step 3, read off the value for ‘ K’ from
Figure 3.32.
Calculate the linear velocity of the vapor at ﬂood from the expression
K=Vf√ρv/(ρ l−ρv)
where:
Vf=Vapor velocity at ﬂood in ft/sec.
ρv=Density of vapor in lbs/cuft at section conditions of temperature and
pressure
ρl=Density of liquid in lbs/cuft at section conditions.
Step 5. Calculate the actual vapor velocity required by multiplying the calculated
velocity at ﬂood by percent of ﬂood permissible if this is to be a new design. Thedesign cross sectional area of the tower is then the calculated vapor load in cuft/secdivided by the actual vapor velocity. If the unit is existing divide the vapor loadingin cuft/sec by the cross sectional area of the tower to arrive at the actual vaporvelocity in ft/sec. The existing unit operation as a percent of ﬂood will be the actualvelocity divided by the calculated ﬂood velocity times 100.THE ATMOSPHERIC AND V ACUUM CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS 181

Step 6. Estimate the HETP (height equivalent to a theoretical tray) as being between
1.5 and 2.0 ft. Use the higher ﬁgure for vapor percent of ﬂood 50–95% or higher
and the lower value for vapor ﬂood below 50%.
Step 7. Calculate the height of the packed section required for heat transfer using
the quantity of heat to be transferred as being the pumparound duty in Btu/hr.Then treat the section above the pumparound draw off as a simple heat exchanger.Use the liquid ﬂow to this section and the pumparound ﬂow as calculated in theprevious section (as part of the tower liquid load). The inlet temperature to thesection can be taken as that for the pumparound liquid ﬂow into the tower andthe temperature out of the section as the pumparound draw-off temperature.
Step 8. Read off an overall heat transfer coefﬁcient Ho from Figure 3.33.
Calculate the LMTD over the section from the temperatures used in the previoussection on pumparound etc. Then calculate the total area of tower required for theheat transfer from the expression:

Step 9. Calculate the theoretical number of trays required by dividing the total area
calculated in step 8 by the design cross sectional area (step 5). Multiply these

a. Valve diameter – Valve diameter is fixed by the vendor
b. Percent Hole Area, AO/AB12 8 to 15 Open area should be set by the designer. In general,
the lower and open area, the higher the efficiency
and flexibility, and the lower the capacity (due toincreased pressure drop). At values of open area
toward the upper end of the range (say 15%), the
flexibility and efficiency are approaching sieve trayvalues. At the lower end of the range, capacity anddowncomer filling becomes limited
c. Valve Pitch/diam. ratio – Valve pitch is normally triangular. However, this
variable is usually fixed by the vendor
d. Valve distribution- - On trays with flow path length ≥5', and for liquid

e. Bubble Area, AB– Bubble area should be maximised
f. Plate efficiency – Valve tray efficiency w ill be about equal to sieve

The distillation of the ‘Light Ends’ from crude oil
D.S.J. Jones
The ‘light ends’ unit is the only process in a reﬁnery conﬁguration that is designed
to separate ‘almost’ pure components from the crude oil. Its particular growth hasresulted from the need of those components such as the butanes and propanes tosatisfy a market of portable cooking fuel and industrial fuels. That these productscan be suitably compressed and stored in small, easily handled containers at ambi-ent temperatures provided the market popularity for these products, suitably titledButane LPG and Propane LPG. The term LPG referring to Liqueﬁed PetroleumGas.
The introduction of the ‘No Lead’ in gasoline program during the late 1960s set the
scene for the need of Octane sources additional to the Aromatics provided by highseverity catalytic reforming. A source of such high-octane additives is found in someisomers of butane and pentane. This added to the need for light end processes whichin many cases included the separation of iso butanes from the butane stream and alsoiso pentanes from the light naphtha stream.
A process description of a ‘light ends’ unit
The ‘light ends’ of crude oil is considered as those fractions in the crude that have a
boiling point below cyclo-hexane. The ‘light ends’ distillation units however includethe separation of the light naphtha cut, which is predominately pentanes and cyclo-pentanes, from heavy naphtha which contains the hexanes and heavier hydrocarbonsnecessary for the catalytic reformer feed. The feed to the ‘light ends’ distillation pro-cess is usually the full range naphtha distillate from the atmospheric crude distillationunit overhead condensate drum. In many cases the distillates from stabilizing crackerand reformer products are added to the crude unit overhead distillate to be includedin the ‘light end’ unit feed.

Figure 4.1. A typical light end unit conﬁguration.
A typical process conﬁguration for this unit is given in the ﬂow diagram Figure 4.1.
In this conﬁguration the total feed to the unit is debutanized in the ﬁrst tower. The
butanes and lighter hydrocarbons are totally condensed and collected in the column’ soverhead drum. Part of this condensate is returned to the tower top tray as reﬂux.The remainder is routed to a de-propanizer column. The bottom product from thede-butanizer is the full range naphtha product. This enters a naphtha splitter columnwhere it is fractionated to give an overhead distillate of light naphtha and a bottomproduct of heavy naphtha.
The de-propanizer separates the debutanizer overhead distillate to give a propane
fraction as an overhead distillate stream and the butane fraction (butane LPG) as thebottom product. The overhead distillate is fractionated in a de-ethanizer column toproduce a rich propane stream (propane LPG) as the bottom product. The overheadsfrom this column is predominately hydrocarbons lighter than propane. This stream isonly partially condensed to provide reﬂux for the tower. The uncondensed vapor isnormally routed to the reﬁnery’ s fuel gas system.
The products from the ‘light ends’ unit are as follows:THE DISTILLATION OF THE ‘LIGHT ENDS’ FROM CRUDE OIL 191
Naphtha Splitter — Light Naphtha (overhead distillate)
Heavy Naphtha (bottom product–Reformer feed)
De-propanizer — Butane LPG (bottom product)
De-ethanizer — Propane LPG (bottom product)
Fuel Gas (overhead vapor).
Developing the material balance for light end units
In light end towers the material balance is developed as a molal balance. This type of
balance is determined by the degree of separation of the feed molal components thatenter the distillate fraction and those that leave with the bottom product.
Effective separation by fractionation in light end towers obey the same laws as those
in the crude distillation units, that is: The degree of separation is the product of thenumber of trays (or stages) and the reﬂux (or overﬂow) in the column.
In the crude unit this separation was measured by the difference between the ASTM
95% point of the lighter fraction and the 5% ASTM point of the heavier fraction. Thisis the ASTM gap or overlap.
In light end towers the degree of separation is a little more precise. This is determined"
"by the distribution of key components in the two fractions to be separated. Keycomponents may be real components (such as C4’ s or C5’ s) or pseudo componentsdeﬁned by their mid boiling points. Normally key components are adjacent com-ponents by boiling point in the feed composition. Any two key components may beselected—a light key and a heavy key. By deﬁnition the light key has the lowerboiling point. Both key components must, however, be present in the distillate andbottoms product of the column. If a side stream exists then these keys must also bepresent in the side stream product.
There are several correlation that describe the behavior of these key components in
their distribution and relationship to one another. By far the more common of thesecorrelation is the Fenske equation which relates the distribution of key componentsat minimum trays with inﬁnite reﬂux. The equation is relatively simple and does notrequire iterative calculation techniques to solve it. The Fenske Equation is:

D=fractions in the distillate product
W=fractions in the bottom product
KLTkey=the equilibrium constant of the light key at mean system condition of
temperature and pressure
KHYkey=the equilibrium constant of the heavy key again at mean system condi-tions
The ratio of the equilibrium constants is called the “relative volatilities” of the keys.Setting fractionation requirements for light end towers is usually done to meet aproduct speciﬁcation. More often than not this speciﬁcation is the vapor pressure of theheavier fraction on the tolerable amount of a heavy key allowed in the lighter fraction.
Sometimes, however, a speciﬁcation for the separation may not be given. Under this
circumstance some judgment must be made in determining the most reasonable sepa-ration that can be achieved with the equipment. This item of the manual addresses cal-culation techniques that satisfy either premise, and the procedure for these now follow.
Case 1: Setting separation requirements to meet a speciﬁcation
In this case it is required to determine the amount of butane’ s that can be retained by
a light naphtha cut to meet a RVP speciﬁcation. The steps are as follows:
Step 1. Calculate the properties of the C
5+naphtha from a component breakdown.
These properties should give weight and mole rates per hour.
Step 2. Carry out a bubble point calculation of the C 5+fraction and inserting butane’ s
as the unknown quantity x.
Step 3. The equilibrium constantly used ( K) in the calculation will be at the temper-
ature and pressure conditions of the RVP (i.e., normally at 100◦F which is the test
temperature).
Step 4. Either the equilibrium constants given in the charts in the appendix may be
used or the relationship vapor pressure divided by total systems pressure may be
used.
Step 5. By deﬁnition the total moles liquid given is equal to the total moles vapor
(calculated) in equilibrium at the bubble point. Thus equate and solve for xas the
quantity of butane’ s tolerable to meet RVP .
Case 2: Setting fractionation where no speciﬁcation is given
Step 1. Determine the composition of the feed in terms of real components, pseudo
components or both. Calculate this in moles/hr and mole fractions.THE DISTILLATION OF THE ‘LIGHT ENDS’ FROM CRUDE OIL 193
Step 2. Select the key components, decide the minimum distribution of one or other
key. For example in a debutanizer C 5’ s allowed into LPG must not be more than
2% of the total C 4’ s and lighter. This is to protect the Butane LPG “Weathering”
Test Speciﬁcation.
Step 3. Give values to the fraction of LT and HY keys in the distillate and bottoms.
Usexas the unknown where appropriate.
Step 4. The Fenske equation will be used to calculate the distribution of keys. Deter-
mine the value of NMby taking the actual number of trays and using an efﬁciency
70–75% to arrive at total theoretical trays. Divide this ﬁgure by 1.5 to arrive at the
minimum theoretical trays NM. Don’t forget to add 1 for the reboiler to use in the
equation.
Step 5. Estimate the mean tower conditions. This can be achieved by examining past
plant logs, etc. Determine Kvalues for the keys at this mean tower condition. Use
published data for real components and the ratio of vapor pressure divided by totalsystems pressure for pseudo components.
Step 6. Solve for xin the Fenske correlation. This will be the split of the key compo-
nents and the basis for the material balance.
Very often when setting up a design for a light end tower the actual number of traysare not known at the time when calculation number two is required. The followingrule of thumb may be applied as a guide:

An example for illustrating Case 1 above is given in Chapter 1 of this Handbook
where the amount of butane LPG allowed to meet Gasoline RVP is calculated. Anexample of Case 2 is given as follows:
The overhead distillate from an atmospheric crude distillation unit operating at 50,000

The key components for the de-butanizer will be nC4 and iC5 as Lt and Hy keys
respectively. In the Fenske equation let xbe the moles/hr of nC4 in the distillate.
To satisfy the weathering test for butane LPG the maximum amount of C5’ s allowedin the de-butanizer distillate is 2.0 mol% of the total C4’ s and lighter. A reasonableamount of actual trays in a de-butanizer is 30. Allowing an efﬁciency of 70% thenumber of theoretical trays will be 21. It is reasonable to predict that the minimum194 CHAPTER 4

From past data an average operating condition of temperature and pressure for a de-
butanizer are 210◦F and 110 psig. At these conditions the equilibrium constants for
both keys are read from curves given in the GPSA Engineering Data as:
nC4=1.48
iC5=0.94
Then the relative volatility φ=1.48/0.94 =1.57.

Then

Calculating the operating conditions in light end towers
Light end units follow two calculation procedures for setting the conditions of tem-
perature and pressure in the fractionating towers. The ﬁrst procedure relates to towersin which the overhead product and reﬂux are totally condensed. The second procedurerelates to those towers where the overhead product is not totally condensed.
Calculating the tower top pressure and temperature for totally
condensed distillate product
This procedure commences with setting a realistic reﬂux drum temperature. This"
"is ﬁxed by the cooling medium temperature, such as ambient air temperature (forair coolers) or cooling water. As total condensation is required then the pressureof the reﬂux drum must be the bubble point of the distillate product (and reﬂux)at the selected drum temperature. Once the drum pressure has been calculated thetower top pressure can be determined by taking into account estimated or manu-facturers speciﬁed pressure drops for equipment and piping between the drum andtower top. As a rough estimate condensers and/or heat exchangers in the systemhave between 3 and 5 psi pressure drop. Allow also about a 2 psi pressure drop forpiping.
The tower top temperature is calculated as the dew point of the distillate product at
the total overhead pressure. There are usually no steam or inert gases present in thelight end tower overheads, so total pressure may be used. The following example usesthe de-butanizer overhead from the material balance given in section “Developing theMaterial Balance for Light End Units” above.
The ambient air temperature for the site is 60
◦F , and the operating temperature for the
reﬂux drum will be set at 100◦F . The bubble pressure at this temperature is calculated
and given in Table 4.3.

Allowing 3 psi pressure drop over the overhead condenser and 2 psi for the associated
overhead piping the tower top pressure becomes 130 psia (115 psig). The temperatureof the tower top is the dew point of the distillate product at the top pressure. This isgiven in Table 4.4.
There is reasonable agreement that total y=total Xtherefore the dew point and
therefore the tower top temperature at 115 psig is 152
◦F.
Calculating the overhead conditions for partially condensed
distillate and product
There are two circumstances where the overhead stream from a light ends tower may
not be totally condensed. The most common of these is in the case of the de-ethanizer.Here, usually, only sufﬁcient overhead stream is condensed to provide the overheadreﬂux stream. The reason for this is that at a normal condensing temperature thepressure required at the reﬂux drum would be unacceptably high. It would be so highthat the tower bottom pressure required would be higher than the bottom product’ scritical pressure and thus fractionation would not be possible. In this case the towerpressure is set again by the reﬂux drum pressure. Unlike the case of total condensationthe reﬂux drum pressure for this partial condensation is found as the dew point at thecondensing temperature of the distillate product. In fact the reﬂux drum becomes atheoretical fractionation stage. In certain cases refrigeration is used to totally condensethe overhead stream at an acceptable pressure, but this selection would be as a resultof a study of the operation’ s economics.
In certain processes where a high tower pressure (and consequently high temperature)
may cause deterioration of one or more of the products from the tower, the towerpressure is reduced by condensing only a fraction of the overhead distillate product.For this purpose a vaporization curve for the distillate product is constructed at aselected reﬂux drum temperature. This curve is developed by calculating a series ofequilibrium compositions of the distillate product at the reﬂux drum temperature butover a pressure range. A reﬂux drum pressure can then be selected from the curvethat satisﬁes an acceptable tower pressure proﬁle. A ﬁnal equilibrium calculation is198 CHAPTER 4
then made at this pressure to provide the component and quantity composition of the
liquid and vapor streams leaving the reﬂux drum.
Example of a de-ethanizer overhead operating conditions is given below:Consider the overhead vapor from the reﬂux drum, which is the product in this case,
has the following molar composition:
Mole Fraction
C
1 0.063
C2 0.443
C3 0.494
A reasonable temperature for operating the reﬂux drum is 100◦F (based on local
ambient conditions). The reﬂux drum pressure is calculated from as the dew point ofthe vapor at the reﬂux drum pressure, thus:
Vapor mole K@100◦F Liquid mole

C2 0.443 2.0 0.222
C3 0.494 0.64 0.772
Total 1.000 1.003
This was the second trial starting with the pressure at 450 psia. The total xvalue is
close enough to yto allow the pressure to be 350 psia."
"Now the Tower Top conditions will be at the dew point of the reﬂux plus the productleaving the tower. The pressure will be the reﬂux drum pressure plus say 7 psi for thecondenser and piping pressure drop. In this case this pressure will be 357 psia. Set thereﬂux ratio (moles reﬂux/moles product) to be 2.0:1 where the moles/hr of product is7.9. The composition of the reﬂux stream is the xvalue of the product vapor. The dew
point calculation to establish the tower top temperature therefore will be as follows(Table 4.5).
Note this dew point calculation may change if subsequent calculations show that the
reﬂux ratio required will be signiﬁcantly different to the one assumed here.
It is not proposed to show the case of the partially condensed product here. This
calculation would be similar to the de-ethanizer and in this case the reﬂux compositionwill be the liquid phase from the equilibrium ﬂash of the product.THE DISTILLATION OF THE ‘LIGHT ENDS’ FROM CRUDE OIL 199

Calculating the tower bottom conditions for light end towers
The calculation to establish the tower bottom conditions for all light end towers are the
same. Only the values for pressure and composition change. The temperature of theproduct leaving the bottom of the tower will be at its bubble point at the tower bottompressure. Consider the de-butanizer column whose material balance is given in Ta-ble 4.2.
The number of actual trays (estimated) to accomplish the separation between the C4’ s
and the C5’ s is 30. The pressure drop for fully loaded trays can be taken as beingbetween 0.15 and 0.2 psi. Assume then a press drop of 0.17 per tray. The tower toppressure calculated earlier is 125 psia, then the bottoms pressure is 125 +(0.17×
30)=130 psia (Table 4.6).
Calculating the number of trays in light end towers
For deﬁnitive design work one of the many excellent simulation packages should be
used. However most simulation packages require good quality input data. This often

means a fairly accurate estimate of the number of theoretical trays and the liquid/vapor
trafﬁc in the tower. An acceptably accurate ‘short cut’ method to arrive at the numberof theoretical trays is given here. The estimate of the liquid/vapor trafﬁc is discussedlater in this chapter.
The short-cut method for predicting number of theoretical trays
Three calculation or relationships are used to determine the number of theoretical
trays in this method. These are:
The Fenske calculation to determine the minimum number of trays at total reﬂux.
The Underwood calculation to determine the minimum reﬂux at inﬁnite number of
trays.
The Gilliland correlation which uses the result of the two calculations to give thetheoretical number of trays.
The Fenske equation
This has been discussed earlier under the section dealing with the “Material Balancefor Light End Towers.” The equation is as follows:
N
m+1=L o g[ ( L Tk e y/H Yk e y ) D×( H Yk e y/L Tk e y ) W]÷Log( KLTkey/KHY)
where
Nm=minimum number of theoretical strays at total reﬂux. The +1 is the reboilerwhich is counted as a theoretical tray
LT key =is the mole fraction of the selected light key
HY key =is the mole fraction of the selected heavy key
D=fractions in the distillate product
W=fractions in the bottom product
K
LTkey=the equilibrium constant of the light key at mean system conditionof temperature and pressure
K
HYkey=the equilibrium constant of the heavy key again at mean system conditions
The Underwood equation and calculation
The Underwood equation is more complex than the Fenske, and requires a trial anderror calculation to solve it. The equation itself is in two parts: The ﬁrst looks at the
vapor volatilities (ratio of the K’ s) of each component to one of the keys, then by trial
and error arriving at an expression for a factor Bthat forces the equation to zero. This
ﬁrst equation is written as follows:
/Sigma1((φi)·(xiF)÷(xiF)−B))=0THE DISTILLATION OF THE ‘LIGHT ENDS’ FROM CRUDE OIL 201
where
φi=The relative volatility of component i.
xiF=The mole fraction of component iin the feed.
B=The factor that forces the expression to zero.
The second part of the equation is expressed as follows:
R(m+1)=/Sigma1((φi)(xiD))÷((xiD)−B))
where"
"Rm=Minimum reﬂux at inﬁnite number of trays.
xiD=The mole fraction of iin the distillate.
The relationship between the Fenske equation and the Underwood is given by the

Condenser and reboiler duties
Both the condenser and reboiler duties are the result of the light ends tower heat
balance that meets the degree of separation required in the products. It may be saidthat the condenser duty and operation determines the amount of wash liquid ﬂow in thetower to meet the degree of rectiﬁcation required for the lighter product. The reboilerin turn generates the vapor ﬂow in the tower to satisfy the degree of stripping requiredfor the particular separation and the quality of the heavy product. At a constant feedtemperature and pressure, changes to either the condenser duty or the reboiler dutywill effect the duty of the other. In other words the tower must always be in heatbalance.
Calculating the condenser duty
The duty of the overhead condenser is determined by a heat balance over the tower
top (above the top tray) and reﬂux drum, with the condenser duty being the unknownquantity. Using the data already determined for the debutanizer in the previous sectionsof this the following is a calculation to determine the condenser duty for this unit.
Consider the following heat balance sketch (Figure 4.3).In the following heat balance the liquid overﬂow from the top tray is based on the
internal reﬂux ratio obtained from the Fenske, Underwood equations and the Gillilandcorrelation. This ratio is in moles and its molecular weight is derived from the molal

composition of the dew point calculation to establish the tower top temperature. It is
the mole weight of the liquid in equilibrium with the overhead distillate vapor. Thusthe total moles of the overﬂow liquid is 4.3 ×191.66 =824.14 moles/hr. Its mole
weight is 56.79. Therefore overﬂow liquid is 46,803 lbs/hr. The heat balance nowfollows (Table 4.7).
The top tray temperature is taken as 3 degrees above the tower top temperature. The
vapor to the top tray is taken as about 5 degrees above the top tray.
Condenser duty is 7,100,000 Btu/hr.
Calculating the reboiler duty
It is important that the reboiler duty achieve a balance between generating an effective
rate of vapor for stripping the bottom product while maintaining an economic vaporload on the stripping trays. As a rule of thumb this can be achieved with a strippingrate as a percent of bottom product of between 70 and 90 mole. The tower bottomstemperature has already been calculated as 358
◦F at 138 psia. The composition of the
vapor in equilibrium at these conditions has also been calculated. Thus the moles/hrof bottom product is 1,359.79 then the moles strippout required will be 1,359.79 ×
0.9=1,223.8 moles/hr. The molecular weight of strippout is 88 (from the equilibrium"
"composition). The heat balance to determine the reboiler duty now follows. In thiscalculation the draw off tray to the reboiler is about 10
◦F lower than the tower bottom
temperature that is 348◦F (Table 4.8).
Reboiler duty is 13,403,000 Btu/hr.
Calculating the overall tower heat balance
Knowing the reboiler and condenser duties an overall heat balance over the tower
can be calculated and will provide the pre-heat required in the feed and consequentlyTHE DISTILLATION OF THE ‘LIGHT ENDS’ FROM CRUDE OIL 205

(mean inlet pressure) was made. This temperature was 305◦F . Should the calculated
temperature be above this then an enthalpy curve would need to be developed for thefeed to determine its actual enthalpy and temperature. The overall heat balance nowfollows (Table 4.9).

proﬁle and a 75% efﬁciency for rectifying trays with a 65% efﬁciency for the stripping
trays (see Figure 4.4). Both the temperature proﬁle and the tray efﬁciencies will beﬁnalized by a suitable computer simulation package or a rigorous tray to tray calcu-lation. Note: The calculation techniques and examples given here are good input tocomputer simulation packages. Wherever possible these packages should be used forﬁnal process design.

Light end towers all follow the following principles of cross sectional area sizing and

between trays to ensure proper separation of clear liquid from the frothy mixture of
the tray inlet ﬂuid. There are many procedures and co-relations to determine thesedimensions. The following method is just one which will provide a good estimatefor tower design. For deﬁnitive design however it is essential that tray manufacturersbe consulted and their methodology be used. After all they, the manufacturers, willbe required to guarantee the performance of the unit in terms of ﬂooding capacityand tray efﬁciency. In all cases this has to be a signiﬁcant consideration but in caseof super fractionating units with over a hundred trays in many cases this has to be aprimary consideration.
There are many light end tower computer simulation packages in the market, and most
of these calculate vapor and liquid trafﬁc in the tower on a tray to tray basis. The inputfor these programs however does require a fairly accurate estimate of these values foreasy convergence and subsequent use of the program. The following procedure withthe equations used can provide details of tower loading and tray criteria at critical traysin the tower. A linear co-relation between these points will then provide a reasonableloading proﬁle over the tower sufﬁcient for good computer input.
Tower loading and overall tower diameter
The diameter of a fractionating tower is usually based on the vapor loading on two
critical trays. These are the tower top tray which will set the diameter for the rectifyingsection (i.e., the trays above the feed tray), and the tower bottom tray. This lower trayTHE DISTILLATION OF THE ‘LIGHT ENDS’ FROM CRUDE OIL 207
sets the tower diameter for the stripping section of the tower, (i.e., the feed tray and
the trays below the feed tray). These two sections may have different diameters.
The vapor loading is based on the rate of vapor passing through the tray and the
density of the vapor and the liquid on the tray through which the vapor bubbles. Thisrelationship is given by the Brown and Souder equation. There are several forms of
this equation which can be used with the appropriate physical tray constants. One ofthe forms used here is as follows:
G
f=K√(ρv×(ρl−ρv)).
where
Gf=Mass of vapor per sq foot of tray at ﬂood (lbs/hr ·sqft)
K=A constant based on tray spacing at ﬂood (see Chapter 3)
ρv=Density of vapor at tray conditions of temperature and pressure in lbs/cuft
ρl=Density of liquid at tray conditions in lbs/cuft"
"The area thus determined is the ‘Bubble’ area of the tray. Normally trays are designedat 85 to 90% of ﬂood. Therefore for good design the Gf is divided by this percentageto give the actual or design area of the tray. The whole tray is made up of two otherareas: That for the down comers, and a waste area which is allocated to calming theliquid leaving the bubble area before entering the down comer. The relationship ofthese areas to one another is given in Table 4.10.
Using the criteria in Table 4.10 and the value of the bubble area based on the vapor
loading the total tray area and therefore the tower diameter can be determined. Thisrelationship is summed up by the following expression:
A
s=AB+Adc+Aw
where
As=Total tray area
AB=Bubble area
Adc=Down comer area (inlet +outlet)
Aw=Waste or calming zone area (usually 15% of As)
Tray spacing
The tray spacing used in the initial determination of Flood Loading needs to be
checked. If necessary the spacing and the calculation will be revised to meet thecorrect spacing criteria. Usually this ﬁrst guess at tray spacing is taken as 24
/prime/prime. The
following equations are then applied to determine whether this spacing is satisfactory.These equations calculate the pressure drop across the tray in terms of the clear liquid208 CHAPTER 4

Checks for light end tower operation and performance
Most light end towers are very stable in their operation. That is, once they are lined
out for an operating requirement normal unit control maintain their stability. Whenperformance falls off it can be attributed to one of a few reasons. This item looks atsome of these reasons and how they can be evaluated and checked. By performancein this case is meant the ability of the unit to make product quality at the prescribedthroughput.
Cold feed
The condition of the feed entering the tower is very important to the tower operation.
Ideally the feed should enter the tower at as close to a calculated feed tray temperatureas possible. If the feed is well below its bubble point on entering the tower, severaltrays below the feed tray are taken up for heat transfer before effective mass transfercan begin. This could prevent the speciﬁed product separation occurring and trayTHE DISTILLATION OF THE ‘LIGHT ENDS’ FROM CRUDE OIL 215
efﬁciency in this section of the tower falls off dramatically. Feed condition can be
checked by bubble point calculation and a ﬂash calculation (Item 3.7).
Hot feedThis situation is probably the more serious regarding feed condition. If the feed enters
at a temperature far above its bubble point its resulting enthalpy will be such asto reduce the reboiler duty. This will occur automatically as the tower must alwaysbe in heat balance. The tower controls will maintain the product quantity and split.However, if the reboiler duty is drastically reduced insufﬁcient stripper vapors willbe available for the stripping function. Poor separation will result.
As a rule of thumb the stripping vapor to the bottom tray must be at least 70% mole
of the bottom product make. In super fractionation such as a de-isopentanizer thisﬁgure would be at least 80–100% of bottoms make.
Heat balances as shown in items and will quickly determine the stripping vapor status.Ideal feed conditionIdeally the feed should enter the tower close to feed tray temperature. Usually then
at the inlet pressure the feed will be in a mixed phase with the vapor portion veryclose in quantity to the distillate product. As the feed to these units are generallyheated by the bottoms product heat exchange, the approach temperatures are alwaysa consideration. To maintain good feed conditions however it is often beneﬁcial toinclude a separate steam (or hot oil) feed pre-heater.
EntrainmentA common cause of poor plant performance at high throughout or high reﬂux rates
is liquid entrainment or carry over from tray to tray. Very often in a high load andentrainment situation the problem is further agitated by increasing reﬂux to attemptseparation improvement.
A well designed light end tower can operate up to about 120% of allowable ﬂood
before substantial carry over occurs. Loading above this ﬁgure would result in somedegree of entrainment.
Downcomer backup and ﬂoodingIf tower loadings are increased well above allowable ﬂood point there is a real danger
that down comers become unable to cope with the liquid load. They would ﬁll and thetower would be in a state of ﬂood. This will be very apparent with very high abnormal216 CHAPTER 4
pressure drop occurring across the tower. Separation by fractionation is not possible
under these conditions. Heat input (and feed rate) to the tower must be reduced tobring the units back to a normal pressure drop.
Low tower loadingMost towers have been designed with at least a 50% turndown ratio for the trays. This
means that the trays should operate satisfactorily at 50% of their loading. Neverthelesstray performance does fall off at these low loadings. At below this turndown ratioperformance particularly in sieve trays is drastically reduced. This is almost certain tobe due to “weeping” where liquid falls from tray to tray. If the low loads are to be foronly a short time due to temporary reduced throughput tray loading can be increasedby increasing reﬂux. If the low throughput is to continue for an extended period oftime a tray blanking schedule should be considered to reduce the active tray area.
Operating close to critical conditionsDe-ethanizer in particular operate close to critical pressure in the bottom of the tower."
"Careful attention should be paid to avoid any pressure surges in this unit. Feed to theunit and reﬂux streams should be on ﬂow control.
No separation by fractionation can occur at pressures in excess of critical. Very often
chilled water is used for overhead condensing to reduce reﬂux drum pressure butmaintaining minimum C

Catalytic reforming
Peter R. Pujad´ o and Mark Moser*
Catalytic reforming is a process whereby light petroleum distillates (naphthas) are
contacted with a platinum-containing catalyst at elevated temperatures and hydrogenpressures ranging from 345 to 3,450 kPa (50–500 psig) for the purpose of raising theoctane number of the hydrocarbon feed stream. The low octane, parafﬁn-rich naphthafeed is converted to a high-octane liquid product that is rich in aromatic compounds.Hydrogen and other light hydrocarbons are also produced as reaction by-products. Inaddition to the use of reformate as a blending component of motor fuels, it is also aprimary source of aromatics used in the petrochemical industry (1).
The need to upgrade naphthas was recognized early in the 20th century. Thermal pro-
cesses were used ﬁrst but catalytic processes introduced in the 1940s offered betteryields and higher octanes. The ﬁrst catalysts were based on supported molybdenumoxide, but were soon replaced by platinum catalysts. The ﬁrst platinum-based reform-ing process, UOP’ s Platforming™ process, came on-stream in 1949. Since the ﬁrstPlatforming unit was commercialized, innovations and advances have been made con-tinuously, including parameter optimization, catalyst formulation, equipment design,and maximization of reformate and hydrogen yields. The need to increase yields andoctane led to lower pressure, higher severity operations. This also resulted in increasedcatalyst coking and faster deactivation rates.
The ﬁrst catalytic reforming units were designed as semiregenerative (SR), or ﬁxed-
bed units, using Pt/alumina catalysts. Semiregenerative reforming units are peri-odically shut down for catalyst regeneration. This involves burning off coke andreconditioning the catalyst’ s active metals. To minimize catalyst deactivation, theseunits were operated at high pressures in the range of 2,760 to 3,450 kPa (400–500 psig).High hydrogen pressure decreases coking and deactivation rates.
*c/circlecopyrtUOP LLC
217218 CHAPTER 5
Catalytic reforming processes were improved by introducing bimetallic catalysts.
These catalysts allowed lower pressure, higher severity operation: ∼1,380–2,070 kPa
(200–300 psig), at 95–98 octane with typical cycle lengths of one year.
Cyclic reforming was developed to allow operation at increased severity. Cyclic re-
forming still employs ﬁxed-bed reforming, but each reactor in a series of reactorscan be removed from the process ﬂow, regenerated, and put back into service withoutshutting down the unit and losing production. With cyclic reforming, reactor pressuresare approximately 200 psig, producing reformates with octanes near 100.
Another solution to the catalyst deactivation problem was the commercialization of the
Platforming process with continuous catalyst regeneration, or the CCR Platformingprocess, by UOP in 1971. The Institut Fran¸ cais du P´ etrole announced the commer-cialization of a similar continuous regeneration reforming process a few years later.With CCR small amounts of catalyst are continuously removed from the last reac-tor, regenerated in a controlled environment, and transferred back to the ﬁrst reactor.The CCR Platforming process has enabled the use of ultra low pressures at 345 kPa(50 psig) with product octane levels as high as 108. More than 95% of all new cat-alytic reformers are designed with continuous regeneration. In addition, many unitsthat were originally built as SR reforming units have been revamped to continuouslyregenerable reforming units.
Figure 5.1 illustrates the evolution of catalytic reforming, in terms of both process
yields and octane numbers.

Feedstocks
Naphtha feedstocks to reformers typically contain parafﬁns, naphthenes, and aromat-
ics with 6–12 carbon atoms. Most feed naphthas have to be hydrotreated to removemetals, oleﬁns, sulfur, and nitrogen, prior to being fed to a reforming unit. A typicalstraight run naphtha from crude distillation may have a boiling range of 150–400
◦F
(65–200◦C)."
"In addition to naphthas from crude distillation, naphthas can be derived from a varietyof other processes that crack heavier hydrocarbons to hydrocarbons in the naphtharange. Cracked feedstocks may be derived from catalytic cracking, hydrocracking,cokers, thermal cracking, as well as visbreaking, ﬂuid catalytic cracking, and syntheticnaphthas obtained, for example, from a Fischer–Tropsch process.
Light parafﬁnic naphthas are more difﬁcult to reform than heavier naphthenic hydro-
carbons. Distillation values for the initial boiling point, the mid-point at which 50%of the naphtha is distilled over, and the end point are often used to characterize anaphtha (Figure 5.2). If available, however, it is best to have a detailed componentbreakdown as provided by gas chromatographic analysis (Table 5.1).
Feed hydrotreating is used to reduce feedstock contaminants to acceptable levels
(Figure 5.3). Common poisons for reforming catalysts that are found in naphthaare sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen compounds (Figure 5.4). Removing these requiresbreaking of a carbon-sulfur, -nitrogen or -oxygen bond and formation of hydrogensulﬁde, ammonia, or water, respectively. Hydrotreaters will also remove oleﬁns andmetal contaminants.
Some hydrotreaters are two-stage units. The ﬁrst stage operates at low temperature
for the hydrogenation of dioleﬁns and acetylenes that could polymerize and plug thesecond, higher severity stage. The efﬂuent from the ﬁrst stage is cooled and fed to220 CHAPTER 5

the second stage for the hydrogenation of oleﬁns and the removal of sulfur and nitrogen
compounds.
The reformate stream from a catalytic reforming unit is invariably used either as a high-
octane gasoline blending component or as a source of aromatics—BTX (benzene,toluene, and xylenes), and C
9+aromatics. Reforming for motor fuel applications
still represents the majority of existing reforming capacity. Reformate speciﬁcations(octane, vapor pressure, end point, etc.) are set to provide an optimum blending prod-uct. The octane requirement is met through the production of high-octane aromatics,the isomerization of parafﬁns, and the removal of low octane components by crackingthem to gaseous products. Feedstocks to these units are typically “full range” naph-thas, consisting of hydrocarbons with 6–12 carbon atoms; however, the initial boilingpoint may be varied to limit the presence of benzene precursors.
Reforming units for the production of aromatics are often called BTX reformers.
Naphthas for these units are speciﬁed to contain mostly naphthenes and parafﬁns of6–8 carbons. The desired reaction is aromatization through dehydrogenation of thenaphthenes, and cyclization and dehydrogenation of the parafﬁns to the analogousaromatic.

Reformate properties
Table 5.2 shows a typical reformate composition. For motor fuel applications, the"
"octane number is the dominant parameter of product quality. A higher octane numberreﬂects a lower tendency of the hydrocarbon to undergo a rapid, inefﬁcient detonationin an internal combustion engine. This rapid detonation is heard as a knocking sound inthe engine, so octane is often referred to as the antiknock quality of a gasoline. Motorfuel octanes are measured at low engine speeds (research octane number or RON) orat high engine speeds (motor octane number or MON). In the United States, the octanevalues posted on gasoline pumps are the arithmetic average of the MON and the RON.The acronym RONC, research octane number clear, is used to denote that there are noadditives, such as lead, used to increase octane number. Table 5.3 provides a listingof the various octanes of pure hydrocarbons according to the American PetroleumInstitute, API (2).
Octane numbers of a hydrocarbon or hydrocarbon mixture are determined by com-
paring its antiknock qualities with various blends of n-heptane (zero octane) and2,2,4-trimethylpentane, or iso-octane (100 octane). Hydrocarbons may appear tohave different octane numbers when blended with other hydrocarbons of a differ-ent composition—these are denoted as “blending octanes” and may be signiﬁcantlydifferent from the actual octane numbers of the individual hydrocarbon components(Table 5.4) (3).
Other property speciﬁcations of the reformate include volatility or vapor pressure,
often given in terms of the Reid vapor pressure or RVP , end point, color, etc. (3) High-end point reformates, for example, may not combust well in an internal combustionengine.

Reformulated gasolines, a requirement of the 1990 Clean Air Act, are the subject
of much legislation. Speciﬁcations require a lower benzene content, lower volatility,and lower end point. Other speciﬁcations may pertain to the oxygenate content andother factors that affect the burning characteristics. The gasolines available to theconsumer consist of a mixture of gasoline fractions from many reﬁnery sources,including: straight run (unprocessed fraction), isomerate, alkylate, reformate, andFCC fractions, and, on occasion, polymer gasolines.
Reforming reactions
In BTX production, the objective is to transform parafﬁns and naphthenes into ben-
zene, toluene, and xylenes with minimal cracking to light gases. The yield of desiredproduct is the percentage of feed converted to these aromatics. In motor fuel ap-plications, octane values of the feed may be raised via aromatization or throughisomerization of the parafﬁns into higher octane branched species without sacriﬁcingyield. Yield is typically deﬁned as liquid product with ﬁve or more carbons.
Typical catalysts that consist of platinum supported on alumina (with or without other
metals or modiﬁers) are bifunctional in that separate and distinct reactions occur on theplatinum site and on the alumina. The platinum typically performs dehydrogenationand hydrogenolysis, while the acidic alumina isomerizes, cyclizes, and cracks.
The dehydrogenation of naphthenes to aromatics is probably the most important
reaction. Feeds contain cyclopentanes and substituted cyclopentanes, as well as cy-clohexanes and their homologues. Six carbon ring cyclohexanes, for example, can bedirectly dehydrogenated to produce aromatics and hydrogen.
+ 3H 2
Dehydrogenation is typically catalyzed by the platinum function on the reformingcatalyst.CATAL YTIC REFORMING 225
Five member ring cyclopentanes must be hydroisomerized to give a cyclohexane
intermediate prior to dehydrogenation to aromatics.
+     3H2
Acid-catalyzed reactions together with the Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation function arelargely responsible for hydro-isomerization reactions that lead to the formation ofaromatics.
Parafﬁn conversion is the most difﬁcult step in reforming. For that reason, the ability
to convert parafﬁns selectively is of paramount importance in reforming. Parafﬁnsmay be isomerized over the acidic function of the catalyst to provide higher octanebranched parafﬁns.

Another acid catalyzed parafﬁn reaction is cracking to lighter products, thus remov-ing them from the liquid product. Octane is improved through the removal of lowoctane parafﬁnic species from the liquid product by their conversion to gaseous,lower molecular weight parafﬁns.

After cyclization, cyclohexane undergoes dehydrogenation to aromatics. Cyclopen-
tanes undergo hydroisomerization to cyclohexane, followed by dehydrogenation toaromatics. Aromatics are stable species and relatively inert. Reactions of substi-tuted aromatics involve isomerization, hydrodealkylation, disproportionation, andtransalkylation.
Small amounts of oleﬁns are formed that also undergo a number of isomerization,
alkylation, and cracking reactions. In particular, they appear to play an important roleas an intermediate in cyclization reactions.
The dehydrogenation of naphthenes and parafﬁns is rapid and equilibrium concentra-
tions are established in the initial portions of a catalyst bed. Isomerization reactionsare sufﬁciently fast that actual concentrations are near equilibrium. The observed re-action rate for dehydrocyclization is reduced by the low concentrations of the oleﬁnintermediates that exist at equilibrium. Hydrogen partial pressure signiﬁcantly affectsoleﬁn equilibrium concentrations and has a signiﬁcant impact on aromatization anddehydrocyclization of parafﬁns. Lowering hydrogen partial pressures results in anincrease in the rate of aromatization, a decrease in the rate of hydrocracking, and anincrease in the rate of coke formation.

conditions. Current designs at low hydrogen partial pressures ensure full conversionto the equilibrium limits.
Catalysts
The platinum must be dispersed over the alumina surface such that the maximum
number of active sites for dehydrogenation is available. Platinum cluster size dimen-sions are on the order of angstroms, or 10
−10meters. The interaction of the platinum
with the alumina surface is such that the platinum clusters are relatively immobile anddo not agglomerate during reforming. Sulﬁdation of the platinum is sometimes usedto partially poison the platinum, or reduce its activity; this has the beneﬁcial effectof reducing a major portion of the hydrogenolysis, or metal-catalyzed cracking reac-tions. Liquid product yields are improved and the light gas production, particularlymethane, is reduced.
The alumina support is usually in the eta (η ) or gamma (γ ) phase, but most often
gamma is used in reforming. Chloride is added to promote acidity. A simpliﬁed
schematic diagram of the alumina functionality is given in Figure 5.5.
Catalysts that are used in reactors where the catalyst bed is not easily removed after
deactivation must have long catalyst life cycles. A typical ﬁxed bed catalyst life cyclemay be a year or longer. Modiﬁers are added to reduce the effect of coke buildup and tolengthen the catalyst cycle length, either by hydrogenating the coke to a less graphiticspecies (6) or by cracking the coke precursors (7). Elements that are commonly addedto the catalysts are rhenium and, to a lesser extent, iridium.
In moving bed units (8) the catalyst ﬂows through the reactors and is regenerated
continually in a sepaarte regeneration vessel that is part of the reactor–regeneratorloop. Process conditions are much more severe, thus shortening catalyst life andrequiring regeneration cycles of only a few days. In moving bed catalysts elementsare added, such as tin and germanium, to increase liquid, aromatic, and hydrogenyields by reducing the activity of the platinum for hydrogenolysis or metal-catalyzedcracking reactions. These components also provide some stabilization of the catalystrelative to Pt alone.

In a ﬁxed bed or SR unit, this coke will deactivate the catalyst such that, in time,the temperature limit of the reforming unit will be reached, or the selectivity to desiredproducts is too much reduced, or the octane of the liquid product is declining. Whenthis occurs, the reﬁner will shut down the process unit and regenerate the catalyst to re-turn it to its original state. In a moving bed unit, some of the catalyst is continually beingregenerated outside the process and returned to the reactors. High selectivity and ac-tivity are maintained. New, degradation-resistant catalysts allow the reﬁner to operatecontinuous regeneration units for more than eight years before removing the catalyst.The actual chemistry and steps for regeneration for all process units are very similar.In the following discussion, catalyst regeneration for a SR reformer is described. Forcyclic or continuous reformers, plant shutdown and start-up are unnecessary and theremaining steps are accomplished in equipment outside the process stream.
The objective of regeneration is to return the catalyst to its initial, fresh state. If
the regeneration is successful, there is no difference between fresh and regeneratedcatalyst. To do this, the coke must be burnt off the catalyst, the platinum should be welldispersed and in a reduced state, and the acidity should be properly adjusted throughchloride adsorption. These needs account for the steps in regeneration; carbon burn,chloride redispersion and metals reduction.
In order to conduct a regeneration, the heater temperatures and feed rates are reducedgradually. The circulation of recycle gas is continued to strip hydrocarbons from thecatalyst, leaving only coke. If the coke is to be burnt in the unit, higher temperaturesare maintained and the coke burning procedure is initiated. If the coked catalyst isto be removed from the unit, temperatures are lowered, to about 100–150
◦F before
unloading. Since coked catalyst is often pyrophoric, nitrogen blanketing is often usedto protect the catalyst from air contact and combustion.
The coke burning step must be carefully monitored. The combustion of coke to car-
bon dioxide and water is exothermic, and the oxygen concentration must be kept lowto limit the reaction and temperature rise. Excessive temperature can cause agglom-eration of the platinum or, in more extreme cases, can cause the alumina to changeCATAL YTIC REFORMING 229
from the desired phase or crystal structure to a higher temperature phase. The water
produced in the combustion also facilitates sintering of platinum. Due to the need togradually burn coke, the carbon burn is usually the most time-consuming part of aregeneration.
Coke burning is usually done in the range of 400–500
◦C, and at oxygen concentrations
initially in the 1–2 mol% range. Oxygen content and temperature are often increased
during burning to ensure that all coke has been combusted by the end of the burn.Oxygen consumption is monitored to determine the total amount of coke combustedand the extent of the burn.
Since platinum can agglomerate even at relatively moderate exothermic conditions,
the platinum must be redispersed after the carbon burn. The temperature is ﬁrstincreased to approximately 500
◦C, oxygen content to approximately 5–6 mol%, and
chlorine or an organic chloride that breaks down to HCl and Cl 2is injected into the
air/nitrogen stream. Platinum oxychlorides or chlorides form that redisperse platinumover the alumina surface, ensuring that almost all the platinum is exposed for reaction.This also adds chloride to the catalyst to enhance its acidity.
Finally, the last step in the regeneration process is the reduction of the metals on the
catalyst and sulﬁding, if necessary. This is done in a dry hydrogen atmosphere. Atthe temperatures required for reduction, greater than 350
◦C, high moisture levels can
lead to platinum agglomeration. Since water is formed in the reduction process asplatinum oxide is reduced to platinum metal, water is drained from the unit duringreduction. The reduction hydrogen is recirculated at as high a rate as possible in orderto minimize moisture content.
Sulﬁding is typically done by injection of H
2S or of an organic sulﬁde into the unit at
the end of reduction. Sulﬁding is continued until the speciﬁed sulfur level is reached
or until sulfur is no longer adsorbed by the catalyst and is detected at the outlet of thecatalyst bed.
Reactor performanceThe major process variables that affect unit performance are reactor pressure, reactor
temperature, space velocity, H
2/HC molar ratio, and catalyst type. The relationship
between the variables and process performance is generally applicable to both SR andcontinuous regeneration modes of operation.
The reactor pressure declines across the various reaction stages. The change in reactor"
"pressure across the unit, known as pressure drop, can be quite high for high-pressurereforming units, often 50–60 psig or more. The average reactor operating pressure isgenerally referred to as reactor pressure. For practical purposes, a close approximation230 CHAPTER 5
is the last reactor inlet pressure. The reactor pressure affects reformer yields, reactor
temperature requirements, and catalyst stability.
Practical operating constraints have led to a historical range of operating pressures
from 345 to 4,830 kPa (50–700 psig). Decreasing the reactor pressure increaseshydrogen and reformate yields, decreases the required temperature to achieve productquality, and shortens the catalyst cycle because it increases the catalyst coking rate. Thehigh catalyst deactivation rate associated with lower operating pressure requires CCR.
The primary control for product quality in catalytic reforming is the temperature of
the catalyst beds. Platforming catalysts are capable of operating over a wide range oftemperatures. By adjusting the heater outlet temperatures, a reﬁner can change theoctane of the reformate and the quantity of the aromatics produced.
The reactor temperature can be expressed as the weighted average inlet temperature
(WAIT). The WAIT is the summation of the product of the fraction of catalyst ineach reactor multiplied by the inlet temperature of the reactor. The weighted averagebed temperature (WABT) is also used to describe catalyst temperature and is thetemperature of the catalyst integrated along the catalyst bed. Temperatures in thischapter refer to the WAIT calculation. Typically, SR Platforming units have a WAITrange of 490–525
◦C (914–977◦F). CCR Platforming units operate at a WAIT of 525–
540◦C (977–1,004◦F). CCR Platforming units operate at even higher temperatures to
produce a more aromatic-rich, high-octane product. The amount of naphtha processedover a given amount of catalyst over a set length of time is referred to as space velocity.Space velocity corresponds to the reciprocal of the residence time or time of contactbetween reactants and catalyst. When the hourly volume charge rate of liquid naphthais divided by the volume of catalyst in the reactors, the resulting quotient, expressed inunits of h
−1, is the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV). Typical commercial LHSV
range from 1 to 3 with the volumetric rates measured at standard conditions (60◦F
and 1 atm.abs.).
Alternatively, if the weight charge rate of naphtha is divided by the weight of catalyst,
the resulting quotient, also expressed in units of h−1, is the weight hourly space
velocity (WHSV). Whether LHSV or WHSV is used is based on the customary waythat feed rates are expressed at a given location. Where charge rates are normallyexpressed in barrels per stream day, LHSV is typically used. Where the rates areexpressed in terms of metric tons per day, WHSV is preferred.
The combination of space velocity and reactor temperature is used to set the octane
of the product. The greater the space velocity, the higher the temperature required toproduce a given product octane. If reﬁners wish to increase the severity of a reformeroperation, they can either increase reactor temperature or lower the space velocity bydecreasing the reactor charge rate.CATAL YTIC REFORMING 231
The hydrogen-to-hydrocarbon (H 2/HC) mol ratio is the ratio of mols of hydrogen in
the recycle gas to mols of naphtha charged to the unit. The recycle gas is a mixture of
hydrogen and light gases, typically 75–92 mol% hydrogen. The ratio of total recyclegas to hydrocarbon is sometimes called the gas-to-oil ratio. Recycle hydrogen isnecessary to maintain catalyst-life stability by sweeping coke precursors from thecatalyst metals. The exact mechanism is proposed to be hydrogenation and inhibitionof polymerization. The rate of coke formation on the catalyst is a function of thehydrogen partial pressure present. Increasing the H
2/HC ratio increases the hydrogen
partial pressure and removes coke precursors from the metal sites, thereby increasingstability with little effect on product quality or yields.
Except for units designed for continuous regeneration through the circulation of the
catalyst between the reactors and the regenerator, catalytic reforming units normallywill require a shutdown for regeneration every 6–12 months. This relatively longcycle can be obtained by operating under milder conditions of high partial pressure ofhydrogen, lower reactor temperatures, and lower octane products. Continuous unitsoperate under severe conditions to yield high octane, high aromatics production, atlow hydrogen partial pressures, and higher reactor temperatures. Different catalystsare used depending on the application.
Semi regenerative reformers make use of catalysts the contain platinum or plat-"
"inum modiﬁed by rhenium or, to a lesser extent, iridium. The support is most of-ten gamma alumina, although there have been uses of eta alumina (4). Rheniumor iridium is used to enhance the life of the catalyst over that observed for Pt-onlycatalysts. All these catalysts are typically sulﬁded to minimize metal-catalyzed hy-drogenolysis reactions that produce light gases and reduce gasoline yield. Additionalcomponents were used on catalysts commercialized in the 1990’ s. The use of twocatalysts in a SR unit; one catalyst in the front reactors and another catalyst in theback reactors to provide maximum yield, activity, and stability was commercialized in1994 (8).
There are two main shapes of catalysts, cylindrical and spherical. The cylindrical
catalysts are usually extruded alumina. The spherical catalysts may be formed througha dropping method or by rolling wet, soft alumina dough. In some instances, factorssuch as the resistance to ﬂow or ﬂow distribution concerns may cause one form tobe chosen over the other. The density of the catalysts may vary from approximately0.5–0.8 g/cm
3. The variability in density allows the reﬁner to load more pounds of
catalyst in a unit, should additional catalyst activity or stability be desired.
The process of moving catalyst from the reactors to the regenerator and back re-
quires the use of spherical catalysts, rather than extrudate, to avoid catalyst dustingand breakage. Continuous regeneration units are operated at high severity and lowpressures to produce the greatest amount of aromatics and hydrogen possible. The232 CHAPTER 5
catalyst is circulated at a rate such that it corresponds to about one regeneration per
week or even at a greater frequency if needed due to the rapid deactivation under theseconditions.
Typical catalysts used in these units had a composition of platinum and tin on gamma
alumina. The tin was used to reduce the hydrogenolysis activity of the platinum andto improve yields. The reduction in metal-catalyzed cracking is also considered tostabilize the catalyst relative to platinum only. Currently, new proprietary catalystsare used to increase yields, lower coke make, or allow higher throughput (9).
Process ﬂow schemes
Fixed bed semiregenerative reformingA typical SR Platforming ﬂow diagram is presented in Figure 5.6. Feed to the unit
is mixed with recycled hydrogen gas, raised to the reaction temperature ﬁrst by afeed-efﬂuent combined feed exchanger and then by a ﬁred heater, and then charged to

the reactor section. Because most of the reactions that occur in the Platforming process
are endothermic, the reactor section is separated into several stages, or reactors.Interheaters are installed between these stages to maintain the desired temperaturerange across the catalyst in the reactor section. Efﬂuent from the last reactor is cooledby the feed-efﬂuent heat exchanger for maximum heat recovery. Air or water coolingprovides additional cooling to near-ambient temperature. The efﬂuent is then chargedto the separation section, where the liquid and gas products are separated. A portion ofthe gas from the separator is compressed and recycled back to the reactor section. Thenet hydrogen produced is sent to hydrogen users in the reﬁnery complex or for use asfuel. The separator liquid is pumped to a product stabilizer, where the more-volatilelight hydrocarbons are fractionated from the high-octane liquid product.
Fixed bed cyclic reformingCyclic reforming is similar to SR reforming, but an additional reactor replaces one
of the primary reactors while that reactor is being regenerated. The frequency withwhich a particular primary reactor is replaced and regenerated depends upon its rateof deactivation. Large diameter valves and piping are used to vary the process ﬂowbetween reactors.
Platforming process with continuous catalyst regenerationIn parallel with bimetallic catalyst improvements and other process and regeneration
advances, UOP began to develop the CCR Platforming™ process (Figure 5.7). In theCCR Platforming unit, partially aged catalyst in the reactors is continuously replacedwith catalyst that has been freshly regenerated in an external regenerator (CCR section)to maintain a low average age for the reactor catalyst. Thus, the high selectivityand high activity characteristics associated with new catalyst can be maintained atsigniﬁcantly higher severities than with the SR Platforming process. For example, aSR Platforming unit operates at a severity that steadily builds coke up on the catalystsurface over the length of a cycle (6–18 months), at which point the unit is shutdown and the catalyst regenerated. Throughout the cycle, yields decline. Instead, in amodern CCR Platforming unit, the catalyst is regenerated approximately every threeto seven days and the yield does not decline."
"The ability to continuously regenerate a controlled quantity of catalyst is the signiﬁcant
innovation of the CCR Platforming unit. The catalyst ﬂows by gravity from the lastreactor into a catalyst collector vessel. The catalyst is lifted by either nitrogen orhydrogen lifting gas to a catalyst hopper above the regeneration tower. Catalyst thenﬂows to the regeneration tower, where the catalyst is reconditioned. Regeneratedcatalyst is returned to the top of the reactor stack by a transfer system similar tothat used in the reactor-to-regenerator transfer. Thus, the reactors are continuouslysupplied with freshly regenerated catalyst, and product yields are maintained at fresh234 CHAPTER 5
Figure 5.7. CCR Platforming process (reprinted with permission from UOP LLC).
catalyst levels. The regeneration and reactor sections of the unit are easily isolated to
permit a shutdown of the regeneration system for normal inspection or maintenancewithout interrupting of the Platforming operation.
A few years after the introduction of the UOP CCR Platforming process, another con-
tinuously regenerable process design was offered by the Institut Fran¸ cais du P´ etrole.Though similar to CCR Platforming, the continuous reforming units designed by theInstitut Fran¸ cais du P´ etrole differ most notably in that the reactors are located side-
by-side and the catalyst transfer is effected through transfer piping between reactors.
Advantages of CCR Platforming
From both an economic and technical standpoint, the CCR Platforming process is
superior to the SR and cyclic reforming processes. The CCR Platforming unit allowsfor low-pressure operation, leading to higher yields. At these conditions, the SRPlatforming catalyst is completely deactivated after only a few days of operation.Both the hydrogen and C
5+yields are maximized with the CCR Platforming process.
Since the number of cyclic reformers is small relative to CCR Platforming processunits and SR process units, the following comparison will focus on contrasting CCRPlatforming units and SR units.CATAL YTIC REFORMING 235

High yields and constant yields are important in the economics of reforming. As
the catalyst is deactivated by coke deposition in the SR Platforming process, theyields begin to decline. With the CCR Platforming process, the reformate, aromatics,and hydrogen yields remain consistent and constant. This is particularly importantfor downstream users. The CCR section ensures proper redispersion of the metalsand chloride balance to maintain fresh catalyst activity. CCR Platforming units havehigher on-stream efﬁciency and are able to handle upset scenarios without long-termshutdown or signiﬁcant decline in performance.
Table 5.6 shows the relative operating severities for the SR and CCR Platforming
units. The CCR Platforming unit operates at higher severity and lower reactor catalystinventory. In addition, the CCR unit runs continuously compared to 12-month SRPlatforming cycle lengths.
Typical product yields for the SR and CCR Platforming units operating at the con-
ditions presented in Table 5.6 are shown in Table 5.7. Many of the beneﬁts ofCCR Platforming are demonstrated in Table 5.7. More and higher-purity hydro-gen is produced. The higher severity of the CCR Platforming unit results in simi-lar liquid volume for the two units. However, the reformate produced by the CCRPlatforming is more valuable than that produced by the SR Platforming unit. Tak-ing into account both the higher octane value and the increased on-stream efﬁciencyof the CCR Platforming unit, 80 million more octane-barrels, or 11.4 million more

A summary of the operating revenues and costs expected for the SR and CCR Plat-"
"forming units in shown in Table 5.8. The nomenclature follows standard deﬁnitions.The economics of the CCR Platforming process are superior as a direct result of thedifferences in operating severity and ﬂexibility of the two modes of operations. TheCCR Platforming unit produces more valuable reformate at 102 RONC versus the SRPlatforming reformate at 97 RONC. On-stream efﬁciency of the CCR Platformingunit is 8,640 hr per year compared to about 8,000 hr per year for the SR Platformingunit. Although the CCR Platforming utility costs are higher than those for the SRPlatforming unit, these costs are offset by the increase in both product quantity andvalue as demonstrated by pretax proﬁt and return on investment.

Fluid catalytic cracking
Warren Letzsch∗
Crude oil comprises hundreds of molecules that boil over a wide temperature range.
The lighter products can be separated directly by distillation into LPG, gasoline,naphtha, kerosene, and diesel fuels. Heavier products (BP >650
◦F/344◦C) include
vacuum gas oils and resids. Thermal and catalytic cracking processes in petroleumreﬁning reduce the molecular weight of these heavier constituents and produce morevaluable lighter products such as LPG, gasoline and diesel fuels.
Catalytic cracking was ﬁrst commercialized in 1936 by Eugene Houdry. This ﬁxed bed
process was a major improvement over the thermal cracking processes it replaced dueto the improved yield distribution and superior product properties. Multiple vesselswere utilized that alternated between cracking, stripping, regeneration, and purgecycles. This conﬁguration was quickly replaced by a moving bed reactor and a separateregenerator or kiln that ﬁrst used a bucket lift to move the pelleted catalyst followedlater by a pneumatic air lift system. The last of these units was built around 1960.
Standard Oil of New Jersey developed their own cracking process rather than pay the
large royalty being asked at the time. They commercialized the ﬂuid catalytic cracking(FCC) process in three years, starting in 1939 and culminating in 1942 with the start-up of PCLA#1 at their Baton Rouge, Louisiana reﬁnery. The inherent superiority ofthe ﬂuid process to transfer both heat and catalyst ultimately made it the catalyticcracking process of choice.
Many different designs of ﬂuid catalytic crackers have been introduced over the years.
Table 6.1 is a list of the various FCCU conﬁgurations and the approximate year oftheir commercial introduction.
Fluid catalytic cracking has evolved considerably over the more than 60 years since
its inception. As seen in Figure 6.1 these changes have encompassed all aspects of

"The initial units (1940s) were tall, had dense bed reactors and were made of carbon
steel. Dilute phase catalyst coolers and regenerator steam coils were employed to limitthe regenerator temperatures. Recycle rates of 100–150% were needed to achieve thedesired conversions. Later designs (late 1940s to early 1950s) were undertaken toreduce the height of the crackers, make them more compact and cater to the manysmall reﬁners around the United States.
In the late 1950s side by side designs with straight feed risers were introduced to im-
prove gasoline selectivity. Residue cracking in ﬂuid cracking units was ﬁrst practicedin the early 1960s. This unit was designed for 100% atmospheric bottoms and hadlarge amounts of heat removal.
Catalytic cracking was truly revolutionized in the early 1960s with the advent of zeo-
lite containing ﬂuid cracking catalysts. Catalyst activities were raised by an order ofFLUID CATAL YTIC CRACKING 241

magnitude and units needed to be redesigned to take full advantage of the new catalyst
technology. These design changes included the elimination of reactor dense beds andthe use of the feed riser as the sole conversion vessel. Recycle was greatly reducedand replaced with more fresh feed. It was found that coke left on the regeneratedcatalyst impaired the catalyst’ s activity and selectivity and the average carbons onregenerated catalyst were reduced from 0.3–0.5 wt% to 0.1 wt% or less. CompleteCO combustion in the regenerator was introduced to provide the needed regener-ator burning conditions which necessitated higher regenerator temperatures. Alloyinternals replaced the carbon steel and chrome-moly hardware in the regenerator andthe regenerated catalyst standpipe. Catalyst inventories were minimized due to thefavorable coke burning kinetics and modiﬁcations in the regenerator design (1970s).
In the early 1980s several new resid cracking designs were introduced. The spent
catalyst regeneration was staged in these designs and dense bed catalyst coolers wereoptional. These coolers have also been placed with single stage regenerators forresidual catalytic cracking units. The growth of this segment of the catalytic crackingprocess is shown in Figure 6.2. Over two million barrels per day of on purposeresid crackers have now been licensed and another million barrels of FCC capacityprocesses some resid along with their normal gas oils.

While the oleﬁns in gasoline have become a concern in the gasoline pool, the light
oleﬁns for petrochemicals are a valuable product, often exceeding the revenue ob-tained for transportation fuels. As a consequence, distinctive processes for makingmuch larger amounts of propylene than a normal FCC unit have been developed. TheDeep Catalytic Cracking Process (1991) was the ﬁrst commercial scale process thatwas designed to maximize propylene. Specially formulated catalysts, more severeprocess conditions and equipment made to handle the unique product distributionare all components of this technology. Table 6.3 compares the yields from the DCCtechnology with those obtained in a normal FCCU. Commercial yields have veriﬁedthe laboratory data.

Even more severe cracking conditions are used in the Catalytic Pyrolysis Process
(2002), where the desire is to produce all petrochemical products, i.e. ethylene, propy-lene, butenes, and aromatics. This process is really a substitute for a steam crackingfurnace in an ethylene plant. It allows the operator to use cheaper feedstocks andvary the ratio of ethylene to propylene over a wider range than is possible with onlythermal cracking."

catalyst/vapor separator. The hot catalyst is discharged into the catalyst stripper while
the vapor is routed through secondary cyclones to remove any remaining catalyst andthen to the main fractionator and gas plant for separation of the products.
The spent catalyst enters a multi-stage stripper where the absorbed hydrocarbons are
displaced with steam and leave with the product from the overhead of the reactor.This prevents unwanted hydrocarbons from entering the regenerator, consuming airand possibly causing excessive catalyst deactivation. Staging is accomplished bythe use of bafﬂes or packing and is similar in concept to a multi-tray distillationtower.
Spent-stripped catalyst enters the regenerator where the coke is burned off the catalyst
to restore its activity. The heat generated in the combustion process can supply allof the needed heat for the process. If excess heat is produced it can be removed byexternal catalyst coolers. The regenerated catalyst ﬂows back to the base of the riserwhere the cycle is completed. Typical catalytic cracking units undergo 100–400 suchcycles a day.
There have been many advances in the ﬂuid catalytic cracking process. The high
capacities of a unit (typically a third of the crude oil a fuels reﬁnery runs goes to astandard gas oil FCC unit), and its positive inﬂuence on overall reﬁnery economicshas made it a prime target for innovation. A list of most of the major innovations in theprocess is given in Table 6.4. These include catalyst, equipment and process changesthat have occurred on a continual basis over the 60 years that FCCUs have beenoperating. By being able to both improve its performance and evolve its functions,the catalytic cracking process has remained a staple in the modern reﬁnery.
Fluidization
The basic circulating, ﬂuid bed reactor system that is widely used today in many
other applications got its start in ﬂuid catalytic cracking. It was the development ofthe standpipe that made the process possible. The ﬁne powder acts as a ﬂuid whencontacted with a gas and it is the standpipe that allows the catalyst to be circulated froma vessel at lower pressure to one of higher pressure, thus completing the circulatingcatalyst loop.
In Figure 6.4, the head gain from the ﬂuidized catalyst is given as a function of the bed
density. The latter depends on the catalyst properties, the amount of aeration beingused and the rate at which catalyst is being added to the system.
The change in density of a bed of cracking catalyst with gas velocity is shown in Fig-

the upward force of the gas balances the weight of the catalyst (minimum ﬂuidiza-
tion velocity) and the catalyst becomes suspended in the gas. More gas expands theﬂuidized bed to a point where the next bit of gas enters and forms bubbles. Thisis the minimum bubbling velocity and the two phases are referred to as the emul-sion and bubble phases, respectively. Once bubbles are formed all of the added gas

"contributes to this phase. At even moderate velocities the catalyst is entrained with
the gas and must be captured and returned to the bed. This allows operation of thecatalyst beds at much higher superﬁcial velocities than would otherwise be possible.Typical velocities in the reactor-regenerator system are given in Table 6.5.
Bubbles play a key part in the operation of a ﬂuid bed system. They are the ‘engine’
that stirs the bed of catalyst making the high heat and mass transfer rates possible. Inthe standpipes bubbles can have a profound effect on the smoothness of catalyst ﬂowand care must be exercised to avoid over-aerating as well as under-aerating the catalyst.A formula for adding the proper amount of air to a standpipe, Q, was presented by

Typically 70% of the above calculated aeration rate is about optimum and it should be
added at even intervals, around the standpipe, about six to eight feet apart. Fine-tuningis done once the unit is in operation and a single gauge pressure survey can be takento aid in the operation of the system. It is critical that the catalyst be properly ﬂuidizedentering the standpipe since reﬂuidizing catalyst is very difﬁcult. Over-aeration is amore common problem than under aeration in commercial operations.
Process control
While there are a number of ways to conﬁgure the controls of the cat cracker, Fig-
ure 6.6 shows the typical scheme used in the industry for a slide valve controlled unit.
The reactor pressure is controlled by the inlet pressure to the wet gas compressor
but the actual pressure at the top of the reactor in the dilute phase is this pressureplus the pressure drop taken through the main fractionator overhead system, the mainfractionator and the reactor overhead system (cyclones, plenum, and overhead vaporline). At steady state this pressure should be constant. The regenerator pressure iscontrolled by the ﬂue gas slide valve and is maintained to give a constant differentialpressure between the reactor and regenerator. This is adjusted to provide optimumcatalyst circulation, adequate pressure drops across the control valves and to balancethe wet gas compressor and air blower.
The reactor temperature is controlled by the regenerated catalyst slide valve. More
hot catalyst is circulated to raise the reactor temperature or accommodate increased248 CHAPTER 6
feedrates. The feed going to the unit is preheated by exchange with the hot products.
While heat exchange is adequate for feed temperatures ranging up to about 500◦F, a
ﬁred heater is included for higher temperatures.
The regenerator temperature is a function of the coke on the catalyst entering the
regenerator, its composition and the mode of coke burning. Full combustion or thecomplete burning of the carbon to CO
2is most common due to the necessity of
limiting the CO concentration in the ﬂue gas to 500 ppm or less to meet environmentalregulations. Partial combustion resulting in CO/CO
2ratios ranging up to one are
practiced in units that do not have the needed metallurgy in the regenerator to operateat high temperatures or wish to maximize regenerator coke burning capacity or limitthe heat produced in the regeneration process. Such units are equipped with COincinerators or boilers where the CO is converted to CO
2before being discharged to
the atmosphere. Typical regenerator temperatures in these two operating modes are1150–1250
◦F (620–675◦C) and 1275–1350◦F (690–732◦C), respectively for partial
and complete combustion.
The spent catalyst slide valve controls the catalyst level in the stripper or reactor bed
if one is being used. No direct control of the regenerator catalyst bed level is made andits level ﬂoats depending on the catalyst losses and the catalyst withdraw and additionpolicies. Most units are capable of retaining most of the fresh catalyst added daily andmust periodically withdraw equilibrium catalyst to keep the regenerator level fromgetting too high. The regenerator is used as the ‘ﬂoating’ vessel because it is largerand it is desirable to withdraw regenerated rather than spent catalyst.
With the advent of computers and advanced process controllers, many reﬁnements"
"to the basic scheme are possible. The biggest beneﬁts come from operating closer toseveral limits at one time. Better analysis of the feedstocks could allow feed-forwardcontrol in the future. While these control systems can improve reﬁning proﬁtabilityfrom 20 to 40 cents/barrel processed, they require more instrumentation, which mustbe maintained to achieve the stated beneﬁts.
Reaction chemistry and mechanisms
Many studies have been performed elucidating the difference between thermal and
catalytic cracking. Two separate reaction mechanisms are attributed to the methodsof cracking, i.e., thermal cracking goes through free radicals and catalytic crackingvia carbenium ions. The latter are generally associated with the bronsted acid siteson the catalyst. In Table 6.6, the major differences between the two mechanisms areshown. Thermal cracking is minimized as much as possible in current FCC units bythe use of advanced equipment such as radial feed injectors, riser termination devicesand post riser quench. Catalyst selection is also critical.FLUID CATAL YTIC CRACKING 249

There are many reactions that occur during the cracking process. These are listed
below as primary or secondary reactions (Table 6.7). Most of the secondary reactionsare undesirable and are controlled through reactor and catalyst design. Numerouscracking reactions occur with the large feed molecules before the desired productsare achieved. Typical feeds to a catalytic cracking unit contain molecules boiling abovethe diesel end point (650–700
◦F or 343–371◦C) and may boil as high as 1500◦F . The

While this is an over simpliﬁcation of what occurs, it does give an overall view to
the cracking process. From the above equation it is clear that separate processes orapplications can center around either product or feed differences.
As such, there are three basic catalytic cracking applications, today. These are:

The driving forces behind these applications are the need for gasoline, the lack ofdemand for bottom of the barrel and the increase in demand for light oleﬁns and aro-matics. The technologies for each of these process conﬁgurations are reviewed in turn.
Gas oil cracking technology features
Reaction technologiesAll of the reaction systems offered today consist of a feed injection system, reactor
riser, riser termination device, and sometimes vapor quench technology. Each licensorapproaches the design with different equipment and conﬁgurations.
The feed injection system is probably the most important part of the reaction system
since it provides the initial contacting between the oil and catalyst. A good system mustvaporize the feed quickly, quench the hot catalyst as fast as possible and provide plugﬂow of the hydrocarbons and catalyst. Other features are important but are beyondthis limited description.
The hot-regenerated catalyst generally comes to the feed riser either through a wye"
"section or a J-bend depending on the proximity of the regenerated catalyst standpipeand the feed riser (see Figure 6.7). Feed nozzles are usually located from 10 to 30ft downstream of the base of the riser. Since raising the nozzles increases the backpressure on the regenerated catalyst slide valve, lift gas may be incorporated to controlthe pressure balance and minimize the back-mixing of the catalyst. The lift gas isnormally light gas from the product recovery section and adds to the load in the mainfractionator and wet gas compressor. Steam is sometimes substituted either whole orin part to reduce the processed gas but can cause some catalyst deactivation if theregenerator temperature gets too high.FLUID CATAL YTIC CRACKING 251
J-BendWye Section
Figure 6.7. Regenerated catalyst/feed contacting conﬁgurations.
The feed injection systems (Figure 6.8) employed by the various licensors all use
different nozzle designs. Oil pressure and dispersion steam rates vary by both licensorand application. Typical oil pressure drops and dispersion steam rates are 30–150 psiand 1–7 wt% and depend on the type of feedstock processed, i.e. vacuum gas oils orresidual feeds (BP >1050
◦C (565◦C)).
The feed injection systems being offered by the licensors are shown in Figure 6.8.
These are all two ﬂuid nozzles that mix an oil feed and steam and distribute them
across the riser cross-sectional area. Differences exist in the methods of contacting thesteam and oil, the amount of steam and pressures used and in the tip design. Reﬁnersare concerned about both performance and reliability when choosing a system.
Reactors are vertical pipes that are generally straight and are about 100 ft long. The
diameters at each end are controlled to give adequate lift to the catalyst. Velocitiesof 20–30 ft/sec at the base and 50–65 ft/sec at the vapor outlet are typical with vaporresidence times of about 2 sec based on the vapor outlet velocity. Bends in the riserpipe do not change the vapor residence time but increases the catalyst residence time(or slip) and usually results in poorer oil/catalyst contacting.
A termination or separation system is used at the top of the riser. These have been
simple Tee’ s, rough cut cyclones or specialized inertial separators. Most recently theriser termination devices have been close-coupled cyclones, linear disengagers, riserseparator strippers, or vortex separators. These are pictured in Figure 6.9 and all canbe or are directly connected to the secondary cyclones.252 CHAPTER 6

below 505◦C (941◦F), the impact of the dilute phase is small and the use of advanced
termination technology is difﬁcult to justify especially if there is a chance of downtime
due to equipment malfunction. The value of Kcan be determined for an individual
unit by measuring the amount of dry gas produced at two different temperatures andmeasuring the vapor residence time with tracers. A number of factors can add to thedry gas make such as catalyst type, feed properties, the amount of dilute phase catalystand carbon on regenerated catalyst.
Another approach to reducing the post gas dry gas make is to reduce the temperature at
the end of the riser. This has been done at the end of the riser before the separator andjust downstream of the catalyst/vapor separator at the end of the riser. Quenching inthe riser will reduce gas make and may be needed if there is a metallurgical limit in thereactor-stripper vessel. However, the amount of quench is high due to the catalyst that iscooled and the stripper must operate at a lower temperature. The coke make and air re-quirements are increased since this is a recycle stream from a heat balance perspective.
Downstream quenching only cools the vapor and does not add to the coke yield. It"
"can be applied to any unit that has a rapid/effective catalyst/vapor separator as shownin Figure 6.11. The quench material is taken from the main fractionator and froma heat balance perspective acts the same as a pump around on the main column. Itcan be adjusted to accommodate changes in the reactor temperature and discontinuedat low temperatures. Beneﬁts from three different units are listed in Table 6.8. Asequation (3) implies and Figure 6.10 illustrates, the effects of time and temperatureare equivalent. However, the vapor quench also reduces the cracking that occurs in thesecondary cyclones, plenum changer and overhead vapor line. Care must be exercisedwhen using quench to avoid coke formation. These precautions include the choice ofthe quench medium, operating above minimum operating temperatures and automaticshut-offs and purges.FLUID CATAL YTIC CRACKING 255

Stripping technology
After the cracking reactions are completed, the spent catalyst needs to be stripped of
the hydrocarbons that would accompany it to the regenerator. This is done in a staged-ﬂuidized bed where steam enters from the bottom and pushes the hydrocarbons inthe gas phase out of the top of the bed. Design parameters for new units are given inFigure 6.12, which is a common disk and donut design.
The bafﬂes improve contacting between the steam and catalyst and increases the
number of contacting stages. As shown in Figure 6.13, seven stages of stripping issufﬁcient to remove at least 95% of the hydrocarbons. Each of the design parametersare important to the proper operation of the stripper. A minimum amount of steam isnecessary to displace the hydrocarbons in the emulsion and bubble phases of the ﬂuidbed. The ﬂux rate determines the catalyst velocity through the bed. If the downwardvelocity of the catalyst gets too high, it will sweep hydrocarbons and steam with itand adversely affect the stripper performance. The residence time is a function of thestripper’ s catalyst inventory and the catalyst circulation rate and relates to the numberof stages and their efﬁciency that the stripper can obtain.

While the disk and donut design shown has proven to be both reliable and effective,
there are other variations on this design. Holes can be placed in the bafﬂes to improvecontacting, the skirts can be lengthened to provide a larger gas /Delta1P, vent tubes have
been used to allow the gas from the bottom of the bafﬂes to pass to the next stage androds or shed decks can be substituted as the contacting devices. The use of structuredpacking has been reported recently with excellent results. Lower steam usage, bettercontacting, and utilization of almost the entire cross-sectional area of the stripper arebeneﬁts claimed with the new design. Horizontal trays with small holes conﬁgured asdistillation trays have been tested in the lab and will also be implemented in the ﬁeld.
Regeneration technology
The object of the regenerator is to remove the coke that builds up on the catalyst in the
reactor without damaging the catalyst. Many studies have been made on the burningrates of coke in a ﬂuidized bed of cracking catalyst. Equation (4) describes the majorregeneration operating variables
dC
dt=K×Ci×LmO2×eA/RT(4)
The contacting between the oxygen and catalyst is improved signiﬁcantly as the airrate or superﬁcial velocity is increased in the regenerator. As the velocity increasesthe bed goes through three stages. A bubbling bed occurs at low superﬁcial velocities(up to about 1.5 ft/sec or 46 cm/sec). Here relatively distinct bubbles are formed andpass through the bed. A turbulent bed (1.5–4.0 ft/sec or 46–122 cm/sec) exists athigher superﬁcial velocities in which an emulsion is formed and the diffusion rate ofoxygen is signiﬁcantly increased. At higher velocities a fast-ﬂuidized bed (4–8 ft/secor 122–244 cm/sec) exists in which turbulence is maximized. A return line from therecovered catalyst to the combustor is required to provide enough residence time and aFLUID CATAL YTIC CRACKING 257

"sufﬁcient mix temperature for the coke to completely burn. The difference in burning
rates between these idealized regenerator designs is shown in Figure 6.14.
A few observations can be made from Figure 6.14 and equation (4). At high tem-
peratures (>1,300◦Fo r7 0 4◦C) the burning rate is very high. Oxygen availability
limits the burning rate though the small size of the ﬂuid cracking catalyst eliminatesor minimizes diffusion as a reaction barrier at normal regenerator temperatures. Theplug ﬂow curve moves up, as catalyst is recycled in the combustor since the effect isto increase the residence time. Regenerators with larger inventories will reduce thecarbon satisfactorily even if there is a partial malfunction of the air distributor whilesmaller inventories allow faster change outs of the catalyst inventory. Over the years,the regenerator temperatures have increased due to better metallurgy and the needto burn all of the carbon off the catalyst to restore the zeolite catalysts’ activity andproduct selectivity.
At 1,100
◦F (593◦C) the regenerator inventories had to be large to provide enough time
to burn the coke. Full CO combustion raised these temperatures to 1,300–1,350◦F
(704–732◦C). CO promoters are also frequently employed to assist the carbon burn
and prevent the afterburning of CO in the dilute phase or downstream hardware
where serious equipment damage can occur. The differences in catalyst inventory areillustrated in Table 6.9 for a 50,000 B/D unit that circulates between 30 and 40 tons/min of catalyst.258 CHAPTER 6

Shorter contact times and smaller catalyst inventories limit operable regeneration
conditions and need higher internal catalyst recycle rates for increased throughput orcoke burn. Since catalyst is frequently added on a pound per barrel basis each of theseunits would use about 5 tons/day of fresh catalyst. Equation (5) relates the catalystactivity to S, the daily fractional replacement rate or age of the catalyst:
A=A
OS
KD+S. (5)
This equation implies the smaller inventory would give the highest equilibrium or unitactivity. However, Kis also a function of the contacting between the spent catalyst
and air, the mix temperature, the catalyst type and activity and the number of cyclesthe catalyst makes through the system. This latter fact implies there is an optimumunit inventory for a given processing capacity.
Commercial regenerator designs are shown in Figure 6.15. These utilize either turbu-
lent beds or fast-ﬂuidized beds. Cocurrent or countercurrent contacting of the catalystand air is practiced and care is taken to prevent short-circuiting of the catalyst fromthe regenerator inlet to the outlet to ensure an even, low carbon distribution on theregenerated catalyst.
Resid catalytic cracking
Processing heavier feeds poses challenges to the normal FCC design due to the higher
coke laydown on the catalyst during the cracking reactions. The coke layed down inthe cracking process has been shown to come from four main sources as shown inTable 6.10.
The catalytic coke comes from the secondary cracking reactions and are caused by
polymerization and condensation of hydrocarbons. Strippable coke are the hydro-carbons that are entrained with the spent catalyst that enters the regenerator. Heavymetals that lay down on the catalyst surface promote dehydrogenation and lead toextra coke and hydrogen. Nickel, vanadium, and Iron are the main contaminatesthough occasionally copper, zinc, and lead have been known to cause problems. Feedcoke has been associated with the carbon residue in the feed as measured in theConradson Carbon Test (ASTM). This has been also referred to as additive coke.FLUID CATAL YTIC CRACKING 259

As Table 6.10 shows the sources of coke shift dramatically when resid is in the
feed. The percentages given in Table 6.10 are not ﬁxed and shift as the compositionof the feed and operating parameters change. The total coke make is different in eachcase. There are other factors that lead to coke formation that are included in the fourcategories. Basic nitrogen is known to cause coke since these molecules are stronglyadsorbed on the acid sites in the reactor and are burned off in the regenerator.

Some of the very heavy hydrocarbons in resid may not be vaporized and be laid
down on the catalyst surface where they eventually coke. Figure 6.16 shows that thepercentage of Conradson Carbon that goes to coke is a function of the feedstock andreactor temperature.
Both desorption of basic compounds and feedstock vaporization would be improved
by raising the reactor temperature (and consequently the stripper temperature) so therelationship shown in Figure 6.16 is directionally correct. The carbon laydown or deltacoke can be represented by equation (6).

The overall heat balance equation for any cracking unit is:

The dependent variable is the catalyst/oil ratio, which needs to be high enough togive the desired conversion. Weight percent coke is strictly a function of the operatingvariables (i.e. fresh feed and recycle rates, feed temperature, reactor temperature,steam rates, heat of cracking, air rates, and carbon burning mode).

designs. However, there are feed injectors designed speciﬁcally to process residualfeeds that require more dispersion steam than the normal gas oil models.

On the regenerator side, the two approaches are to use a single stage regenerator and
add a catalyst cooler or split the regenerator into two stages and make the catalystcoolers optional. The two stage designs offered differ in the sequence of catalyst ﬂowand how the air is introduced and utilized.
The Ashland/UOP design has the ﬁrst regenerator on top of the second. Spent catalyst
ﬂows into regenerator one, is partially regenerated and ﬂows to the second regeneratorwhere the carbon burn is completed. Air is introduced into both regenerators but theﬂue gas from number two passes up through arms into regenerator one. Entrainedcatalyst is carried with the ﬂue gas. All of the regeneration air goes through the topregenerator and a CO boiler to reduce the CO content of the ﬂue gas to permittedlevels.
Stone & Webster/Axens have reversed the regenerators so that the spent catalyst enters
the bottom regenerator and the partially regenerated catalyst is vertically conveyedwith lift air to regenerator two where the coke burn is ﬁnished. Air goes to bothregenerators and the catalyst lift line. The ﬂue gas from regenerator one contains COsince the regenerator is run with no excess oxygen. A CO incinerator or CO boiler isused to produce an acceptable ﬂue gas composition. Lift gas and the air to regeneratortwo are burned and exit the second regenerator and is recombined with the ﬂue gasfrom regenerator one. Several ﬂue gas combination schemes have been used.264 CHAPTER 6

The reason for splitting the regeneration is to produce CO rather than CO 2so that
the heat removal can be eliminated or reduced. Depending on the capacity of the
FCC Unit, the heat removal by this technique can reach 100 million BTUs per hour.Another beneﬁt is that the hydrogen in the coke burns faster than the carbon as shownin Figure 6.22. This hydrogen is the chief source of moisture in the regenerationprocess that has been shown to deactivate the catalyst. The carbon burn is typicallyadjusted so that 45–75% is accomplished in the ﬁrst stage.FLUID CATAL YTIC CRACKING 265

If even more heat removal is required one or more catalyst coolers can be added tothe top regenerator. The two basic designs used are shown in Figure 6.23.
Both are dense bed catalyst coolers. Dilute phase coolers were used in the past but
frequent leaks made them too unreliable to use for commercial applications. One ofthe designs features a shell and tube exchanger while the other has tube clusters thathave isolation valves. The latter is more expensive but allows isolation of the leakingcluster without shutting down the catalyst cooler. If steam leaks into the regeneratorunabated, excessive catalyst deactivation occurs. The advantage of a catalyst cooler

is that its duty can be varied over virtually its entire heat load range. This allows the
reﬁner to adjust the coke make to the feedstock and desired reaction severity.
Many early FCC units had steam coils but these must be run at full load to prevent a
mechanical failure. All of these systems require a high water to steam ratio to ensurevaporization does not occur in the regenerator coils or tubes, which leads to hot spotsand subsequent holes. Older heat removal systems were designed with coils and trimcoolers, but this concept has been rejected in modern resid crackers.
The demand for residual fuels has steadily declined and it is unlikely that it will ever
return. Consequently, residual catalytic cracking is a high growth area as shown inFigure 6.2.
Heavy fuel oil will not be sold without hydroprocessing in the future. Concern over
acid rain and the severe desulfurization required for transportation fuels will focusattention to all the other fuels (off-road diesel, bunkers, etc.) and make desulfuriza-tion mandatory. Reﬁners will ﬁnd feedstock preparation, while costly, will greatlyimprove overall yields and install hydroprocessing where the crude warrants. Forhigh metals laden crude or those deﬁcient in hydrogen, coking will be the preferredbottoms processing route followed by hydroprocessing of the coker gas oils or theFCC products.
Fluid cracking catalysts
The FCC process has been shaped and reshaped to accommodate the advances made
in ﬂuid cracking catalysts. Early catalysts were relatively inactive and amorphousin nature and required a lot of recycle of the uncracked feed to achieve the desiredconversions. Carbon on regenerated catalyst was usually around 0.3–0.6 wt% andhad little effect on unit performance. In the early 1960s zeolite containing catalystswere introduced that were much more active and selective than previous catalysts butrequired the removal of residual coke for optimum commercial performance. Thisallowed the reﬁner to substitute fresh feed for the large amounts of recycle being usedand resulted in greatly expanded capacity and gasoline yields.
The preferred FCC zeolite is a crystalline silica-alumina compound that has the
sodium removed. The Type Y or Ultrastable Y zeolite commonly employed has a fau-jasite structure and as produced formula as shown in Figure 6.24. The important prop-erties of these zeolites that make them suitable for use in ﬂuid cracking catalysts are:
rHigh stability (>1,600
◦F) to heat and steam
rThree-dimensional structure
rHigh activity (acidity)
rLarge pores (7.5 ˚A)FLUID CATAL YTIC CRACKING 267
Figure 6.24. Fautasite zeolite structure.
Without all these characteristics the zeolite will not standup to the high temperatures
in the regenerator or let in large molecules so that the interior of the crystal can beutilized. Rapid coking is mitigated by the three-dimensional structure. The acidity oractivity of the zeolite is associated with the hydroxyl groups attached to the aluminumatoms in the crystal structure.
The type of zeolites contained in ﬂuid cracking catalysts are variations of the basic"
"faujasite or Type Y zeolite structure. These are made and characterized as illustratedin equation (8). The products are referred to as Ultrastable Y’ s (US–Y), Hydrogen Y’ s(H-Y), Calcined Rare Earth Y (CREY) or Rare Earth Ultrastable Y (RE–US–Y). Eachof these has been used as the primary cracking component in commercial crackingcatalysts. Variations of the structures and compositions of the above products aremade by new methods of zeolite syntheses and secondary treatment. These includecontrolling the amount of alumina in the crystal structure and occluded in the zeolitespores, substituting other cat ions for alumina in the zeolite framework and using othercat ions for ion exchange to replace the sodium.

In Table 6.12 the effect of rare earth exchange of the Type Y zeolite used in FCC
catalysts is shown. Rare earths stabilize the zeolite and results in higher activity andmore hydrogen transfer. Coke selectivity declines along with the oleﬁnicity of theLPG and catalytic gasoline.
In commercial use, the zeolites undergo dealumination due to contacting with steam
at elevated temperatures such as those encountered in the regenerator. This is shownin Figure 6.25 where the dealumination is measured by x-ray defraction to obtain thecorresponding unit cell size of the zeolite crystal.
The commercial performance of the cracking catalyst depends on a number of factors,
but the equilibrium unit cell size of the catalyst is a principle variable. As illustrated

in Figure 6.26 many of the important properties of the catalyst are determined by this
number. The zeolite types tend to equilibrate around the levels shown but it should beunderstood that both hydrogen and rare earth can be used for exchange on the samezeolite to give to a mixed result.
As the aluminum atoms are removed from the zeolite structure the activity goes down
and much more zeolite needs to be used to give an equivalent conversion. Lower unitcell sizes increases C
3and C 4oleﬁnicity, gasoline octane, and reduces coke formation.
The catalyst’ s activity is measured by a standard laboratory (MAT) test. The basecatalyst without zeolite can have an activity as low as four MAT though numbersranging from 20 to 45 MAT are more typical. Commercial FCC operations haveactivities that range from 58 to 77 MAT with 62 to 72 being the most common range.
The matrix is the rest of the catalyst and contains clay, additives and/or a binder that
holds all the components together. Important properties such as the catalyst’ s attritioncharacteristics, density, CO burning rate, coke selectivity, bottoms cracking and drygas make are a direct function of the matrix composition.
Clay is used as ﬁller and provides some pore structure. Additives such as alumina
and silica-alumina are used to increase the matrix cracking activity and crack largemolecules. Binders can consist of silica, alumina or silica-alumina, and can alsoenhance activity. In the new catalysts, more than one additive can be incorporatedinto the catalyst and small amounts of secondary compounds such as titanium orphosphorous can modify the catalyst’ s performance.270 CHAPTER 6

Cracking for light oleﬁns and aromatics
The demand for propylene as a petrochemical feedstock is outpacing the need for
ethylene. As a result, the traditional source of propylene, i.e. as byproduct of thesteam cracker, is not sufﬁcient for future propylene projections.
Catalytic cracking is the other major source of the propylene with propane dehydro-
genation making up the balance. Worldwide market shares (2001) are 68:28:4, thoughrecently in the United States, catalytic cracking has overtaken steam cracking as thelargest single source of propylene used for petrochemicals.272 CHAPTER 6
By changing the catalyst formulation, operating parameters, and equipment design,
the product distributions shown in Table 6.3 are obtained. In the Deep CatalyticCracking Process, the yields of light oleﬁns (C
2–C4) and BTX aromatics are much
higher than in standard gas oil FCC units and can result in signiﬁcantly improvedprocessing economics. As shown in equation (2), this mode encourages the deliberateovercracking of gasoline.
Many international petrochemical producers are challenged with the need to obtain
secure, low cost naphtha supplies. Integrating petrochemical operations with reﬁneriescan ameliorate this situation. To become and remain competitive it is essential to haveaccess to low cost feedstocks and to build vertically integrated, strategically locatedworld scale reﬁnery and petrochemical complexes. Such integration adds value andprovides raw materials, both keys to gaining a competitive edge in global markets.In the case of increased propylene demand, heavier, less expensive feedstocks, i.e.gas oils can be used in a continuous catalytic process run at more favorable operatingconditions.
The product qualities of the naphtha from the Deep Catalytic Cracking Process are
compared to a conventional FCC unit and a steam cracker in Table 6.13. The higheraromatics concentration in the naphtha is mostly a result of the concentration ofexisting aromatics due to the cracking of the parafﬁns and cycloparafﬁns rather thanthrough dehydrogeneration of naphthenes or cyclization of parafﬁns. Xylenes arethe major aromatic compounds produced catalytically while benzene is the primarythermal product. Dioleﬁns are low in both of the catalytic processes since these resultfrom the largely absent thermal reactions.

A ﬂow diagram of the DCC process is shown in Figure 6.28. The catalyst ﬂow and oil
vapors and products follow the same path as the gas oil FCC unit described earlier.Considerably more steam is added and the reactor can be run with a bed level toincrease the hydrocarbon residence time and facilitate the overcracking reactions.Other options include recycling naphtha to the same feed riser or the installation of aseparate smaller riser to run at higher temperature.
Recracking of naphtha can optionally include the C
4oleﬁns. Further, the recycled
naphtha can be full range or cut to maximize the crackable molecules. The result of
the recycle is to increase propylene and the concentration of BTX in the naphtha.The product slates before and after naphtha recycle are shown in Table 6.14 from theJinan DCC unit.

A pilot plant test showed that when DCC naphtha with a 150◦C end point was recycled
the aromatics concentration increased dramatically. The total aromatics went from
42 to 81 wt% of the naphtha with the BTX content being 4.4, 28.9, and 40.4 wt%,respectively."
"Recent advances in the technology have been directed to expanding the feedstock
types that can be processed. Successfully run feeds now include:
rVGO
rHydrotreated VGO
rDeasphalted Oil
rDewaxing wax
rCoker gas oil
rAtmospheric resid
Catalyst formulations have had to be altered to match the changing feedstock slate.The DCC catalysts are designed with the following characteristics: high matrix ac-tivity for primary cracking of the heavy hydrocarbons and higher metals tolerance; alarge quantity of a modiﬁed mesopore zeolite with a pentasil structure for crackingthe primary product (gasoline), isomerization activity for the light oleﬁns and mini-mization of hydrogen transfer. Ten different catalysts have been used commerciallyin the seven operating DCC installations.
Representative yields from various commercial operations are tabulated in Table 6.15.
Parafﬁnic feedstocks give high propylene yields and the isobutylene concentrationin the C
4stream is near the thermodynamic limit. Atmospheric resid makes an ex-
cellent feed as long as it is parafﬁnic. The results from commercial runs on Daqingatmospheric resid are given in Table 6.16 along with the feedstock analysis. The com-bination of an ARDS unit in front of a DCC unit would allow a reﬁnery to processFLUID CATAL YTIC CRACKING 275

a wide variety of crudes and still produce high quantities of petrochemical base
stocks.
Other technologies designed to increase the propylene yield from heavy feeds have
been announced. Two such processes are the PetroFCC and Maxoﬁn. Neither of theprocesses has been commercialized to date but have been discussed in various papers.
The PetroFCC shown in Figure 6.29 has a recycle stream of spent catalyst from the
stripper to the base of the feed riser. The principle behind this design, as Table 6.17shows, is that spent catalyst is less active but somewhat more selective than the cleanregenerated catalyst at constant conversion.
This makes recycling spent catalyst an option which increases the effective catalyst/oil
ratio and reduces the initial regenerated catalyst activity.
The PetroFCC utilizes many of the same technologies that are used in the standard
UOP FCC units. This includes both the optimix nozzles and vortex separator system.

A second riser for recracking the naphtha is provided that operates at higher temper-

To enhance light oleﬁn production, low hydrocarbon partial pressures (10–30 psia),
elevated temperatures (1,000–1,150◦F) and 10–25 wt% of shape selective (pentasil
zeolites) additives are employed. Maximum oleﬁn yields require high conversionsince it is the gasoline produced in the cracking process that ultimately is made intopropylene and butylene.
Cited yields for the PetroFCC are (Table 6.18).While the feedstock properties and operating conditions are not known, the feedstock
had to be very parafﬁnic to yield such a high gasoline yield in the regular FCCprocessing mode.

Another process designed for high oleﬁn yields is the Maxoﬁn FCC. This unit is
shown in Figure 6.30 and has a second riser for propylene maximization. The processuses the Orthoﬂow FCC Hardware, e.g. atomax nozzles and close-connected cyclonesand the stacked reactor-regenerator conﬁguration. A special ZSM-5 additive is usedalong with the FCC catalyst.

As the need for light oleﬁns and LPG increases, these processes will assume even
more attention.
Catalytic cracking is well positioned as we enter a new decade of petroleum reﬁning."
"The continued demand for gasoline, the need to reduce the residual portion of the crudebarrel and an ever increasing thirst for petrochemical base stocks will insure a premierposition for the ﬂuid catalytic cracking unit in the reﬁning and petrochemical industry.

Distillate hydrocracking
Adrian Gruia (retired)*
Hydrocracking is a versatile catalytic reﬁning process that upgrades petroleum feed-
stocks by adding hydrogen, removing impurities, and cracking to a desired boilingrange. Hydrocracking requires the conversion of a variety of types of molecules and ischaracterized by the fact that the products are of signiﬁcantly lower molecular weightthan the feed. Hydrocracking feeds can range from heavy vacuum gas oils and cokergas oils to atmospheric gas oils. Products usually range from heavy diesel to lightnaphtha. Hydrocrackers are designed for and run at a variety of conditions dependingon many factors such as type of feed, desired cycle length, expected product slate butin general they will operate at the following range of conditions: liquid hourly spacevelocity (LHSV)—0.5 to 2.0, H
2circulation—5,000 to 10,000 SCFB (850–1,700
Nm3/m3), H 2PP—1,500 to 2,000 psia (103–138 bars), and SOR temperatures ranging
between 675◦F and 725◦F (357–385◦C). Hydrocracking is particularly well suited
to generating products that meet or exceed all of the present tough environmentalregulations.
Brief history
While the ﬁrst commercial installation of a unit employing the type of technology in
use today was started up in Chevron’ s Richmond CA reﬁnery in 1960, hydrocrackingis one of the oldest hydrocarbon conversion processes. Hydrocracking technologyfor coal conversion was developed in Germany as early as 1915 designed to securea supply of liquid fuels derived from domestic deposits of coal. The ﬁrst plant forhydrogenation of brown coal was put on stream in Leuna Germany in 1927, applyingwhat may be considered the ﬁrst commercial hydrocracking process. Conversionof coal to liquid fuels was a catalytic process operating at high pressures, 3000–10,000 psig (207–690 bar) and high temperatures, 700–1000
◦F (371–538◦C). Other
efforts were undertaken subsequently to develop hydrocracking technology designed

to convert heavy gas oils to lighter fuels. The emergent availability of Middle Eastern
crude after World War II removed the incentive to convert coal to liquid fuels, socontinuing the development of hydrocracking technology became less important.
In the mid-1950s the automobile industry started the manufacture of high-"
"performance cars with high-compression ratio engines that required high-octane gaso-line. Thus catalytic cracking expanded rapidly and generated, in addition to gasoline,large quantities of refractory cycle stock that was material that was difﬁcult to con-vert to gasoline and lighter products. This need to convert refractory stock to qualitygasoline was ﬁlled by hydrocracking. Furthermore, the switch of railroads from steamto diesel engines after World War II and the introduction of commercial jet aircraftin the late 1950s increased the demand for diesel fuel and jet fuel. The ﬂexibilityof the newly developed hydrocracking processes made possible the production ofsuch fuels from heavier feedstocks. The early hydrocrackers used amorphous silicaalumina catalysts. The rapid growth of hydrocracking in the 1960s was accompa-nied by the development of new, zeolite based hydrocracking catalysts. They showeda signiﬁcant improvement in certain performance characteristics as compared withamorphous catalysts: higher activity, better ammonia tolerance, and higher gasolineselectivity. While hydrocracking was used in the United States primarily in the pro-duction of high-octane gasoline, it grew in other parts of the world, starting in the1970s primarily for the production of middle distillates. The amorphous catalystsremained the catalysts of choice for this application, though some ‘ﬂexible’ catalystswere developed that made it possible to maximize the yield of different products byusing the same catalyst but changing the operating conditions. As of the beginningof 2001, there were more than 150 hydrocrackers operating in the world with a totalcapacity in excess of 3,800,000 B/D (500,000 MT/D).
Flow schemes
Various licensors have slightly different names for their hydrocracker ﬂow schemes,
but in general, they can be grouped into major two categories: single stage and twostage. Table 7.1 shows the general evolution of ﬂows schemes, generally driven byimprovements in catalysts.
Single stage once-through hydrocrackingFigure 7.1 shows a schematic of a single stage, once-through hydrocracking unit,
which is the simplest conﬁguration for a hydrocracker. It is a variation of the singlestage hydrocracking with recycle conﬁguration (described in “Two Stage RecycleHydrocracking”). The feed mixes with hydrogen and goes to the reactor. The efﬂuentgoes to fractionation, with the unconverted material being taken out of the unit as un-converted material. This type of unit is the lowest cost hydrocracking unit, can processDISTILLATE HYDROCRACKING 289

heavy, high boiling feed stocks and produces high value unconverted material which
becomes feed stock for FCC units, ethylene plants or lube oil units. In general, the con-version of the feed stock to products is 60–70 vol%, but can range as high as 90 vol%.
Single stage with recycle hydrocracking
The most widely found hydrocracking unit is the single stage with recycle in which
the unconverted feed is sent back to the reactor section for further conversion.
Figure 7.2 depicts this type of unit. It is the most cost-effective design for 100% (or
near 100%) conversion and is especially used to maximize diesel product.
A more detailed ﬂow diagram of the reactor section in a single stage hydrocracking
unit (than those shown in either Figures 7.1 and 7.2) is shown in Figure 7.3. Thefresh is passed downward through the catalyst in presence of hydrogen, after beingpreheated to reaction temperature by passing it through heat exchangers and a heater.The efﬂuent from the reactors goes through a series of separators where hydrogenis recovered and, together with make up hydrogen, is recycled to the reactors. Theliquid product is sent to fractionation where the ﬁnal products are separated fromunconverted oil. In once-through units, the unconverted oil is sent out of the unit,

as previously described. In units designed to operate with recycle, the unconverted"
"oil combines with the fresh feed, as shown in Figure 7.3. As described in the nextsection (“Chemistry”), the reaction section fulﬁlls two functions: pre-treating andcracking. This is shown in Figure 7.3 as separate reactors, though both functions canbe achieved in a single reactor when using amorphous catalyst. When using a pre-treat and cracking catalyst conﬁguration, the ﬁrst catalyst (a hydrotreating catalyst)converts organic sulfur and nitrogen from hetero compounds in the feedstock tohydrogen sulﬁde and ammonia, respectively. The deleterious effect of H
2S and NH 3
on hydrocracking catalysts is considerably less than that of the corresponding organichetero compounds. The hydrotreating catalyst also facilitates the hydrogenation ofaromatics. In the single stage, two-reactor conﬁguration, the products from the ﬁrst

reactor are passed over a hydrocracking catalyst in the second reactor where most of
the hydrocracking takes place. The conversion occurs in the presence of NH 3,H2S,
and small amounts of unconverted amounts of hetero compounds. The hydrotreatingcatalyst in the ﬁrst reactor is designed to convert the hetero compounds in the feedstock. Typically, such catalysts comprise sulﬁded molybdenum and nickel on aluminasupport. The reactor operates at temperatures varying from 570
◦Ft o8 0 0◦F (300–
425◦C) and hydrogen pressures between 1,250 and 2,500 psig (85–170 bar). Under
these conditions, in addition to heteroatom elimination, signiﬁcant hydrogenationoccurs, and some cracking also takes place. The cracking reactor operates at the samehydrogen pressures but at temperatures varying from 570 to as high as 840
◦F (300–
450◦C) for amorphous hydrocracking catalysts and up to 440◦C (825◦F) for zeolite
containing catalysts.
Two stage recycle hydrocracking
The two stage hydrocracking process conﬁguration is also widely used, especially for
large throughput units. In two stage units, the hydrotreating and some cracking takesplace in the ﬁrst stage. The efﬂuent from the ﬁrst stage is separated and fractionated,with the unconverted oil going to the second stage. The unconverted oil from thesecond stage reaction section goes back to the common fractionator. A simpliﬁedschematic of a two stage hydrocracker is shown in Figure 7.4. The catalysts in the ﬁrststage are the same types as those used in the single stage conﬁguration. The catalystin the second stage is operating in near absence of ammonia, and depending on theparticular design, in the absence or presence of hydrogen sulﬁde. The near absence ofNH
3and H 2S allows the use of either noble metal or base metal sulﬁde hydrocracking
catalysts.
Separate hydrotreat two stage hydrocracking
A variation of the typical two stage hydrocracking with common hydrogen circulation
loop is the separate hydrotreat hydrocracking shown in Figure 7.5 in which each stage292 CHAPTER 7

has a separate hydrogen circulation loop, allowing for operation of the second stage
in the near absence of hydrogen sulﬁde (and ammonia).
Chemistry
Hydrocracking converts the heavy feed stock to lower molecular weight products,
removes sulfur and nitrogen and saturates oleﬁns and aromatics. The organic sul-fur is transformed into H
2S, the nitrogen is transformed into NH 3and the oxygen
compounds (not always present) are transformed into H 2O. The reactions in hydroc-
racking can be classiﬁed in two categories: desirable and undesirable. Desirable arethe treating, saturation, and cracking reactions. Undesirable reactions are contaminantpoisoning as well as coking of the catalyst. There are two types of reactions takingplace in hydrocracking units: treating (also called pre-treating) and cracking (alsocalled hydrocracking). The cracking reactions require bi-functional catalyst, whichpossess a dual function of cracking, and hydrogenation.
Treating reactions
The treating reactions that will take place (if the respective contaminants are present)"
"are the following: sulfur removal, nitrogen removal, organo-metallic compound re-moval, oleﬁn saturation, oxygen removal, and halides removal. The ﬁrst three types ofcompounds are always present though in varying amounts depending on the source offeed stock. The others are not always present. In general, the treating reactions proceedin the following descending order of ease: (organo) metals removal, oleﬁn saturation,sulfur removal, nitrogen removal, oxygen removal, and halide removal. Some aromaticsaturation also occurs in the pre-treating section. Hydrogen is consumed in all treat-ing reactions. In general, the desulfurization reaction consumes 100–150 SCFB/wt%change (17–25 Nm
3/m3/wt% change) and the denitrogenation reaction consumes
200–350 SCFB/wt% change (34–59 Nm3/m3/wt% change). Typically, the heat re-
leased in pre-treating is about 0.02◦F/SCFB H 2consumed (0.002◦C/Nm3/m3H2).DISTILLATE HYDROCRACKING 293

Figure 7.6. Postulated mechanism for hydrodesulfurization.
The postulated mechanism for the desulfurization reaction is shown in Figure 7.6: ﬁrst,
the sulfur is removed followed by the saturation of the intermediate oleﬁn compound.In the example below the thiophene is converted to butene as an intermediate whichis then saturated into butane.
Listed below in Figure 7.7 are several desulfurization reactions arranged in increasing
order of difﬁculty.
The denitrogenation reaction proceeds through a different path. In the postulated
mechanism for hydrodenitrogenation the aromatic hydrogenation occurs ﬁrst, fol-lowed by hydrogenolysis and, ﬁnally denitrogenation. This is shown in Figure 7.8.
Figure 7.9 shows a few typical examples of denitrogenation reactions.
Cracking reactions
Hydrocracking reactions proceed through a bifunctional mechanism. A bifunctional
mechanism is one that requires two distinct types of catalytic sites to catalyze sepa-rate steps in the reaction sequence. These two functions are the acid function, whichprovide for the cracking and isomerization and the metal function, which provide forthe oleﬁn formation and hydrogenation. The cracking reaction requires heat while

the hydrogenation reaction generates heat. Overall, there is heat release in hydroc-
racking, and just like in treating, it is a function of the hydrogen consumption (thehigher the consumption, the greater the exotherm). Generally, the hydrogen consump-tion in hydrocracking (including the pre-treating section) is 1200–2400 SCFB/wt%change (200–420 Nm
3/m3/wt% change) resulting in a typical heat release of 50–
100 Btu/SCF H 2(2.1–4.2 kcal/m3H2) which translates into a temperature increase
of about 0.065◦F/SCF H 2consumed (0.006◦C/Nm3/m3H2). This includes the heat
release generated in the treating section.
In general, the hydrocracking reaction starts with the generation of an oleﬁn or cy-
cleoleﬁn on a metal site on the catalyst. Next, an acid site adds a proton to the oleﬁnor cyclooleﬁn to produce a carbenium ion. The carbenium ion cracks to a smaller

carbenium ion and a smaller oleﬁn. These products are the primary hydrocracking"
"products. These primary products can react further to produce still smaller secondaryhydrocracking products. The reaction sequence can be terminated at primary prod-ucts by abstracting a proton from the carbenium ion to form an oleﬁn at an acid siteand by saturating the oleﬁn at a metal site. Figure 7.10 illustrates the speciﬁc stepsinvolved in the hydrocracking of parafﬁns. The reaction begins with the generationof an oleﬁn and the conversion of the oleﬁn to a carbenium ion. The carbenium iontypically isomerizes to form a more stable tertiary carbenium ion. Next, the crackingreaction occurs at a bond that is βto the carbenium ion charge. The βposition is the
second bond from the ionic charge. Carbenium ions can react with oleﬁns to transfercharge from one fragment to the other. In this way, charge can be transferred from asmaller hydrocarbon fragment to a larger fragment that can better accommodate thecharge. Finally, oleﬁn hydrogenation completes the mechanism. The hydrocrackingmechanism is selective for cracking of higher carbon number parafﬁns. This selectiv-ity is due in part to a more favorable equilibrium for the formation of higher carbonnumber oleﬁns. In addition, large parafﬁns adsorb more strongly. The carbenium ionintermediate causes extensive isomerization of the products, especially to α-methyl
isomers, because tertiary carbenium ions are more stable. Finally, the production ofC
1to C 3is low because the production of these light gases involves the unfavorable
formation of primary and secondary carbenium ions. Other molecular species suchas alkyl naphthenes, alkyl aromatics, and so on react via similar mechanisms e.g., viathe carbenium ion mechanism.
In summary, hydrocracking occurs as the result of a bifunctional mechanism that
involves oleﬁn dehydrogenation–hydrogenation reactions on a metal site, carbenium296 CHAPTER 7

ion formation on an acid site, and isomerization, and cracking of the carbenium ion.
The hydrocracking reactions tend to favor conversion of large molecules because theequilibrium for oleﬁn formation is more favorable for large molecules and becausethe relative strength of adsorption is greater for large molecules. In hydrocracking,the products are highly isomerized, C
1and C 3formation is low, and single rings are
relatively stable.
In addition to treating and hydrocracking several other important reactions take place
in hydrocrackers. These are aromatic saturation, polynuclear aromatics (PNA) forma-tion and coke formation. Some aromatic saturation occurs in the treating section andsome in the cracking section. Aromatic saturation is the only reaction in hydrocrack-ing which is equilibrium limited at the higher temperatures reached by hydrocrackerstoward the end of the catalyst cycle life. Because of this equilibrium limitation, com-plete aromatic saturation is not possible toward the end of the catalyst cycle whenreactor temperature has to be increased to make up for the loss in catalyst activityresulting from coke formation and deposition. Table 7.2 shows the thermodynamicsof the major reactions taking place in a hydrocracker. Of course, the principles of ther-modynamics provide the means to determine which reactions are possible. In general,the thermodynamic equilibrium for hydrocracking is favorable. Cracking reactions,desulfurization and denitrogenation are favored at the typical hydrocracker operatingconditions. The initial step in the hydrocracking of parafﬁns or naphthenes is the gen-eration of an oleﬁn or cyclooleﬁn. This step is unfavorable under the high hydrogenpartial pressure used in hydrocracking. The dehydrogenation of the smaller alkanesis most unfavorable. Nevertheless, the concentration of oleﬁns and cyclooleﬁns issufﬁciently high, and the conversion of these intermediates to carbenium ions is suf-ﬁciently fast so that the overall hydrocracking rate is not limited by the equilibriumoleﬁn levels (Table 7.2).
Polynuclear aromatics (PNA), sometimes called polycyclic aromatics (PCA), or pol-
yaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are compounds containing at least two benzene ringsin the molecule. Normally, the feed to a hydrocracker can contain PNA with up toseven benzene rings in the molecule. PNA formation is an important, though undesir-able, reaction that occurs in hydrocrackers. Figure 7.11 shows the competing pathwaysfor conversion of multiring aromatics. One pathway starts with metal-catalyzed ringDISTILLATE HYDROCRACKING 297

saturation and continues with acid-catalyzed cracking reactions. The other pathway"
"begins with an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction to form a large aromatic-ringcompound. This molecule may undergo subsequent condensation reactions to form alarge PNA.
The consequence of operating hydrocracking units with recycle of the unconverted
feed is creation of PNA with more than seven benzene rings in the molecule. Theseare called heavy polynuclear aromatics (HPNA) whose formation is shown in Figure7.12. The HPNA produced on the catalyst may exit the reactor and cause downstreamfouling; or they may deposit on the catalyst and form coke, which deactivates thecatalyst. Their presence results in plugging of equipment. For mitigation a streamof 5 to as much as 10% of unconverted material might have to be taken out of thehydrocracker, resulting in much lower than expected conversion of the feed.

Catalysts
Hydrocracking catalysts are dual function catalysts. For the cracking reaction to oc-
cur (as well as some of the other reactions taking place in hydrocracking, such ashydroisomerization and dehydrocyclization), both metallic sites and acidic sites mustbe present on the catalyst surface. Hydrocracking catalysts have a cracking functionand hydrogenation function. The cracking function is provided by an acidic support,whereas the hydrogenation function is provided by metals.
The acidic support consists of amorphous oxides (e.g., silica-alumina, a crystalline
zeolite (mostly modiﬁed Y zeolite)) plus binder (e.g., alumina), or a mixture of crys-talline zeolite and amorphous oxides. Cracking and isomerization reactions take placeon the acidic support. The metals providing the hydrogenation function can be noblemetals (palladium, platinum), or non-noble (also called “base”) metal sulﬁdes fromgroup VIA (molybdenum, tungsten) and group VIIIA (cobalt, nickel). These metalscatalyze the hydrogenation of the feedstock, making it more reactive for crackingand heteroatom removal, as well as reducing the coking rate. They also initiate thecracking by forming a reactive oleﬁn intermediate via dehydrogenation.
The ratio between the catalyst’ s cracking function and hydrogenation function can
be adjusted in order to optimize activity and selectivity. Activity and selectivity arebut two of the four key performance criteria by which hydrocracking catalysts aremeasured:
rInitial activity, which is measured by the temperature required to obtain desiredproduct at the start of the run.
rStability, which is measured by the rate of increase of temperature required tomaintain conversion.
rProduct selectivity, which is a measure of the ability of a catalyst to produce thedesired product slate.
rProduct quality, which is a measure of the ability of the process to produce productswith the desired use speciﬁcations, such as pour point, smoke point, or cetanenumber.
For a hydrocracking catalyst to be effective, it is important that there be a rapidmolecular transfer between the acid sites and hydrogenation sites in order to avoidundesirable secondary reactions. Rapid molecular transfer can be achieved by havingthe hydrogenation sites located in the proximity of the cracking (acid) sites.
Acid function of the catalystA solid oxide support material supplies the acid function of the hydrocracking catalyst.
Amorphous silica-alumina provides the cracking function of amorphous catalysts andserves as support for the hydrogenation metals. Amorphous silica-alumina catalystsDISTILLATE HYDROCRACKING 299

are commonly used in distillate producing hydrocracking catalysts. Amorphous silica-
alumina also plays a catalytic role in low-zeolite hydrocracking catalysts. In high-zeolite hydrocracking catalysts it acts primarily a support for metals and as binder.Zeolites, particularly Y zeolite, are commonly used in high activity distillate catalystsand in naphtha catalysts. Other acidic support components such as acid-treated clays,pillared clays, layered silicates, acid metal phosphates, and other solid acids have beentried in the past, however, present day hydrocracking catalysts do not contain any ofthese materials.
Amorphous mixed metal oxide supports are acidic because of the difference in charge
between adjacent cations in the oxide structure. The advantages of amorphous silica-alumina for hydrocracking are that it has large pores, which permit access of bulky feedstock molecules to the acidic sites, and moderate activity, which makes the metal-acidbalance needed for distillate selectivity easier to obtain. Figure 7.13 is an illustrationof silica-alumina acid sites. The substitution of an Al
+
3cation for a Si+4cation leaves
a net negative charge on the framework that can be balanced by an acidic proton. The"
"removal of water from this Bronsted acid site creates a Lewis acid site. A Bronstedacid site on a catalyst is an acid site where the acidic entity is an ionizable hydrogen.A Lewis acid site on a catalyst is an acid site where the acidic entity is a positiveion such as Al
+
3rather than an ionizable hydrogen. Although plausible hydrocracking
mechanisms can be written for both Bronsted or Lewis sites, Bronsted acidity is
believed to be more desirable because Lewis acid sites may catalyze coke formation.
Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates composed of Al 2O3and SiO 2tetrahedral units
that form a negatively charged microporous framework structure enclosing cavities
occupied by large ions and water molecules, both of which have considerable freedomof movement, permitting ion-exchange, and reversible dehydration. Mobile cations,which are not part of the framework but are part of the zeolites, are readily exchanged.If the mobile cations are exchanged with NH
+
4, followed by calcination to remove
NH 3, a Bronsted acid site is formed. The zeolite used in hydrocracking, Y zeolite, is
synthetic. It has a structure nearly identical to the naturally found zeolite faujasite. The
Y zeolite has both a relatively large free aperture, which controls access of reactantsto acid sites, and a three-dimensional pore structure, which allows diffusion of the300 CHAPTER 7
reactants in and products out with minimal interference. Both Bronsted and Lewis
acids are possible in zeolites. The number of acid sites and the strength of the acidsites may be varied. These sites are highly uniform, but each zeolite may have morethan one type of site. The following factors inﬂuence the number and strength ofacid sites in zeolites: the types of cations occupying the ion exchange sites, thermaltreatments that the sample has received, and the ratio of silica to alumina of theframework. For example, Y zeolite can be dealuminated by a variety of methods,including thermal and hydrothermal treatments. Dealumination decreases the totalnumber of acid sites because each proton is associated with a framework aluminum.However, dealumination also increases the strength of the acid sites to a certain point.As a result, the total acidity of the zeolite, which is a product of the number of sitesand strength per site, peaks at an intermediate extent of dealumination. Clearly, theacid site concentration and strength of zeolites affect the ﬁnal hydrocracking catalystproperties. The principal advantage of zeolites for hydrocracking is their high acidity.
Metal function of the catalystA metal, a metal oxide, a metal sulﬁde, or a combination of these compounds may
supply the metal function of the catalyst. The key requirement for the metal functionis that it must activate hydrogen and catalyze dehydrogenation and hydrogenationreactions. In addition, metal-catalyzed hydrogenolysis (carbon–carbon breaking) isundesirable because the distribution of the hydrogenolysis products is less desirablerelative to hydrocracking.
The most commonly used metal function for hydrocracking catalysts is a combination
of Group VIA (Mo, W) and Group VIIIA (Co, Ni) metal sulﬁdes. The major advantageof this combination of metal sulﬁdes is that it is sulfur tolerant; however, it has onlymoderate activity compared to Pd or Pt. The combination of Group VIA and GroupVIIIA metal sulﬁdes has been extensively characterized because of its importance tohydrocracking. Although Group VIIIA metal sulﬁdes have some hydrogenation activ-ity, these sulﬁdes alone are much less active than the Group VIA metal sulﬁdes and areconsidered to be promoters. The Group VIIIA metal promoter interacts synergisticallywith the Group VIA metal sulﬁde to produce a substantial increase in activity.
Because the Group VIA and Group VIIIA metals are most conveniently prepared
as oxides, a sulﬁding step is necessary. That will be discussed in section “CatalystLoading and Activation”.
Catalyst manufacturing
Hydrocracking catalysts can be manufactured by a variety of methods. The method
chosen usually represents a balance between manufacturing cost and the degree toDISTILLATE HYDROCRACKING 301
which the desired chemical and physical properties are achieved. Although there
is a relationship between catalyst formulation, preparation procedure, and catalystproperties, the details of that relationship are not always well understood due to thecomplex nature of the catalyst systems. The chemical composition of the catalystplays a decisive role in its performance; the physical and mechanical properties alsoplay a major role.
The preparation of hydrocracking catalysts involves several steps:
rPrecipitation
rFiltration (decantation, centrifugation)
rWashing
rDrying
rForming
rCalcination
rImpregnation
Other steps, such as kneading or mulling, grinding, and sieving, may also be required."
"Depending on the preparation method used, some of these steps may be eliminated,whereas other steps may be added. For example, kneading or comulling of the wetsolid precursors is used in some processes instead of precipitation. When the metalprecursors are precipitated or comulled together with the support precursors, theimpregnation step can be eliminated. Described below are the steps that are an integralpart of any hydrocracking catalyst manufacturing process.
Precipitation
Precipitation involves the mixing of solutions or suspension of materials, resulting
in the formation of a precipitate, which may be crystalline or amorphous. Mullingor kneading of wet solid materials usually leads to the formation of a paste thatis subsequently formed and dried. The mulled or kneaded product is submitted tothermal treatment in order to obtain a more intimate contact between components andbetter homogeneity by thermal diffusion and solid-state reactions. Precipitation ormulling is often used to prepare the support for the catalyst and the metal componentis subsequently added by impregnation.
The support determines the mechanical properties of the catalyst, such as attrition
resistance, hardness, and crushing strength. High surface area and proper pore sizedistribution is generally required. The pore size distribution and other physical proper-ties of a catalyst support prepared by precipitation are also affected by the precipitationand the aging conditions of the precipitate as well as by subsequent drying, forming,and calcining.302 CHAPTER 7

Forming
The ﬁnal shape and size of catalyst particles is determined in the forming step. Cat-
alysts and catalyst supports are formed into several possible shapes such as spheres,cylindrical extrudates, or shaped forms such as trilobes or quadrilobes. Spherical cat-alyst support catalyst is obtained by ‘oil dropping’ whereby precipitation occurs uponthe pouring of a liquid into a second immiscible liquid. Spherical bead catalyst areobtained by this process which is shown in Figure 7.14.
Generally, because of cost considerations, the majority of catalysts are currently
formed in shapes other than spheres. Only amorphous silica-alumina catalysts areformed as spheres.
Extrudates are obtained by extruding a thick paste through a die with perforations.
Peptizing agents are usually included in the paste. The spaghetti-like extrudate isusually dried and then broken into short pieces. The typical length to diameter ratioof the extrudates varies between 2 and 4. The extrudate is then dried and/or calcined.The water content of the paste submitted to extrusion is critical because it determinesthe density, pore size distribution, and mechanical strength of the catalyst. The watercontent of the paste is usually kept close to the minimum at which extrusion is stillpossible. Figure 7.15 shows a typical extrudate support manufacturing.
The form of extrudates may vary. The simplest form is cylindrical, but other forms such
as trilobes, twisted trilobes, or quadrilobes, are also found commercially. CatalystsDISTILLATE HYDROCRACKING 303

(including the metal components), only drying may be required prior to forming,
with subsequent calcination of the formed product. Thermal treatment of the catalystor support eliminates water and other volatile matter. The drying and calcinationconditions are of critical importance in determining the physical as well as catalyticproperties of the product. Surface area, pore size distribution, stability, attrition re-sistance, crushing strength, as well as the catalytic activity are affected by the dryingand calcination conditions.
Impregnation"
"Impregnation is used to incorporate a metal component into a preformed catalyst
support. Several impregnation methods may be used for catalyst preparation: (a)impregnation by immersion (dipping), (b) impregnation by incipient wetness, and(c) diffusional impregnation. In the ﬁrst method, which is the most commonly used,the calcined support is immersed in an excess of solution containing the metal com-pound. The solution ﬁlls the pores and is also adsorbed on the support surface. Theexcess volume is drained off. Impregnation to incipient wetness is carried out by tum-bling or spraying the activated support with a volume of solution having the properconcentration of metal compound, and equal to or slightly less than the pore volumeof the support. The impregnated support is dried and calcined. Because metal oxidesare formed in the process, the calcination step is also called oxidation. In diffusionalimpregnation the support is saturated with water or with acid solution, and immersedinto the acqueous solution containing the metal compound. That compound subse-quently diffuses into the pores of the support through the aqueous phase. Figure 7.17shows an example of catalyst ﬁnishing (impregnation).DISTILLATE HYDROCRACKING 305
Catalyst loading and activation
Catalyst loadingThere are two methods of catalyst loading sock loading and dense loading. Sock
loading is done by pouring catalyst into a hopper mounted on top of the reactor andthen allowing it to ﬂow through a canvas sock into the reactor. Dense loading ordense bed packing is done with the help of a mechanical device. The dense loadingmethod was introduced in the mid-1970s. Catalyst loaded by sock loading will havea higher void fraction than catalyst that was dense loaded. Dense bed packing and theresulting higher-pressure drop provides a more even distribution of liquid in a trickleﬂow reactor which is the ﬂow regime for most hydrocracker applications. If diffusionlimitations are negligible, dense loading is desirable in order to maximize the reactionrate per unit reactor volume. This is often the case in hydrocracking reactors. The otheradvantage of dense loading is that it orients the catalyst particles in a horizontal anduniform manner. This improves the vapor/liquid distribution through the catalyst beds.Catalyst particle orientation is important especially for cylindrically shaped extrudedcatalyst in vapor/liquid reactant systems. When the catalyst particles are oriented in ahorizontal position in the catalyst bed, liquid maldistribution or channeling is almostcompletely eliminated. This maldistribution tends to occur when the catalyst loading isdone by the sock loading method, which generally causes the extrudates to be orientedin a downward slant toward the reactor walls increasing bed voids and creating liquidmaldistribution. Of all the factors inﬂuencing catalyst utilization, catalyst loading hasgenerally proven to be the most important factor. Except for the hydrocrackers thathave reactor pressure drop limitations mainly due to operation at higher than designthroughputs, the great majority of units worldwide are dense loaded.
Catalyst activationHydrocracking catalysts have to be activated in order to be catalytically active. Several
names are used for that purpose, such as sulﬁding, presulﬁding, presulfurizing inaddition to activation. The metals on the greatest majority of catalysts are in an oxideform at the completion of the manufacturing process. The noble metal catalysts areactivated by hydrogen reduction of the ﬁnished catalyst, in which the metal is alsoin an oxide form. Calcination in air prior to reduction is necessary to avoid metalsintering. The presence of water vapors is generally avoided, also to prevent metalsintering. By using an excess of hydrogen, the water formed during reduction can beswept away. The activation of noble metal catalysts by hydrogen reduction occurs at570–750
◦F (300–400◦C).
The non-noble (base metal) catalysts are activated by transforming the catalyticallyinactive metal oxides into active metal sulﬁdes (thus the name sulﬁding, etc.). Thisis accomplished mainly in-situ though some reﬁners have started to do the activation306 CHAPTER 7
outside the unit (ex-situ). It is likely more and more reﬁners will opt to receive
the catalyst at the reﬁnery site in pre-sulﬁded state to accelerate the start up of theunit. In-situ sulﬁding can be accomplished either in vapor or liquid phase. In vaporphase sulﬁding, the activation of the catalyst is accomplished by injecting a chem-ical which easily decomposes to H
2S, such as di-methyl-di-sulphide (DMDS) or
di-methyl-sulﬁde (DMS); use of H 2S was fairly common until a few years ago, but"
"now it is only rarely used because of environmental and safety concerns. Liquid phasesulﬁding can be accomplished with or without spiked feedstocks. In the latter case,the feedstock is generally a gas oil type material that contains sulfur compounds inranges from a few thousand to twenty thousand ppm. The H
2S necessary for the ac-
tivation of the catalyst is generated by the decomposition of the sulfur compounds.This method is in very little use today, but it was ‘state-of-the-art’ in the 1960s andearly 1970s. The preferred sulﬁding procedure in the industry is liquid phase witha spiking agent (generally DMDS or DMS). It results in important savings of timewhen compared to either vapor phase or liquid phase without spiking agents. An-other advantage of liquid phase over gas phase sulﬁding is that by having all thecatalyst particles wet from the very beginning there is very little chance of catalystbed channeling which can occur if the catalyst particles are allowed to dry out. Thein-situ sulﬁding occurs at temperatures between 450 and 600
◦F (230–315◦C) regard-
less of the method used. Some catalyst manufacturers recommend the sulﬁding beconducted at full operating pressure while others prefer it be done at pressures lowerthan the normal operating pressure. Ammonia injection is practiced during the sul-ﬁding of high activity (high zeolite content) catalysts to prevent premature catalystdeactivation.
In the case of ex-situ presulfurization of catalyst, sulfur compounds are loaded onto
the catalyst. The activation occurs when the catalyst, which has been loaded in thereactor, is heated up in the presence of hydrogen. The activation can be conductedeither in vapor or liquid phase. Generally, activation of ex-situ presulfurized catalyst isaccomplished faster than if the sulﬁding is done in-situ, however there is the additionalexpense due to the need for the ex-situ presulfurization step.
The economics vary from reﬁner to reﬁner, however ex-situ presulfurization is rarely
used for hydrocracking catalysts.
Catalyst deactivation and regeneration
Catalyst deactivation is the gradual loss of the catalyst’ s ability to convert the feed
into useful products. Catalyst activity is a measure of the relative rate of feedstockconversion. In practical terms it is the temperature required to obtain a ﬁxed conver-sion. As the run progresses, the catalyst loses activity. Catalyst will lose activity inseveral ways described below.DISTILLATE HYDROCRACKING 307
Coke deposition
Coke deposition is a byproduct of the cracking reactions. The laydown of coke on a
catalyst is a time–temperature phenomenon in that the longer the exposure and/or thehigher the temperature the catalyst is subjected to, the more severe the deactivatingeffect. It begins with adsorption of high-molecular weight, low hydrogen/carbon ratioring compounds; it proceeds with further loss of hydrogen content, and ends withvarying degrees of hardness of coke. This coke can cover active sites and/or preventaccess to these sites by physical blockage of the entrance to the pores leading to thesites. Coke is not a permanent poison. Catalyst, which has been deactivated by cokedeposition, can be, relatively easily, restored to near original condition by regeneration.
Reversible poisoning
Catalyst poisoning is primarily the result of strong chemisorption of impurities on
active sites. This type of poisoning is reversible—that is, when the deactivating agentis removed, the deactivating effect is gradually reversed. In some cases, raising thecatalyst temperature can compensate for the deactivating effect. But, raising tempera-tures will, however, increase the rate of coke deposition. One example of a reversiblepoison is carbon monoxide, which can impair the hydrogenation reactions by prefer-ential adsorption on active sites. Another example is H
2S, which in moderate to high
concentrations can reduce the desulfurization, rate constant. In this case, the removalof H
2S from the recycle gas system solves the problem.
Agglomeration of the hydrogenation component
Another reversible form of catalyst deactivation is the agglomeration of the hydro-
genation component of the catalyst. It can be caused by poor catalyst activation condi-tions in which a combination of high water partial pressure and high temperature mayexist for a prolonged period. Regeneration can restore the catalyst to near originalcondition.
Metals deposition
Deposition of metals is not reversible, even with catalyst regeneration. The metals"
"may come into the system via additives, such as silicon compounds used in cokedrums to reduce foaming, or feedstock contaminants such as Pb, Fe, As, P , Na, Ca,Mg, or as organo-metallic compounds in the feed primarily containing Ni and V . Thedeposition of Ni and V takes place at the pore entrances or near the outer surface ofthe catalyst, creating a ‘rind’ layer—effectively choking off access to the interior partof the catalyst, where most of the surface area resides. Metals deposition can damagethe acid sites, the metal sites, or both.308 CHAPTER 7
Catalyst support sintering
This is another reason for loss of catalyst activity and it also is irreversible. This
is also a result of high temperatures and particularly in connection with high waterpartial pressures. In this case the catalyst support material can lose surface area froma collapse of pores, or from an increase in the diameter of pores, with the pore volumeremaining approximately constant.
Catalyst regenerationA coked catalyst is usually regenerated by combustion in a stream of diluted oxygen
or air, although steam or steam–air mixtures have also been used in the past. Uponcombustion, coke is converted to CO
2and H 2O. In the absence of excess oxygen, CO
may also form. Except for the noble metal catalysts, hydrocracking catalysts containsulfur, as the metals are in a sulﬁde form. In the regeneration process, the sulfur willbe emitted as SO
2. In general, sulfur oxide emission starts at lower temperature than
CO 2emission. Regeneration of commercial catalysts can be done in-situ or ex-situ.
The majority of commercial catalysts regeneration is performed ex-situ because ofenvironmental considerations as well as because it results in a better performing cata-lyst. There are several companies that perform ex-situ regeneration by using differentequipment for burning off the coke. One company uses a continuous rotolouver, whichis a cylindrical drum rotating slowly on a horizontal axis and enclosing a series ofoverlapping louvers. The spent catalyst passes slowly through the rotolouver, whereit encounters a countercurrent of hot air. Another company uses a porous movingbelt as a regenerator. The catalyst is moved with the stainless steel belt through astationary tunnel furnace vessel where the regeneration takes place. A third com-pany regenerator uses ebullated bed technology to perform the catalyst regeneration.Regardless of the process, the spent catalyst is submitted to de-oiling prior to regen-eration. This is to eliminate as much hydrocarbon as possible as well as to remove asmuch sulfur as possible to prevent formation of sulfates which could deposit on thecatalyst and not be removed during regeneration. Sulfates are deleterious to catalystperformance.
Design and operation of hydrocracking reactors
Design and construction of hydrocracking reactorsHydrocracking reactors are downﬂow, ﬁxed-bed catalytic reactors, generally operating
in trickle ﬂow regime. Because hydrocracking occurs at high pressure and relativelyhigh temperature and in the presence of hydrogen and hydrogen sulﬁde the reactorsare vessels with thick wall constructed from special materials. The reactors are usuallycylindrical vessels fabricated from 2

austenitic stainless steel weld overlay or liner, for added corrosion protection. More
specialized materials, in which a small amount of vanadium is added to the 21/4
Cr–1 Mo or 3 Cr–1 Mo reactor base metal to increase its strength characteristics,started being used by some fabricators in the last few years. A typical drawing of ahydrocracking reactor is shown in Figure 7.18.
The size of the hydrocracking reactors varies widely depending on the design condi-
tions and is dependent on the desired mass velocity and acceptable pressure drops.Commercially, reactors with inside diameters of up to 16 ft (4.9 m) have been fab-ricated. Depending on the design pressure and inside diameter, the thickness of thereactor walls can be as much as 1 ft (30 cm). Since heat release is a common fea-ture for all hydrocrackers, reactor temperature control has to be exercised. As shownschematically in Figure 7.18, a hydrocracking reactor will contain several separatecatalyst beds. The number of catalytic beds in a reactor and their respective lengths aredetermined from the design temperature rise proﬁle. The maximum acceptable tem-perature rise per bed deﬁnes the length of the catalyst bed. The acceptable temperaturemaximum, in turn, depends on the operating mode of the hydrocracker. For exam-ple, operations designed to maximize naphtha have a different maximum from thosedesigned the production of middle distillate. A typical reactor operated to maximize310 CHAPTER 7
naphtha yields will have as many as ﬁve or six beds. A typical reactor operated to pro-"
"duce middle distillate will have three or four beds. Commercial catalyst beds can reachlengths up to 20 ft (6 m). A typical pre-treating reactor will have two or three beds ifthe feed is straight run material, and up to ﬁve beds if the feed contains appreciableamounts of cracked material. Cold hydrogen gas, introduced in the quench zones, isused for reactor temperature control. The quench zones separating successive catalystbeds have the following functions: (a) to cool the partially reacted ﬂuids with hydro-gen quench gas; (b) to assure a uniform temperature distribution the ﬂuids enteringthe next catalyst bed; and (c) to mix efﬁciently and disperse evenly the ﬂuids overthe top of the next catalyst bed. Since hydrocracking is an exothermic process, theﬂuids exiting one catalyst bed have to be cooled prior to entering the next catalystbed, in order to avoid overheating and to provide a safe and stable operation. This isaccomplished by thorough mixing with cool hydrogen. Furthermore, the temperaturedistribution in the cooled ﬂuids entering the next catalyst bed has to be uniform inorder to minimize the radial temperature gradients in successive catalyst beds. Un-balanced temperatures in a catalyst bed may result in different reaction rates in thesame bed. This can lead to different deactivation rates of the catalyst, and, in worsecases, to temperature excursions. In addition to a uniform temperature distribution, itis also important to achieve a good mass ﬂow distribution. The effective vapor/liquidmixing and uniform distribution of ﬂuids over the top of the catalyst bed, accom-plished in the quench zone, reestablishes an even mass ﬂow distribution through thebed. There is a multitude of companies providing vapor/liquid distribution devices,from process licensors, to catalyst manufacturers and, engineering contractors. Mostdistribution devices perform well, provided they are properly installed. Another im-portant parameter is liquid ﬂux (lbs/hr/sqft of cross-sectional area). While gas massﬂux has practically no inﬂuence on liquid distribution, liquid mass ﬂux is determinantin avoiding mal distribution in the catalyst bed. Operation at a liquid mass ﬂux ofmore than 2,000 lbs/hr/sqft is recommended; operation at liquid ﬂuxes lower than1,500 lbs/hr/sqft is discouraged. Furthermore, it should be noticed that if the liquidmass ﬂux is below the recommended limit, increasing the gas mass ﬂux will havevery little effect, if any, on the liquid distribution (e.g., it will not improve it).
Hydrocracking reactor operationDuring operation, the hydrocracking catalyst gradually loses some of its activity. In
order to maintain the conversion of feedstock to products constant, the average bedtemperature is gradually increased. The temperature increase in many cases is verysmall, less than 2
◦F/month (1◦C/month). When the average bed temperature reaches
a value close to the design maximum, the catalyst has to be replaced or reactivated.Because the required temperature increase per unit time is relatively small, the reactorcan be operated with the same catalyst for several years before replacement of thedeactivated catalyst becomes necessary. Similar changes take place in the pre-treatingreactor.DISTILLATE HYDROCRACKING 311
Kinetics is the study of the rates of reaction. The rates of reaction determine the
key properties of a hydrocracking catalyst: initial activity, selectivity, stability, andproduct quality. The temperature required to obtain the desired product at the startof the run measures the initial activity. In general, the catalyst activity is a measureof the relative rate of feedstock conversion. In hydrocracking, activity is deﬁned asthe temperature required to obtain ﬁxed conversion under certain process conditions.Hydrocracking conversion is usually deﬁned in terms of change of endpoint:
% Conversion =/parenleftbig/parenleftbig
EP
+
feed−EP+product/parenrightbig
/EP+feed/parenrightbig
×100
where EP+indicates the fraction of material in the feed or product boiling above the
desired endpoint.
Catalyst selectivity is a measure of the rate of formation of a desired product relative
to the rate of conversion of the feed (or formation of other products). Hydrocrackingselectivity is expressed as the yield of desired product at a speciﬁc conversion. Yield isdetermined by the rate of formation of the desired product relative to the feed rate. At100% conversion, catalyst yield equals catalyst selectivity. Hydrocracking selectivityis affected by operating conditions. In general, more severe operating conditions causehigher selectivity to secondary products.
Catalyst stability is a measure of change of reaction rate over time. Hydrocrackers"
"are typically operated in the constant conversion mode, with temperature adjustmentsmade to maintain the desired conversion. Hydrocracking activity stability is deﬁned asthe temperature change required to maintain constant conversion. Changes in productyield over time on-stream occur when using zeolitic catalysts. Hydrocracking yieldstability is deﬁned as the yield change with time at constant conversion and is usuallyexpressed as a function of temperature change.
The product quality is a measure of the ability of the process to yield products with
the desired use speciﬁcation such as pour point, smoke point or octane. Table 7.3shows some of the important product quality measurements and the chemical basisfor these measurements.
Table 7.3. Chemical basis for product quality

Low pour point Low concentration of n-parafﬁns
Low freeze point Low concentration of n-parafﬁns
Low cloud point Low concentration of n-parafﬁns

High octane High ratio of i/n-parafﬁns
High concentration of aromaticsHigh concentration of naphthenes312 CHAPTER 7
Hydrocracking process variables
The proper operation of the unit will depend on the careful selection and control of
the processing conditions. By careful monitoring of these process variables the unitcan operate to its full potential.
Catalyst temperatureThe amount of conversion which takes place in the reactors is going to be determined
by several variables: the type of feedstock, the amount of time the feed is in thepresence of catalyst, the partial pressure of hydrogen in the catalyst bed, and, mostimportantly, the temperature of the catalyst and reactants. The obvious generalizationabout temperature is that the higher the temperature, the faster the rate of reaction andtherefore, the higher the conversion. Since hydrocracking is exothermic, overall, thetemperature increases as the feed and recycle gas proceed through the catalyst beds.It is very important that the temperature increase (/Delta1 T) be controlled carefully at all
times. It is possible to generate more heat from the reactions than the ﬂowing streamscan remove from the reactors. If this happens, the temperature may increase veryrapidly. This condition is called a temperature excursion or a temperature runaway. Atemperature runaway is a very serious situation since extremely high temperatures canbe generated within a short period of time. These high temperatures can cause damageto the catalyst and/or to the reactors. To avoid these situations, temperature guidelineshave to be observed. These guidelines are dependent on the type of feedstock, andthe type of catalyst, and vary from catalyst supplier to catalyst supplier, but by andlarge, limit the temperature rise of catalyst beds loaded with noble metal catalyst toabout 30
◦F (17◦C). The temperature rise of catalyst beds loaded with high activity
base metal catalysts (for naphtha production) is limited to about 40◦F (22◦C) and
those loaded with low zeolite content catalyst (for middle distillate production) thetemperature rise is limited to 50
◦F (28◦C). Finally, maximum bed temperature rises of
about 75◦F (42◦C) are recommended for amorphous catalysts. The same maximum
bed temperature rise is also recommended for most pre-treating reactors. To properlymonitor the reactions as the reactants pass through the catalyst bed, it is not sufﬁcientto just measure the temperature of the ﬂowing stream at the inlet and outlet of eachbed and/or the reactor. It is necessary to observe the temperature at the inlet, outlet,and radially throughout the catalyst bed. A temperature proﬁle plot is a useful tool forevaluating performance of catalyst, effectiveness of quench, and reactor ﬂow patterns.A temperature proﬁle can be constructed by plotting the catalyst temperature versusdistance into the catalyst bed (or more accurately vs. weight percent of catalyst). Thehydrocracking reactor should be operated with equal catalyst peak temperatures. Inthis manner the total catalyst volume is utilized during the entire cycle. The weightaverage bed temperature (WABT) is typically used to compare the catalyst activ-ity. Figure 7.19 gives a general description of how the WABT is calculated for areactor.DISTILLATE HYDROCRACKING 313

Figure 7.19. Example calculation of weight average reactor temperature (WABT).
The rate of increase of the reactor WABT to maintain both hydrotreating and hydro-
cracking functions, in order to obtain the desire conversion level and product quality,is referred to as the deactivation rate. It is one of the key variables used to monitorthe performance of the catalyst systems. The deactivation rate can be expressed in
◦F
per barrel of feed processed per pound of catalyst (◦C per m3of feed per kilogram of
catalyst) or more simply stated as◦F per day (◦C per day). The decrease in catalyst"
"activity for hydrotreating catalyst will show up in a decrease in its ability to maintaina constant nitrogen level in the hydrotreating catalyst efﬂuent. For hydrocracking cat-alyst, a decrease in catalyst activity will generally show up in its ability to maintain314 CHAPTER 7
a constant conversion to the desired product slate. To hold the same conversion level
to the desired product slate the reactor WABT is gradually increased.
Conversion
The term “conversion” is usually deﬁned as:
Conversion, vol% =(Fresh Feed −((Fractionator Bottoms)/Fresh Feed))
×100
where:
FF=Fresh feed rate, BPD or m3/hr
Frac Bottoms =Net fractionator bottoms product to storage, BPD or m3/hr
Conversion is useful as a measure of the severity of the operation. It requires higher
severity (meaning higher catalyst temperature) to go to higher conversion levels andhigher severity to reduce the endpoint of the product at a constant conversion. Con-version is normally controlled by catalyst temperature.
Fresh feed quality
The quality of the raw oil charged to a hydrocracker will affect the temperature
required in the catalyst bed to reach the desired conversion, the amount of hydrogenconsumed in the process, the length of time before the catalyst is deactivated, and thequality of products. The effect of the feedstock quality on the performance of the unitis important and should be well understood, especially with regard to contaminantsthat can greatly reduce the life of the catalyst.
Sulfur and nitrogen compounds
In general, increasing the amount of organic nitrogen and sulfur compounds containedin the feed results in an increase in severity of the operation. The sulfur content ofthe feed for a normal vacuum gas oil charge stock can vary up to as high as 2.5–3.0wt%. The higher sulfur levels will cause a corresponding increase in the H
2S content
of the recycle gas that will normally have little or no effect on catalyst activity.
The organic nitrogen compounds are converted to ammonia which, if allowed to build
up in the recycle gas, competes with the hydrocarbon for the active catalyst sights.This results in a lower apparent activity of the catalyst as the ammonia concentrationincreases. Because of this, feedstocks with high organic nitrogen contents are moredifﬁcult to process and require higher catalyst temperatures.DISTILLATE HYDROCRACKING 315
Hydrogen content
The amount of unsaturated compounds (such as oleﬁns and aromatics) contained inthe feed will have an effect on the heat released during the reaction and on the totalhydrogen consumption on the unit. In general, for a given boiling range feedstock,a reduction in API gravity (increase in speciﬁc gravity) indicates an increase in theamount of unsaturated compounds and, therefore, higher heats of reaction and higherhydrogen consumption. Large amounts of unsaturated hydrocarbons can also cause aheat balance problem if the unit has not been designed to process that type of feed.
Boiling range
The typical charge stock to a Hydrocracker is a 700
◦F+(370◦C+) boiling range
HVGO. Increasing the boiling range usually makes the feed more difﬁcult to processwhich means higher catalyst temperatures and shorter catalyst life. This is especiallytrue if the feed quality is allowed to decrease signiﬁcantly due to entrainment ofcatalyst poisons in the feed. Higher endpoint feeds also usually have higher sulfurand nitrogen contents, which again make it more difﬁcult to process.
Cracked feed components
Cracked feedstocks derived from catalytic cracking or thermal cracking can also beprocessed in a Hydrocracker. These cracked components tend to have higher contam-inants such as sulfur, nitrogen, and particulates. They are also more refractory, withhigh aromatics content and PNA precursors. These compounds make cracked stocksharder to process to produce quality products.
Permanent catalyst poisons
Organo-metallic compounds contained in the feed will be decomposed and the metalswill be retained on the catalyst, thus decreasing its activity. Since metals are normallynot removable by oxidative regeneration, once metals have poisoned a catalyst, itsactivity cannot be restored. Therefore, metals content of the feedstock is a criticalvariable that must be carefully controlled. The particular metals which usually existin vacuum gas oil type feeds are naturally occurring nickel, vanadium, and arsenic aswell as some metals which are introduced by upstream processing or contaminationsuch as lead, sodium, silicon and phosphorous. Iron naphthenates are soluble in oiland will be a poison for the catalyst. Iron sulﬁde as corrosion product is normallynot considered a poison for the catalyst and is usually omitted when referring to totalmetals.
The tolerance of the catalyst to metals is difﬁcult to quantify and is somewhat depen-"
"dent upon the type of catalyst being employed and the severity of the operation, i.e.,the higher the severity, the lower will be the metals’ tolerance since any impairmentof activity will affect the ability to make the desired conversion. It is recommendedto keep the total metals in the feedstock as low as possible and certainly not higherthan 2 wt-ppm.316 CHAPTER 7
Fresh feed rate (LHSV)
The amount of catalyst loaded into the reactors is based upon the quantity and quality
of design feedstock and the desired conversion level. The variable that is normallyused to relate the amount of catalyst to the amount of feed is termed liquid hourlyspace velocity (LHSV). LHSV is the ratio of volumetric feed rate per hour to thecatalyst volume. Hydrocrackers are normally designed for a LHSV that depends onthe severity of the operation. Increasing the fresh feed rate with a constant catalystvolume increases the LHSV and a corresponding increase in catalyst temperature willbe required to maintain a constant conversion. The increased catalyst temperature willlead to a faster rate of coke formation and, therefore, reduce the catalyst life. If theLHSV is run signiﬁcantly higher than the design of the unit, the rate of catalystdeactivation may become unacceptable. LHSV can be deﬁned as:
LHSV hr
−1=Total Feed to Reactor Inlet, m3/hr
Total Catalyst V olume, m3
Liquid recycleMost hydrocrackers are designed to recycle unconverted feed from the product frac-tionator bottoms back to the reactors. This stream is normally material distilled abovethe heaviest fractionator side cut product. For a distillate producing hydrocracker, therecycle stream is normally a 600–700
◦F (315–370◦C) heavy diesel plus material.
The liquid recycle rate is normally adjusted as a ratio with fresh feed. This variableis called combined feed ratio (CFR), and is deﬁned as follows:
CFR=Fresh Feed Rate +Liquid Recycle Rate
Fresh Feed Rate
It can be seen that if the unit has no liquid recycle from the fractionator back to thereactors, the CFR is 1.0 and the unit is said to operate once-through, i.e., the freshfeed goes through the catalyst bed only once. If the amount of liquid recycle is equalto fresh feed, the CFR will be 2.0.
An important function of liquid recycle is to reduce the severity of the operation.
Considering conversion per pass that is deﬁned as follows:
Conversion per Pass =/parenleftbiggFeed Rate −Frac Bottoms Rate to Storage
Feed Rate +Liquid Recycle Rate/parenrightbigg
×100
It can be seen that if a unit were operating once-through (CFR =1.0), and 100%
of the feed were converted into products boiling below, i.e. 700◦F (370◦C), the
conversion per pass is 100% since the feed only makes one pass through the catalyst.At the other extreme, if a unit is designed at a CFR of 2.0 and 100% of the feedconverted into products, the conversion per pass is only 50%. In this way, it can beseen that as the CFR increases, the conversion per pass decreases. It is also seen thatDISTILLATE HYDROCRACKING 317
the catalyst temperature requirement is reduced as the CFR is increased (at a constant
fresh feed conversion level). Therefore, reducing the CFR below the design valuecan lead to higher catalyst temperatures and shorter catalyst cycle life. Increasingthe CFR above design can be helpful when operating at low fresh feed rates since itdoes not allow the total mass ﬂow through the catalyst bed to reach such a low valuethat poor distribution patterns are established.
Hydrogen partial pressureThe reactor section operating pressure is controlled by the pressure that is maintained
at the high-pressure separator. This pressure, multiplied by the hydrogen purity of therecycle gas, determines the partial pressure of hydrogen at the separator. The hydrogenpartial pressure required for the operation of the unit is chosen based on the type offeedstock to be processed and the amount of conversion desired.
The function of hydrogen is to promote the saturation of oleﬁns and aromatics and sat-
urate the cracked hydrocarbons. It is also necessary to prevent excessive condensationreactions from forming coke. For this reason, running the unit for extended periods oftime at lower than design partial pressure of hydrogen will result in increased catalystdeactivation rate and shorter time between regeneration.
Hydrogen partial pressure has an impact on the saturation of aromatics. A decrease
in system pressure or recycle gas purity has a sharp effect on the product aromaticcontent. This will be especially true for kerosene aromatic content, which will in turnaffect the kerosene product smoke point.
A reduction in operating pressure below its design will have a negative effect on the
activity of the catalyst and will accelerate catalyst deactivation due to increased cokeformation.
Operating at higher than design pressure may not be possible. There will be a practical"
"equipment limitation on most units that will not allow signiﬁcantly higher pressurethan design, such as the pressure rating of the heaters, exchangers, and vessels. Themajor control variable for hydrogen partial pressure is the recycle gas purity thatshould be monitored closely to assure it is always maintained above the minimumvalue. The hydrogen purity can be improved by increasing the hydrogen purity ofthe makeup hydrogen, venting gas off the high-pressure separator, or reducing thetemperature at the high-pressure separator.
Recycle gas rateIn addition to maintaining a prescribed partial pressure of hydrogen in the reactor
section, it is equally important to maintain the physical contact of the hydrogen withthe catalyst and hydrocarbon so that the hydrogen is available at the sites where the318 CHAPTER 7
reaction is taking place. This is accomplished by circulating the recycle gas throughout
the reactor circuit continuously with the recycle gas compressor. The amount of gasthat must be recycled is a design variable again set by the design severity of theoperation. The standard measure of the amount of gas required is the ratio of the gasbeing recycled to the rate fresh feed being charged to the catalyst.
As with hydrogen partial pressure, the recycle gas/feed ratio should be maintained at
the design ratio. The actual calculation for the gas-to-oil ratio, can be deﬁned as:
Gas-to-Oil Ratio =Total Circulating Gas to Reactor, Nm
3/hr
Total Feed to Reactor Inlet, m3/hr
=Nm3/m3Feed
As with hydrogen partial pressure, any reduction of the gas-to-oil ratio below thedesign minimum will have adverse effects on the catalyst life. During normal opera-tions and through out the cycle length, there will be a gradual increase in the reactorsection pressure drop. As the pressure drop increases, there will be a tendency for thegas-to-oil ratio to decrease. When the pressure drop through the system increases tothe point where the minimum gas-to-oil ratio cannot be kept, either the unit through-put will have to be decreased to bring the gas-to-oil ratio back above the minimum,or the unit shutdown for catalyst regeneration or replacement.
Gas-to-oil ratio recommendations vary between licensors and/or catalyst vendors but
in general the minimums recommended are as follows: (a) 4,000 SCFB (675 nm
3/m3)
for amorphous catalyst systems and 5,500 SCFB (925 nm3/m3) for zeolitic catalyst
systems.
Makeup hydrogen
The quality of the hydrogen-rich gas from the hydrogen plant is an important variable
in the performance of Hydrocrackers since it can affect the hydrogen partial pressureand recycle gas/feed ratio and thereby inﬂuence the catalyst stability (deactivationrate). The following guidelines should be used in operating the hydrogen plant toproduce acceptable feed gas to a hydrocracker.
Hydrogen purity
The purity of hydrogen in the makeup gas to a Hydrocracker will have a majorinﬂuence on the hydrogen partial pressure and recycle gas/feed ratio. Therefore, theminimum purity on the makeup gas should be set to provide the minimum recycle gaspurity allowed. If the hydrogen plant is unable for some reason to produce minimumhydrogen purity product, it may be possible to purge sufﬁcient recycle gas off thehigh-pressure separator to maintain the recycle gas purity requirements.DISTILLATE HYDROCRACKING 319
Nitrogen and methane content
The total of the nitrogen and methane contained in the makeup gas is only harmful asa diluent, i.e., it will reduce the hydrogen partial pressure and as long as the minimumhydrogen purity is maintained, it will not affect the unit. However, it should be notedthat excessive quantities of molecular nitrogen entering a hydrocracker in the makeupgas stream can cause a buildup of nitrogen in the recycle gas since the nitrogen is non-condensible. If this is the case, the nitrogen will have to be removed from the reactorcircuit by a small, continuous purge of recycle gas off the high-pressure separator.
CO+CO
2content
The normal speciﬁcation for CO plus CO 2in the makeup gas stream to a Hydrocracker
is in low two-digit mol-ppm maximum. Larger quantities can have a harmful effect
on catalyst activity. CO is considered the worst impurity due to the fact that it has alimited solubility in both hydrocarbon and water and will, therefore, build up in therecycle gas. CO
2, on the other hand, is much more soluble and is readily removed
from the system in the high-pressure separator liquids.
Both CO and CO 2have similar effects on the Hydrocracking catalyst; they are con-
verted on the active sites of the catalyst in the presence of hydrogen to methane and
water. This methanation of CO and CO 2competes with the normal hydrocarbon reac-
tants for the catalyst. Therefore, if CO +CO 2is allowed to build up, higher catalyst
temperatures will be required. In an extreme case where a large quantity of CO or CO 2"
"would be introduced to the Hydrocracker in a short period of time, it is theoreticallypossible that a temperature excursion would result since the methanation reaction ishighly exothermic.
It is recommended practice that if the CO +CO
2content exceeds the maximum design
limit, the catalyst temperature should not be increased to compensate for a resulting
decrease in conversion. Catalyst temperature should be maintained at the same levelor reduced until the problem causing the high CO +CO
2is eliminated. In this way
the catalyst will not be harmed by increased deactivation at a higher temperature andit will also eliminate the possibility of a temperature runaway due to methanation.
Hydrocracker licensors and catalyst manufacturers
LicensorsHydrocracking licensing started in 1960. Chevron, UOP , Unocal, Shell and Exxon
were active from the beginning. Since that time, some 250 hydrocrackers have beenlicensed worldwide. As of the beginning of 2001, 154 hydrocrackers were in opera-tion. Through the years, the licensing ‘landscape’ has changed. Currently, the activelicensors are Chevron, EMAK (ExxonMobil-Akzo Nobel-Kellogg), IFP and UOP .320 CHAPTER 7

Hydrotreating
Adrian Gruia (retired)*
Hydrotreating or catalytic hydrogen treating removes objectionable materials from
petroleum fractions by selectively reacting these materials with hydrogen in a reactorat relatively high temperatures at moderate pressures. These objectionable materialsinclude, but are not solely limited to, sulfur, nitrogen, oleﬁns, and aromatics. Thelighter materials such as naphtha are generally treated for subsequent processing incatalytic reforming units, and the heavier distillates, ranging from jet fuel to heavyvacuum gas oils, are treated to meet strict product quality speciﬁcations or for useas feedstocks elsewhere in the reﬁnery. Hydrotreating is also used for upgrading thequality of atmospheric resids by reducing their sulfur and organo-metallics level.Many of the product quality speciﬁcation are driven by environmental regulationsthat are becoming more stringent every year. Hydrotreaters are designed for and runat a variety of conditions depending on many factors such as type of feed, desiredcycle length, expected quality of the products but in general they will operate atthe following range of conditions: LHSV —0.2 to 8.0, H
2circulation—300 to 4,000
SCFB (50–675 Nm3/m3), H 2PP—200–2,000 psia (14–138 bars) and SOR tempera-
tures ranging between 550 and 700◦F (290–370◦C), with the lower limits representing
minimum operating conditions for naphtha hydrotreating and the higher values show-ing operating conditions used for hydrotreating atmospheric resids. Until about 1980,hydrotreating was a licensed technology being offered by a fairly large number ofcompanies. In the past 25 years, hydrotreating catalysts have become commoditiesand the process has been offered without licensing fees.
The common objectives and applications of hydrotreating are listed below:
rNaphtha (catalytic reformer feed pretreatment)—to remove sulfur, nitrogen, and
metals that otherwise would poison downstream noble metal reforming catalysts
rKerosene and diesel—to remove sulfur and to saturate oleﬁns and some of the

aromatics, resulting in improved properties of the streams (kerosene smoke point,
diesel cetane number or diesel index) as well as storage stability
rLube oil—to improve the viscosity index, color, and stability as well as storagestability
rFCC feed—to improve FCC yields, reduce catalyst usage and stack emissions
rResids—to provide low sulfur fuel oils to effect conversion and/or pretreatment forfurther conversion downstream.
Brief history
Hydrotreating has its origin in the hydrogenation work done by Sabatier and"
"Senderens, who in 1897 published their discovery that unsaturated hydrocarbonscould be hydrogenated in the vapor phase over a nickel catalyst. In 1904, Ipatieffextended the range of feasible hydrogenation reactions by the introduction of ele-vated hydrogen pressures. At the time, the progress of the automobile industry wasexpected to entail a considerable increase in the consumption of gasoline. This led tothe experimental work by Bergius, started in 1910 in Hanover, Germany who soughtto produce gasoline by cracking heavy oils and oil residues as well as convertingcoal to liquid fuels. He realized that to remedy the inferior quality of the unsaturatedgasoline so produced, the hydrogen removed mostly in the form of methane during thecracking operation has to be replaced by addition of new hydrogen. Thus, formationof coke was avoided and the gasoline produced was of a rather saturated character.Bergius also noted that the sulfur contained in the oils was eliminated for the mostp a r ta sH
2S. Ferric oxide was used in the Bergius process to remove the sulfur. Ac-
tually, the ferric oxide and sulﬁdes formed in the process acted as catalysts, thoughthe activity was very poor. The ﬁrst plant for hydrogenation of brown coal was puton stream in Leuna Germany in 1927. The past large scale industrial development ofhydrogenation in Europe, particularly in Germany, was due entirely to military con-siderations. Germany used hydrogenation extensively during World War II to producegasoline: 3.5 million tons were produced in 1944. The ﬁrst commercial hydroreﬁninginstallation in the United States was at the Standard Oil Company of Louisiana inBaton Rouge in the 1930s. WWII plants were developed by Humble Oil and ReﬁningCompany and Shell Development Company, though there was considerably less de-pendence on hydrogenation as a source of gasoline. Even though hydrogenation hasbeen of interest to the petroleum industry for many years, little commercial use ofhydrogen-consuming processes has been made because of the lack of low-cost hy-drogen. That changed in the early 1950s with the advent of catalytic reforming whichmade available by-product hydrogen. That brought up an extensive and increasedinterest in processes that will utilize this hydrogen to upgrade petroleum stocks. Asa result of the enormous growth of hydrotreating, as of the beginning of 2001, therewere more than 1,600 hydrotreaters operating in the world with a total capacity inexcess of 39,000,000 B/D (4,800,000 MT/D).HYDROTREATING 323

Flow schemes
Although the ‘hydrotreating process’ has several different applications (e.g. desulfu-
rization, oleﬁn saturation, denitrogenation, etc) and is used for a variety of petroleumfractions from naphtha all the way to atmospheric residue, practically all units havethe same ﬂow scheme. It consists of a higher-pressure reactor section and a lowerpressure fractionation section. This is shown very schematically in Figure 8.1 and isdescribed below in general terms.
Reactor section
The reactor section consists of the following major pieces of equipment: feed/efﬂuent
exchangers, reactor charge heater, reactor(s), reactor efﬂuent condenser, products sep-arator, recycle gas compressor, and make-up gas compressors. Additionally, severalother pieces of equipment are found in some hydrotreating units: fresh feed ﬁlters,reactor efﬂuent hot separator, recycle gas scrubber. Figure 8.2 shows a schematic ﬂowdiagram of a reactor section including all the equipment, which is listed above.
Feed ﬁlters
It is preferable to route the feed directly from an upstream unit without going throughintermediate storage. When storage facilities are used, feed ﬁlters are (should be)used. The purpose of the ﬁlters is to retain the particulate matter (mostly corrosionproducts) picked by the feed while in storage. The feed ﬁlters are either automaticbackwash ﬁlters operating on a pressure drop setting or manual cartridge (disposable)ﬁlters.
Feed/efﬂuent exchangers
In the most commonly used heat recovery scheme, the reactor efﬂuent in a series offeed/efﬂuent exchangers preheats the reactor charge before entering the reactor chargeheater. This recovers as much heat as possible from the heat of reaction. Liquid feedmay be preheated separately with reactor efﬂuent exchange before combining withthe recycle gas depending on the heat integration scheme.324 CHAPTER 8

Reactor charge heater"
"In most units, the combined feed and recycle gas is heated together to desired re-actor inlet temperature in a combined charge heater. In units processing heavy feed,especially the atmospheric residue units, the liquid feed is preheated separately withreactor efﬂuent exchange and only the recycle gas is heated in the heater upstream ofthe reactor.
Make-up hydrogen system
Make-up H
2is typically obtained from hydrogen manufacturing plants and/or naphtha
reforming units. Depending on the pressure of the hydrotreating unit, the make-uphydrogen might have to be compressed before introduction into the unit. Reciprocatingcompressors are used for this service. The make-up gas is introduced into recycle gassystem.
Recycle hydrogen system
After the separation of gas and liquid phases in the separator, the gas goes to the recyclegas compressor. In some cases, the recycle gas will be sent ﬁrst to an amine scrubberto remove most of the H
2S. Most often, the recycle gas compressor is a separate
centrifugal machine, but it could also be a part of the make-up gas compressors, asHYDROTREATING 325
additional cylinders. The recycle gas compressor is designed to pump a large volume
of gas at a relatively low compression ratio.
Recycle gas scrubbing
The recycle gas stream will contain H 2S. The H 2S reduces the hydrogen partial
pressure and thus suppresses the catalyst activity. This effect is more pronouncedwith high sulfur containing feed stream and for the same feedstock, the heavier thecut, the higher the sulfur content is. Recycle gas scrubbing is typically included inthe design if the H
2S recycle gas content is expected to be in excess of 3 vol%.
Reactor(s)Once the feed and recycle gas have been heated to the desired temperature, the reac-tants enter the top of the reactor. As the reactants ﬂow downward through the catalystbed, various exothermic reactions (which will be explained later) occur and the tem-perature increases. Multiple catalyst beds (and possibly additional reactor may berequired depending on the heat of reaction, unit capacity and/or type of hydrotreatingunit (its intended goal). Speciﬁc reactor designs will depend upon several variables.Reactor diameter is typically set by the cross-sectional liquid ﬂux. As the unit capacityincreases, the reactor diameter increases to the point where two parallel trains wouldbe considered. Reactor height is a function of the amount of catalyst and number ofbeds required. Depending on the expected heat of reaction, cold recycle gas is broughtinto the reactor at the interbed quench points in order to cool the reactants and thuscontrol the reaction rate. Good distribution of reactants at the reactor inlet and at thetop of each subsequent catalyst bed is essential for optimum catalyst performance.There are many companies that design proprietary internals. These internals are re-actor inlet diffuser, top liquid distribution tray, quench section which includes quenchinlet assembly, quench and reactants mixing device and redistribution tray, as wellas the reactor outlet device. As indicated, not all reactors contain all the internalsdescribed above.
Reactor efﬂuent water wash
Most of the cooling of the efﬂuent is accomplished in the feed/efﬂuent exchangers.Final cooling of the reactor efﬂuent is obtained in air ﬁn coolers and/or water trimcoolers. Water is injected into the stream before it enters the coolers in order to preventthe deposition of salts that can corrode and foul the coolers. The sulfur and nitrogencontained in the feed are converted to hydrogen sulﬁde and ammonia in the reac-tor. These two reaction products combine to form ammonium salts that can solidifyand precipitate as the reactor efﬂuent is cooled. Likewise, ammonium chloride maybe formed if there is any chloride in the system. The purpose of the water is to keepthe H
2S and NH 3in solution and not allow them to precipitate. Various companies
have slightly different guidelines for the quality of the water injection, but in generaluse of boiler feed water is preferred.326 CHAPTER 8
V apor/liquid separation
The exact method of separating vapor and liquid will vary depending on the optimumheat integration scheme. Up to four separate vessels may be used to disengage andindividually remove vapor, water and hydrocarbon liquid. A hot separator is sometimesinstalled after the feed/efﬂuent exchangers to collect the heavier hydrocarbon materialfrom the reactor efﬂuent and send it to fractionation via the hot ﬂash drum. Theoverhead vapor from the hot separator continues through an air cooler into a coldseparator. The two-separator system offers an improved heat integration scheme (allthis is shown in Figure 8.2).
Hydrogen puriﬁcation
Increasing the recycle gas hydrogen purity will decrease the catalyst deactivation rate.Depending upon the feedstock and type of unit, additional measures may be takento increase the hydrogen purity. These measures may include hydrogen enrichmentand/or membrane separation."

The function of the fractionation section is to separate the reactor efﬂuent into the de-
sired products. This can accomplished with either a one or a two-column fractionationscheme, depending on the type of hydrotreating unit.
In the two columns scheme the ﬂash drum liquids combine and go to a stripper column.
Steam and/or a ﬁred heater is used to strip naphtha (if desired) and lighter materialoverhead. The stripper bottoms go to a fractionator where it is further separated intonaphtha (if desired) and heavier products. The fractionator feed is typically preheatedwith fractionator bottoms and a ﬁred heater before entering the column. Strippingsteam is used to drive lighter material up the column and various product strippersare used to pull sidecut products to the desired speciﬁcations.
Chemistry
The following chemical steps and/or reactions occur during the hydrotreating process
(depending on the impurities present):
rSulfur removal, also referred to as desulfurization or hydro-desulfurization (HDS)in which the organic sulfur compounds are converted to hydrogen sulﬁde
rNitrogen removal, also referred to as denitrogenation or hydro-denitrogenation(HDN) in which the organic nitrogen compounds are converted to ammonia
r(organo-metallic) metals removal, also referred to as hydro-demetallation or hydro-demetallization, in which the organo-metals are converted to the respective metalsulﬁdes
roxygen removal, in which the organic oxygen compounds are converted to water
roleﬁn saturation, in which organic compounds containing double bonds are con-verted to their saturated homologues
raromatic saturation, also referred to as hydro-dearomatization, in which some ofthe aromatic compounds are converted to naphthenes
rand halides removal, in which the organic halides are converted to hydrogen halides
The ﬁrst three types of compounds are always present though in varying amountsdepending on the source of feed stock. For example, naphtha will contain extremelylow amounts of organo-metallic compounds while atmospheric residues will containlevels in % range. Some crudes contain much more sulfur in all the fractions whencompared with other crudes (for example, most middle eastern crudes contain muchmore sulfur than some crudes from Indonesia or North Africa). The same is true fornitrogen levels, as well. The other impurities are not always present. In general, thehydrotreating reactions proceed in the following descending order of ease: (organo-metallic) metals removal, oleﬁn saturation, sulfur removal, nitrogen removal, oxygenremoval, and halide removal. Some aromatic saturation also occurs. The chemistry ofresidue hydrotreating is essentially that of contaminant removal and selective hydro-genation which includes both oleﬁn and aromatic saturation. Hydrogen is consumed328 CHAPTER 8
in all the reactions. The contaminant removal in residue hydrotreating involves con-
trolled breaking of the hydrocarbon molecule at the point where the sulfur, nitrogen oroxygen atom is joined to carbon atoms. Some cracking occurs in residue hydrotreat-ing, but it normally is less than 20 vol% of the fresh feed charge.
In general, the desulfurization reaction consumes 100–150 SCFB/wt% change
(17–25 Nm
3/m3/wt% change) and the denitrogenation reaction consumes 200–350
SCFB/wt% change (34–59 Nm3/m3/wt% change). Typically, the heat released in hy-
drotreating is about 0.02◦F/SCFB H 2consumed (0.002◦C/Nm3/m3H2).
In general, the ‘main messages’ concerning hydrotreating reaction rates, heats ofreaction and hydrogen consumption are:
rDesulfurization and oleﬁn saturation are the most rapid reactions
rOleﬁn saturation liberates the most heat per unit of hydrogen consumed
rDenitrogenation and aromatic saturation are the most difﬁcult reactions
rHydrogen consumption and heat of reaction are related
Sulfur removal
Sulfur removal occurs via the conversion to H
2S of the organic sulfur compounds
present in the feedstock. This conversion is sometimes referred to as desulfuriza-"
"tion or hydro-desulfurization (HDS). Sulfur is found throughout the boiling range ofpetroleum fractions in the form of many hundreds of different organic sulfur com-pounds which, in the naphtha to atmospheric residue range, can all be classiﬁed asbelonging to one of the following six sulfur types: mercaptans, sulﬁdes, di-sulﬁdes,thiophenes, benzo-thiophenes, and di-benzo-thiophenes. Typical reactions for eachkind of sulfur compound are shown below.

Most of the reactions are straightforward with the exception of the desulfurization
of aromatic sulfur species. This reaction is more complex because it must start withring opening and sulfur removal followed by saturation of the resulting oleﬁn. Thepostulated mechanism for the desulfurization reaction is shown below: ﬁrst, the sulfuris removed followed by the saturation of the intermediate oleﬁn compound. In theexample below the thiophene is converted to butene as an intermediate which is thensaturated into butane.

Easiest to remove →Hardest to remove
Mercaptans →Sulﬁdes →Disulﬁdes →Thiophenes →Benzo-thiophenes →
Dibenzo-thiophenes
The relative ease of removing sulfur from a particular hydrocarbon fraction depends
greatly on the sulfur types present. In naphtha fractions, much of the sulfur is presentas mercaptans and sulﬁdes which makes for relatively easy sulfur removal. In gasoil fractions, the majority of the sulfur is present as benzo-thiophenes and di-benzo-thiophenes. Hence the sulfur is much more difﬁcult to remove from gas oils thanfrom naphtha fractions. And the more difﬁcult sulfur species are found in the heavier330 CHAPTER 8
fractions, which means that heavy gas oils are more difﬁcult to treat than light gas oils.
As an example of the relative degree of desulfurization: if the degree of difﬁculty ofconverting the di-ethylsulﬁde were 1, thiophene is 5 times more difﬁcult to convert,benzo-thiophene is 15 times more difﬁcult to convert, and di-benzo-thiophene is 20times more difﬁcult to convert.
Nitrogen removal
Nitrogen is mostly found in the heaviest end of petroleum fractions in ﬁve- and six-
membered aromatic ring structures. Both the molecular complexity and quantity ofnitrogen containing molecules increases with increasing boiling range, making themmore difﬁcult to remove. The denitrogenation reaction proceeds through a differentpath from that of desulfurization. While in desulfurization the sulfur is removed ﬁrstand the oleﬁn created as an intermediate is saturated, in denitrogenation, the aromaticis saturated ﬁrst and then the nitrogen is removed. This is shown below.

Nitrogen is more difﬁcult to remove and consumes more hydrogen than sulfur removal
because the reaction mechanism involves aromatic ring saturation prior to nitrogenremoval. In desulfurization, the sulfur is less often associated with aromatic ringsand when it is, the sulfur can be removed without ring saturation. Hydrogenation ofassociated aromatic ring structures is very dependent on hydrogen partial pressureand is the rate limiting reaction step in nitrogen removal. Nitrogen removal is thereforedependent on H
2partial pressure.
Oxygen removal
Most petroleum crudes contain low levels of oxygen. The oxygen-containing com-
pounds are converted, by hydrogenation, to the corresponding hydrocarbon and water.The lower molecular weight compounds are easily hydrogenated, however, the highermolecular weight compounds—e.g. furans—can be difﬁcult to remove. Shown beloware typical examples of de-oxygenation.

Oleﬁn saturation
Oleﬁns are not found in petroleum, but are formed when processed in thermal or"
"catalytic units. In general, fractions containing oleﬁns are unstable and thus must beprotected from contact with oxygen prior to hydrotreating to prevent the formationof polymer gums. That is especially true for feedstocks derived from thermal crack-ing operations such as coking and ethylene manufacturing. Typical oleﬁn saturationreactions are shown below.
Hexene
C
6H12+H2→C6H14
Cyclohexene

Oleﬁn saturation reactions are very rapid and highly exothermic. While the deni-
trogenation reaction shows a heat of reaction of 1 Btu/lb of feed for each 100 ft3
of H 2consumed, and the desulfurization reaction generates 1 Btu/lb of feed for
each 10 ft3H2consumed, the oleﬁn saturation generates 1 Btu/lb of feed for each
2f t3of H 2consumed. If proper care is not exercised during operations, it can re-
sult in mechanical problems such as excessive coking that can lead to pressure dropbuild up and/or poor liquid ﬂow distribution through the catalyst bed(s). Dioleﬁnsare readily hydrogenated to oleﬁns at low temperatures (<400
◦F , or less than about
200◦C).
Aromatic saturation
Saturation of aromatics is desirable for improvement of the properties of petroleum
products e.g. smoke point, diesel index, etc. The aromatics found in the naphtha togas oil boiling range are present as one, two, and three ring aromatics—often referredto as mono, di, and tri aromatics. Typical reactions are shown below
One ring—Toluene
+ 3H 2-CH 3-CH 3HYDROTREATING 333
Two ring—Naphthalene
+  3H 2
Three ring—Phenanthrene
+ 3H 2
+ 3H 2
The reactions shown above provide the mechanism by which poly saturates aromatics.
That occurs via a stepwise mechanism; i.e. from 3-ring to 2-ring to 1-ring; and the endproducts are naphthane rings. Ring opening does not occur in hydrotreating (it does inhydrocracking) because there is very little hydrocracking function within a standardhydrotreating catalyst. The aromatic saturation reaction is strongly favored by high hy-drogen partial pressure. Unlike all the other hydrotreating reactions, the amount ofconversion of aromatics becomes equilibrium limited at higher operating tempera-tures within the commercial operating range. This is because the reverse reactionof naphthene dehydrogenation becomes favored when temperature is increased. Theoptimum temperature for maximum aromatic saturation depends on LHSV , hydrogenpartial pressure and catalyst type, but typically lies in the range 320–350
◦C.
Mono aromatic rings are much more difﬁcult to saturate than the di and tri aromaticrings because the saturation of the last aromatic ring requires the most energy. Thismeans that as aromatic saturation proceeds, there is little progress in total aromat-ics reduction until most, if not all, of the di and tri aromatics have been saturated.The complete saturation of aromatics requires signiﬁcantly more severe processingconditions than those used in ‘normal’ hydrotreating.
Metals removal
Most metallic impurities occur in naphthas and middle distillates at ppm or even ppb
levels. They are present as organo-metallic compounds. In naphtha hydrotreating, themost commonly occurring metals are arsenic from certain crude sources, mercury334 CHAPTER 8
from certain condensates and silicon from anti-foam agents used in visbreakers and
cokers. These compounds decompose in the hydrotreater and the metal is depositedon the catalyst in the form of metal sulﬁde as shown below.
R-Me +H
2S→R-H 2+MeS
Once deposited, these metals contribute to catalyst deactivation and unlike coke are notremoved by regeneration. Gas oil streams can contain traces of nickel and vanadium inthe heavier feedstock fractions. These too are deposited on the catalyst and contributeto deactivation. Atmospheric residua can contain metals, almost exclusive Ni and V ,in the three-digit ppm range. Demetallation of that type of feedstock is an importantgoal of processing and special demetallation catalyst is employed for that purpose.Demetallation occurs before desulfurization and any conversion of the feedstock takesplace.
Halide removal
Organic halides, such as chlorides or bromides, can be present in petroleum fractions
at trace levels. Under hydrotreating conditions, organic halides are largely convertedto the corresponding hydrocarbon and hydrogen halide. The typical reaction is shownbelow.
+  4H 2 +  HCl-CH 2-CH2-CH 2-Cl -CH 2-CH 2-CH 3
Catalysts
Hydrotreating catalysts are high surface area materials consisting of an active compo-
nent and a promoter, which are uniformly dispersed on a support. The catalyst supportis normally gamma alumina (γ -Al
2O3), sometimes with small amounts of silica or"
"phosphorous added, which is prepared in such a way so as to give a high surface areaand an appropriate pore structure. The active component is normally molybdenumsulﬁde, although tungsten containing catalysts are also used (though seldom, and thatgenerally for special applications such as lube oil processing). For molybdenum cat-alysts both cobalt (CoMo) and nickel (NiMo) are used as promoters. The promoterhas the effect of substantially increasing (approximately 100-fold) the activity of theactive metal sulﬁde. The acidity of the support (which is provided by the silica and/orphosphorous) can be increased to boost the catalyst activity for (hydro)cracking andisomerization reactions. The commercially available catalysts have varying amountsof promoters and active components, depending on the desired applications, but inHYDROTREATING 335

rHollow rings Up to 1/4/prime/prime
The size and shape of the catalyst pieces is a compromise between the wish to minimizepore diffusion effects in the catalyst particles (requiring small sizes) and pressuredrop across the reactor (requiring large particle sizes). The physical characteristicsof catalysts also vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and the intended use of thecatalyst, but in general are as follows:
rHigh surface area 150 m

rPore volume 0.6–1.0 ml/g
rAverage pore radius 30–100 Angstrom
rCompacted bulk density 35–55 lbd/ft3

rAverage length (except spheres) 1/8–3/8 in
Cobalt–Moly Catalysts
By and large, CoMo catalysts have been designed primarily for desulfurization, but
some denitrogenation and demetallation is also achieved. These catalysts can treatfeedstocks of widely varying properties. CoMo catalysts have the lowest hydrogena-tion activity, therefore they have the lowest hydrogen consumption for a given sulfur336 CHAPTER 8
removal. They also have the lowest sensitivity of H 2consumption to changes in operat-
ing pressure. In general, CoMo catalysts have the highest desulfurization performance
at the lower operating pressures (<600 psig, or <∼ 40 barg). These catalysts also have
the lowest denitrogenation performance due to low hydrogenation activity. BecauseCoMo catalysts exhibit the highest sulfur removal per unit of hydrogen consumed,they are best suited for desulfurization at lower pressures and when hydrogen is inshort supply.
Nickel–Moly catalysts
NiMo catalysts have been designed for desulfurization, but particularly for hydrogena-
tion and denitrogenation. Metal removal can also be achieved. These catalysts can treatfeedstocks of widely varying properties. NiMo catalysts have higher denitrogenationactivities than CoMo and are therefore used for cracked stocks or other applicationswhere denitrogenation and/or saturation is as important as desulfurization. The higherhydrogenation power of NiMo catalysts allows them to be used as a topping layer tosaturate oleﬁns and other gum precursors to mitigate catalyst bed fouling leadingto pressure drop accumulation and poor liquid ﬂow distribution through the catalystbed. The performance of NiMo catalysts is very good at high pressures. NiMo cata-lysts show a greater response in denitrogenation and desulfurization performance tochanges in H
2partial pressure than CoMo. High-pressure operations, such as FCC
and hydrocracking feed pretreatment, therefore favor the use of NiMo catalysts. NiMocatalyst use is also favored for reforming units pretreating as the modern reformingcatalysts are very sensitive to the nitrogen content of the feedstock.
Other catalysts
Other catalysts used in hydrotreating are NiW and NiCoMo. NiW catalysts have
applications in treating feeds where higher hydrogenation activity is required than isavailable from either NiMo or CoMo. In general, their desulfurization activity is poorat the pressure levels used in hydrotreating—they perform very well however, at thehigh pressures used in hydrocracking. NiW in sulﬁded form exhibits hydrocrackingactivity surpassing that of both CoMo and NiMo. Increasing the activity of the supportmaterial with promoters or zeolite can further enhance the hydrocracking activity.NiW can be made selective for saturating one of the double bonds in dioleﬁns in lightfeeds, which may be desirable in some hydrotreating operations. NiCoMo catalystsattempt to combine the beneﬁts of CoMo and NiMo, however, they are rarely used.
Measuring catalyst performance
Catalyst performance is measured by several criteria shown below, which are more
or less self-explanatory:HYDROTREATING 337"

Catalyst manufacturing
Hydrotreating catalysts contain metals dispersed on a support. That support is γ-
alumina which is arrived at by synthesis. Several raw materials can be used to produce
theγ-alumina:
rGibbsite (α -alumina trihydrate)
rBayerite (β -alumina trihydrate)
rBoehmite (α -alumina monohydrate)
Hydrotreating catalysts can be manufactured by several methods:
rImpregnation
rCo-mulling
rHot soaking
Impregnation
When catalyst is manufactured by the impregnation the support is ﬁrst made, followed
by loading of the support with metals, by wet impregnation. The support can bemanufactured either in spherical shape or by extrusion.
Figure 8.5 shows the preparation of spherical support by the oil drop method. Figure
8.6 shows support preparation by extrusion. The support, either spherical or extrudedis then ﬁnished by wet impregnation as shown in Figure 8.7. Figure 8.8 depictshydrotreating catalyst manufactured by co-mulling. Figure 8.9 shows the schematicof catalyst manufacturing by hot soaking.338 CHAPTER 8

Catalyst loading and activation
Catalyst loadingThere are two methods of catalyst loading: sock loading and dense loading. Pouring
catalyst into a hopper mounted on top of the reactor and then allowing it to ﬂowthrough a canvas sock into the reactor is sock loading. Dense loading or dense bedpacking is done with the help of a mechanical device. The dense loading methodwas introduced in the mid 1970s. Catalyst loaded by sock loading will have a highervoid fraction than catalyst that was dense loaded. Dense bed packing and the resultinghigher pressure drop provides a more even distribution of liquid in a trickle ﬂow reactorwhich is the ﬂow regime for most hydrotreating applications. If diffusion limitationsare negligible, dense loading is desirable in order to maximize the reaction rate per unitreactor volume. This is often the case in hydrotreating reactors. The other advantageof dense loading is that it orients the catalyst particles in a horizontal and uniformmanner. This improves the vapor/liquid distribution through the catalyst beds. Catalystparticle orientation is important especially for shaped extruded catalyst in vapor/liquidreactant systems. When the catalyst particles are oriented in a horizontal position in thecatalyst bed, liquid maldistribution or channeling is eliminated. This maldistributiontends to occur when the catalyst loading is done by the sock loading method, whichgenerally causes the extrudates to be oriented in a downward slant toward the reactorwalls increasing bed voids and creating liquid maldistribution. Of all the factorsinﬂuencing catalyst utilization, catalyst loading has generally proven to be the mostimportant factor. Another advantage of dense loading is that it allows loading morecatalyst in the reactor because of the reduced void fraction in the catalyst bed. Asmuch as 15–20% more catalyst can be loaded when dense loading, compared withsock loading. Thus, the catalyst life can be extended or else the unit can be operatedat more severe conditions (lower product sulfur level, increased feed rate) than if thecatalyst had been sock loaded. Except for the hydrotreaters that have reactor pressuredrop limitations mainly due to operation at higher than design throughputs, mosthydrotreaters are dense loaded. Ex-situ presulfurized catalysts (see catalyst activation)HYDROTREATING 341"
"are self-heating materials. Thus, they should be loaded in an inert atmosphere though
some loading contractors do load them under air atmosphere.
Catalyst activationHydrotreating catalysts have to be activated in order to be catalytically active. The
activation of the catalyst (going from the oxidic to the sulﬁde state) is commonlycalled sulﬁding, though several other names are used to describe the same thing. Othernames that are used to describe catalyst activation are presulﬁding or presulfurizing.The metals on the catalysts are in an oxide form at the completion of the manufacturingprocess. The catalysts are activated by transforming the catalytically inactive metaloxides into active metal sulﬁdes (thus the name sulﬁding). This is accomplishedmainly in-situ though more and more reﬁners have started to use catalyst which had thesulﬁding compound loaded onto the catalyst outside the unit (ex-situ presulfurization).It is likely more and more reﬁners will opt to receive the catalyst at the reﬁnerysite in presulﬁded state to accelerate the start up of the unit and because it is moreenvironmentally friendly (eliminates the sometimes unpleasant odor evolved whenthe sulﬁding compound is introduced into the unit).
In-situ sulﬁding can be accomplished either in vapor or liquid phase. In vapor phase
sulﬁding, the activation of the catalyst is accomplished by injecting a chemical whichdecomposes easily to H
2S, such as di-methyl-di-sulphide (DMDS) or di-methyl-
sulﬁde (DMS); use of H 2S was fairly common until a few years ago, but now it
is only rarely used because of environmental and safety concerns. Liquid phase sul-ﬁding can be accomplished with or without spiked feedstocks. In the latter case, thefeedstock is generally a gas oil type material that contains sulfur compounds in rangesfrom a few thousand to twenty thousand ppm. The H
2S necessary for the activation of
the catalyst is generated by the decomposition of the sulfur compounds. This methodis in very little use today, but it was ‘state of the art’ in the 1960s and early 1970s.The preferred sulﬁding procedure in the industry is liquid phase with a spiking agent(generally DMDS). It results in savings of time when compared to either vapor phaseor liquid phase without spiking agents. In addition to the time savings, liquid phasesulﬁding is desirable because the liquid phase provides a heat sink for the exothermicsulﬁding reactions which helps prevent high catalyst temperatures and temperatureexcursions which could otherwise result in metals reduction. Another advantage ofliquid phase over gas phase sulﬁding is that by having all the catalyst particles wetfrom the very beginning there is very little chance of catalyst bed channeling whichcan occur if the catalyst particles are allowed to dry out. The in-situ sulﬁding occursat temperatures between 450 and 600
◦F (230–315◦C) regardless of the method used.
Some catalyst manufacturers recommend the sulﬁding be conducted at full operatingpressure while others prefer it be done at pressures lower than the normal operatingpressure.342 CHAPTER 8
In the case of ex-situ presulfurization of catalyst, sulfur compounds are loaded onto
the catalyst. The activation occurs when the catalyst, which has been loaded in thereactor, is heated up in the presence of hydrogen. The activation can be conductedeither in vapor or liquid phase. Generally, activation of ex-situ presulfurized catalyst isaccomplished faster than if the sulﬁding is done in-situ, however, there is the additionalexpense due to the need for the ex-situ presulfurization step.
Catalyst deactivation and regeneration
Catalyst deactivation is the gradual loss of the catalyst’ s ability to produce the de-
sired speciﬁcation product unless reactor temperatures are increased (or feed rate isdecreased). The catalyst activity determination is shown under “catalysts.” It can beseen that as the run progresses, the catalyst loses activity. Catalyst will lose activityin several ways described below.
Coke depositionCoke is the term used to describe the formation of hydrogen deﬁcient carbonaceous
materials, most particularly on the catalyst surface. Coke is generally formed bythermal condensation, catalytic dehydrogenation and polymerization reactions. Aschematic of this is shown below.

The coke level rapidly rises to an equilibrium level during the early part of a catalyst"
"cycle. This initial coke is often referred to as ‘soft’ coke. During the rest of the cycle,the total amount of coke remains almost constant, however further structural changesoccur to produce what is often referred to as ‘hard’ coke. Thus, the observed catalystdeactivation during a cycle is primarily the result of structural changes to the cokerather than an actual marked increase in the total amount of coke. Short term recoveryof catalyst activity has been observed on a number of occasions after a period of hothydrogen stripping. This ﬁts with the expectation that soft coke should be able to bepartially stripped or washed from the catalyst.
As can be seen from the reaction schematic, the route to coke precursors formation is
dehydrogenation. Hydrogen deﬁcient feedstocks (i.e., cracked stocks) therefore resultin faster coke deactivation. High temperatures favor faster coke deactivation becausethe laydown of coke on a catalyst is a time-temperature phenomenon in that the longerHYDROTREATING 343
the exposure and/or the higher the temperature the catalyst is subjected to, the more
severe the deactivating effect. Coke is not a permanent poison. Catalyst, which hasbeen deactivated by coke deposition, can be, relatively easily, restored to close tooriginal condition by regeneration. Low hydrogen partial pressures also favor cokeformation. In general, the heavier feedstock will produce higher levels of coke on thecatalyst. In general, the maximum coke laydown is about 20 wt%.
Metals depositionDeposition of metals is not reversible, even with catalyst regeneration. The metals
may come into the system via additives, such as silicon compounds used in cokedrums to reduce foaming, or feedstock contaminants such as Pb, Fe, As, P , Na, Ca,Mg, or as organo-metallic compounds in the feed primarily containing Ni and V . Thedeposition of Ni and V takes place at the pore entrances or near the outer surface ofthe catalyst, creating a ‘rind’ layer—effectively choking off access to the interior partof the catalyst, where most of the surface area resides.
Catalyst support sinteringThis is another reason for loss of catalyst activity and it also is irreversible. This
is also a result of high temperatures and particularly in connection with high waterpartial pressures. In this case the catalyst support material can lose surface area froma collapse of pores, or from an increase in the diameter of pores, with the pore volumeremaining approximately constant.
Catalyst regenerationThe activity decline due to coke laydown can be recovered by burning the coke off in a
controlled atmosphere. The regeneration can be accomplished in either of three ways:in-situ with steam/air, in-situ with nitrogen/air or ex-situ. The majority of commer-cial catalysts regeneration, at least in the industrialized world is performed ex-situ, byspecialized contractors, because of environmental considerations as well as becauseit results in a better performing catalyst. Upon combustion, coke is converted to CO
2
and H 2O. In the absence of excess oxygen, CO may also form. Hydrotreating catalysts
contain sulfur, as the metals are in a sulﬁde form. In the regeneration process, themetal sulﬁdes are converted into the corresponding metal oxides and the sulfur will beemitted as SO
2. In general, sulfur oxide emission starts at lower temperature than CO 2
emission. There are several companies that perform ex-situ regeneration by using dif-ferent equipment for burning off the coke. One company uses a continuous rotolouver,which is a cylindrical drum rotating slowly on a horizontal axis and enclosing a seriesof overlapping louvers. The spent catalyst passes slowly through the rotolouver, whereit encounters a countercurrent of hot air. Another company uses a porous moving beltas a regenerator. The catalyst is moved with the stainless steel belt through a stationary344 CHAPTER 8
tunnel furnace vessel where the regeneration takes place. A third company regener-
ator uses ebullated bed technology to perform the catalyst regeneration. Regardlessof the process, the spent catalyst is submitted to de-oiling prior to regeneration. Thisis to eliminate as much hydrocarbon as possible as well as to remove as much sulfuras possible to prevent formation of sulfates which could deposit on the catalyst andnot be removed during regeneration. Sulfates are deleterious to catalyst performance.While the in-situ regeneration results in about 90% catalyst activity recovery, ex-situcatalyst regeneration results in 95–97% catalyst activity recovery.
Design and operation of hydrotreating reactors
Design and construction of hydrotreating reactorsHydrotreating reactors are downﬂow, ﬁxed-bed catalytic reactors, generally operating"
"in trickle ﬂow regime. Because hydrotreating occurs at moderately high pressure andrelatively high temperature and in the presence of hydrogen and hydrogen sulﬁde,the reactors are vessels with relatively thick wall. The reactors are usually cylindricalvessels and while those use for naphtha hydrotreating as well as many of the older vin-tage reactors are made from lower alloys, most of those designed in the last 10 years,are typically constructed of 1
1/4Cr–1/2Mo or 21/4Cr–1 Mo base metal with a lining
of stabilized austenitic stainless steel for added corrosion protection. This choice ofalloys gives the high strength of the base metal and the excellent corrosion resistanceof the inner lining. There are several items concerning the selection of materials thatmust be taken into consideration during the operation of the unit. Concerning the useof austenitic stainless steels in Hydrotreating units, the possibility exists for corrosioncracking to occur if the proper procedures are not followed. Corrosion cracking in a hy-drotreating unit can occur through chloride attack or polythionic acid attack. Chlorideattack can be prevented by minimizing the amount of chloride in the process materialthat will come in contact with the austenitic stainless steel during normal operations. Inaddition, during startup and shutdown operations precautions should be taken to limitthe chloride content in any ﬂushing, purging, or neutralizing agents used in the system.
Polythionic acids occur as the result of the action of water and oxygen on the iron sul-
ﬁde scale that forms on all items made of austenitic stainless steel. Once formed theseacids can attack the austenitic steel and cause intergranular corrosion and cracking. Toprevent polythionic acid attack, it is necessary to maintain the temperature above thedew point of water in those areas containing stainless steel. Under normal operatingconditions, the system is essentially free of oxygen. However, when the system isdepressurized and the equipment is opened to air, it becomes necessary to maintain anitrogen purge to prevent air from entering. In cases where adequate temperatures orpurges cannot be maintained, a protective neutralizing environment should be estab-lished. Generally, a 5% soda solution is used to neutralize the austenitic stainless steel.HYDROTREATING 345
Figure 8.10. Two bed hydrotreating reactor with interbed quench.
Figure 8.10 shows a hydrotreating reactor with two beds of catalyst and one interbed
quench zone is pictured, but the number of beds can vary for different designs. Asalready indicated, most naphtha hydrotreaters only have one catalyst bed. Many re-actors processing cracked feedstocks will have several beds to facilitate temperature346 CHAPTER 8
control by cooling with hydrogen quench between the catalyst beds. For example, a
reactor design could require three catalyst beds and two interbed quench zones.
The reactor vessel is designed to allow maximum utilization of catalyst. Creating equal
ﬂow distribution, providing maximum liquid/vapor mixing, and providing multiplebeds with quench zones for efﬁcient catalyst usage achieve this. The internals of thereactor found in a reactor are the following (though not all reactors necessarily haveall of them).
rInlet diffuser
rTop vapor/liquid distribution tray
rQuench section (present only when there are multiple catalyst beds)
rCatalyst support grid (present only when there are multiple catalyst beds)
rOutlet collector
The size of hydrotreating reactors varies widely depending on the design conditionsand is dependent on the desired mass velocity and acceptable pressure drops. Sinceheat release is a common feature for all hydrotreaters, reactor temperature control hasto be exercised. Generally, the maximum allowable /Delta1Tis 75
◦F (42◦C). If that tem-
perature is not expected to be exceeded, the reactor will be mono bed and temperaturecontrol will be exercised by changing the reactor inlet temperature. If the maximumreactor /Delta1T is expected to exceed 75
◦F (42◦C), a multiple bed reactor should be in-
stalled with cold hydrogen quench inserted in the quench section for temperaturecontrol.
Hydrotreater reactor operationDuring operation, the hydrotreating catalyst gradually loses some of its activity. In
order to maintain the desired quality of the products at the design feed rate, the averagebed temperature is gradually increased. The temperature increase in many cases isvery small, less than 2
◦F/month (1◦C/month). When the average bed temperature
reaches a value close to the design maximum, the catalyst has to be replaced orreactivated. Because the required temperature increase per unit time is relativelysmall, the reactor can be operated with the same catalyst for several years beforeregeneration or replacement of the deactivated catalyst becomes necessary. Quiteoften, catalyst regeneration or replacement is dictated by a high reactor pressure drop,due to catalyst fouling."
"Kinetics is the study of the rates of reaction. The rates of reaction determine the
key properties of a catalyst. In hydrotreating, the key properties are initial activity,stability, and product quality. The temperature required to obtain the desired productat the start of the run measures the initial activity. Catalyst stability is a measure ofchange of reaction rate over time. The product quality is a measure of the ability of theprocess to yield products with the desired use speciﬁcation such as pour point, smokeHYDROTREATING 347

and the chemical basis for these measurements.
Hydrotreating process variables
The proper operation of the unit will depend on the careful selection and control of
the processing conditions. By careful monitoring of these process variables the unitcan operate to its full potential.
Reactor temperature
Reactor temperature should be minimized while maintaining desired product quality.
Increasing reactor temperature will accelerate the rate of coke formation and reducethe length of the operating cycle. The required temperature is dependent upon feed rateand quality. The reactor inlet temperature is most easily and commonly controlled bythe operator to adjust for obtaining the desired product quality. The reactor outlet tem-perature is a function of the feed quality and cannot be easily varied except by changingthe reactor inlet temperature. The inlet temperature must always be controlled at theminimum required to achieve the desired product properties. Temperatures above thisminimum will only lead to higher rates of coke formation and reduced processingperiods. The weight average bed temperature (WABT) is typically used to comparethe relative catalyst activity. The WABT can be calculated as shown in Figure 8.11.
If the reactor only has inlet and outlet thermometry (as is the case in perhaps as
many as 2/3 of hydrotreaters), the WABT represents the average of inlet and outlettemperatures. The rate of increase in this temperature is referred to as the deactivationrate expressed as
◦F per barrel of feed per pound of catalyst (◦C per m3of feed per
kilogram of catalyst), or simply as◦F per day (◦C per day). During the course of an
operating cycle, the temperature required to obtain the desired product quality willincrease as a result of catalyst deactivation. Increasing reactor temperatures up toa limit of about 800
◦F (428◦C) maximum bed temperature can compensate for the
gradual loss in catalyst activity. In general, above this level, coke formation becomesvery rapid and little improvement in performance is obtained.348 CHAPTER 8

The design temperature of the reactor(s) will determine the maximum allowable oper-
ating value. The temperature rise across the reactor(s) must be monitored continuouslyin order to assure that the design limitation of the unit is not exceeded. This can beespecially important when changing feedstocks since oleﬁn saturation results in con-siderably higher heats of reaction. Units are typically designed for a maximum reactorbed temperature rise <60
◦F (33◦C).
Feed quality and rate
The amount of catalyst loaded into the reactors as well as other design parameters
are based on the quantity and quality of feedstock the unit is designed to process.While minor changes in feed type and charge rate can be tolerated, wide variationsshould be avoided since they will tend to reduce the useful life of the catalyst. Anincrease in the charge rate will require higher reactor temperature to achieve a constantdesulfurization (or denitrogenation) as well as higher recycle gas rate to maintain aconstant ratio of H
2to hydrocarbon. The increased reactor temperatures will lead to"
"a faster rate of coke formation that will reduce the cycle length. A reduced feed ratemay lead to bad ﬂow distribution through the catalyst, such that higher temperatureswill be required to obtain good product quality. Its distillation range and API gravitybest indicate the type of feed being processed. An increase in the end point of thefeed will make sulfur and nitrogen removal more difﬁcult, thus requiring higherreactor temperatures which, in turn, accelerate coke formation. Coke deposition isalso accelerated by the fact that heavier feed contains more of the precursors thatfavor coke formation. In addition to the above, high boiling fractions also containincreased quantities of metals which lead not only to higher reactor pressure drop,but to rapid catalyst deactivation as well. A reduction in the API gravity of the feedfor the same boiling range is an indication of higher unsaturates content. This typeof feed will result in increased hydrogen consumption and higher temperature riseHYDROTREATING 349Diesel Cetane Number

across the catalyst bed. It also contains more of the materials that easily condense to
form coke in the reactor and associated equipment.
Hydrogen partial pressure
The hydrogen partial pressure is calculated by multiplying the H 2purity of the recycle
gas times the pressure of the product separator. The hydrogen partial pressure required
for the operation of a unit is chosen based on the degree of sulfur (or nitrogen, oraromatic saturation etc.) removal that must be achieved and is generally an economicoptimum that balances capital cost and operating costs against catalyst life. Hydrogenpartial pressure is also a critical design parameter for achieving the desired degree offeed saturation. Figures 8.12 and 8.13 illustrate the effect of hydrogen partial pressureon the quality of the products. A reduction of the operating pressure below the designlevel will have a negative effect on the activity of the catalyst and will acceleratecatalyst deactivation due to coke formation.
Gas-to-oil ratio
This is an important variable for the satisfactory performance of a hydrotreater. If the
unit is operated at lower than design ratios more rapid catalyst deactivation will result.The circulating gas also provides the heat sink for the removal of the heat of reaction.350 CHAPTER 8Aromatics in Product
Hydrogen partial pressure
Figure 8.13. Effect of pressure on distillate quality.
The gas-to-oil is calculated as follows:
Gas to oil ratio [SCFB] =Total gas to reactors (SCFH or Nm3/h)
Raw oil charge (BPH or m3/h)
Though various hydrotreating unit designers and catalyst manufacturers use different
values, it is generally accepted that the minimum gas to oil ratio should be at least 4times the amount of hydrogen consumption.
Liquid hourly space velocity
The design quantity of catalyst per unit of feed will depend upon feedstock properties,
operating conditions, and product quality required. The liquid hourly space velocity(LHSV) is deﬁned as follows:
LHSV [1/hr] =Charge rate (ft
3/hr or m3/h)
V olume catalyst (ft3or m3)
A simpliﬁed kinetic expression based on sulfur and/or nitrogen removal determinesthe initial liquid hourly space velocity for most feedstocks and processing objectives.This initial value may be modiﬁed due to other considerations such as unit size, ex-tended catalyst cycle life, abnormal levels of feed metals and requirements of otherprocessing units in the reﬁnery ﬂow scheme. A unit design is based on operation toachieve optimum performance. One criterion is liquid mass ﬂux across the catalystbed. At reduced throughput, unit operation may become difﬁcult due to hydraulicHYDROTREATING 351
considerations. Also, liquid distribution in the reactor may become unequal as pref-
erential ﬂow paths are established. For these reasons, the unit should not be oper-ated below the minimum turndown capacity for extended periods. Unit turndownwill vary for each design and is typically 50–70% of design capacity. Operationat too high of space velocity (compared to original design) is not advisable be-cause of increased catalyst deactivation rates as well as increased system pressuredrop.
Recycle gas purity
The effective completion of the hydrogenation reactions occurring over the catalyst
requires that a certain quantity of hydrogen be present at a minimum partial pres-sure. As noted previously, both the quantity (gas-to-oil ratio) and partial pressure aredependent upon the hydrogen content, i.e., purity, of the recycle gas. Practical con-siderations, such as the cost of compression, catalyst life, etc., limit the purity of therecycle gas to a minimum value usually in the range of 70–80 mol%. Lower hydro-gen purities are detrimental to the performance of the unit since higher temperaturesmust be used to achieve the desired product quality. The purity of the recycle gas isdetermined by the following factors:"
"rThe purity of the makeup gas
rThe amounts of light hydrocarbons and H
2S that are allowed to accumulate in the
recycle gas.
In most instances, the makeup gas H 2purity cannot be easily manipulated since it
is ﬁxed by the operation of the Reformer or the Hydrogen manufacturing plant. Thelight hydrocarbons present in the recycle gas enter the system with the makeup gasin addition to those being formed in the reactor, and must be vented from the high-pressure separator to prevent their accumulation in the recycle gas. The amount ofhydrogen required is determined by:
(a) Chemical hydrogen consumption—The hydrogen consumed during the hy-
drotreating reactions
(b) Solution losses —The hydrogen that is removed from the reactor circuit dissolved
in the liquid hydrocarbon leaving the high-pressure separator
(c) Mechanical losses—The hydrogen lost through the makeup and recycle gas com-
pressors’ packing vents and seals. This value may be roughly estimated at 3–5%of the combined chemical consumption plus solution losses
(d) Venting losses—The hydrogen lost in the purge stream from the high-pressure
separator to maintain recycle gas purity
The H
2S formed in the reactors can reach equilibrium values as high as 5 mol% in the
recycle gas. This concentration of H 2S has a depressing effect on the activity of the352 CHAPTER 8
catalyst. Therefore, in many cases it is desirable to remove the H 2S from the recycle
gas. The removal of H 2S is performed in a scrubber where the recycle gas in contacted
with an amine (generally MEA or DEA) solution. In this manner, the H 2S content of
the recycle gas can be reduced to the parts per million range.
Another method to increase hydrogen purity is membrane separation. This system
removes the hydrogen from the vent gas and recycles it back with the makeup hydro-gen.
Catalyst contaminantsTemporary
Process variables inﬂuence catalyst life by affecting the rate of carbon deposition onthe catalyst. There is a moderate accumulation of carbon on the catalyst during theinitial days of operation. The rate of increase will be reduced to very low levels undernormal processing conditions. A carbon level of 5 wt% may be tolerated without asigniﬁcant decrease in desulfurization. However, denitrogenation activity would bereduced.
The sulfur and nitrogen found in the feed could be considered contaminants to the
extent that they produce hydrogen sulﬁde and ammonia which can react to formammonium bisulﬁde. The water injected into the reactor efﬂuent dissolves the am-monium bisulﬁde and prevents exchanger fouling. Organic nitrogen in the feed, ifpresent in amounts higher than expected, will require higher reactor temperatures forprocessing, and will lead to a reduction in catalyst life.
If the water injection should be stopped for any period of time, the H
2S and NH 3
may accumulate in the recycle gas and result in a sudden loss in catalyst activity.
The activity will return to normal once wash water is reestablished. Catalyst bedtemperatures should not be increased to compensate for the temporary activity loss.
Small amounts of molecular nitrogen, CO and CO
2that enter the system with the
makeup gas are not harmful to the catalyst, but must be vented to prevent accumulation
in the recycle gas. Excessive amounts of CO and CO 2may have an adverse effect
on catalyst performance, as they may be methanated by the catalyst taking up activesites and liberating heat. This will raise the outlet temperature and reduce the apparentcatalyst activity. The unit should never be pressured up with high CO +CO
2containing
makeup gas as a temperature runaway may result.
Permanent
Permanent loss of catalyst activity is usually caused by the gradual accumulationof inorganic species picked up from the feed, makeup hydrogen or efﬂuent washwater. Examples include arsenic, lead, calcium, sodium, silicon, and phosphorus. LowHYDROTREATING 353
concentrations of these elements (and other alkaline metals) can cause deactivation
over time as they are deposited on the catalyst.
Organic metal compounds are decomposed and typically deposit in the upper section
of the catalyst bed as a metal sulﬁde. The graded catalyst bed, if used, may containdemetallization catalysts that have a high metals retention capacity. Some of thesecatalysts may retain as much as 100 wt% of the fresh catalyst weight as metals from thefeed. These demetallization catalysts typically have a lower activity for desulfurizationand denitrogenation.
Hydrotreating catalysts exhibit a moderate tolerance for metals such as arsenic and
lead. Total metal content of 2–3 wt% of the hydrotreating catalyst have been observed.However, product analysis frequency should be increased to monitor breakthroughwhen calculations show the metals level on the hydrotreating catalyst exceeds 0.5wt%. Metals cannot be removed by catalyst regeneration. Catalyst replacement shouldbe considered when metal loading of 1–2 wt% is exceeded on the hydrotreatingcatalyst."
"Apparent catalyst deactivation may be caused by the accumulation of deposits on
top of the catalyst bed. Solid material, such as corrosion products and coke, willlead to rapid fouling of the catalyst bed if allowed to enter the reactor. This problemis remedied by skimming a portion of the catalyst, screening, and reloading. Feedﬁltering is quite effective in removing solid material, and as such results in longeroperating cycles due to the lower rate of reactor pressure drop build-up. The use offeed ﬁltering will depend on the type of feed processed and its source.
Hydrotreaters licensors and catalyst manufacturers
LicensorsUntil the 1970s all the types of hydrotreating were offered as licensed processes by
several major licensors. Since that time, more and more of the types of hydrotreatinghave been offered without a license and the catalyst used in the process was soldas a commodity. Today, Chevron, IFP and UOP offer only residue hydrotreating asa licensed process. A few specialized types of hydrotreating such as some aromaticsaturation units are also offered as licensed units, however, the vast majority of new hy-drotreaters are sold without a license. Engineering contractors do most of the designs.
Catalyst suppliersThrough the years there have been many manufacturers of hydrotreating catalysts.
Other manufacturers have absorbed some, some have changed names, and some354 CHAPTER 8
have discontinued hydrotreating catalyst manufacturing. Some suppliers simply sell
catalyst they have re-branded with their name.

Gasoline components
9.1 Motor fuel alkylation
James F . Himes and Robert L. Mehlberg*
9.1.1 Introduction
Motor fuel alkylation in the petroleum reﬁning industry refers to the acid catalyzed
conversion of C 3-C5oleﬁns with isobutane into highly branched C 5-C12isoparafﬁns
collectively called alkylate, a valuable gasoline blending component. A major con-stituent of alkylate is 2,2,4-trimethyl pentane which is deﬁned as 100 on the octanescale.
Alkylation reactions are catalyzed by liquid and solid acids, including H
2SO4, AlCl 3-
HCl, HF , HF-BF 3,H2SO4-HSO 3F (Fluorosulfuric acid), Triﬂuoromethane sulfonic
acid chlorided Pt alumina, BF 3on alumina, zeolites, and ion exchange resins. How-
ever, the catalysts and associated processes commercialized during WWII for aviation
gasoline, HF alkylation, and sulfuric acid alkylation, are the focus of this section asthese remain the primary commercial motor fuel alkylation processes. A solid catalystalkylation process (UOP Alkylene™) has been developed and is being offered to theindustry.
History
In 1932–6, alkylation was independently discovered by UOP ,
1Shell, the Anglo Iranian
Oil Company (AIOC), and Texaco whose ﬁrst publications issue in that order. Herman
Pines told the story of UOP’ s discovery of the alkylation of ethylene by pentanes in1932.
2At that time leading universities taught that isoparafﬁns were inert except at
high temperatures and pressures. After ﬁnding anomalies in an oleﬁn assay basedupon H
2SO4extraction Pines and his mentor V . I. Ipatieff hypothesized that parafﬁns
may not be inert to acids. Despite ridicule, they tested that hypothesis by bubblingethylene into chilled pentanes over AlCl

hydrocarbons. Over the next few years they tested AlCl 3-HCl, H 2SO4, HF , and HF-
BF3as alkylation catalysts.
Alkylate was found to have excellent aviation gasoline properties. It was the highest
octane fuel component then known, with high motor octane and excellent lead re-sponse. All of the properties derive from the highly-branched parafﬁns that form itscomposition.
Humble Oil built the ﬁrst commercial H
2SO4alkylation unit in 1938 at Baytown,
Texas.3Alkylation for aviation gasoline grew rapidly with the Allies war effort. In
1939, six petroleum companies formed a consortium to pool their alkylation tech-
nology and develop both sulfuric acid and HF acid processes for 100 octane aviationfuel. The ﬁrst commercial HF alkylation unit started up in 1942. During the war 60alkylation units were built for the Allies’ war effort. Half were built with sulfuric acidas the catalyst and half with HF .
Following World War II, most alkylation operations were discontinued although a few
reﬁners continued to use the process for aviation and premium automobile gasolines.
In the mid-1950s, use of higher performance automotive engines required the reﬁning"
"industry to both increase gasoline production and quality. The development of catalyticreforming, such as UOP Platforming™, provided reﬁners with an important reﬁningtool for production of high octane gasolines. However, the motor fuel produced insuch operations, called reformate, is highly aromatic with a higher sensitivity (thespread between research and motor octane) and a lower lead response than alkylate.Many reﬁners expanded their alkylation operations and began to broaden the rangeof oleﬁn feeds to both existing and new alkylation units to include propylene andoccasionally even some pentenes along with the butenes.
With the phase-out of leaded gasolines and the advent of environmental gasolines the
lead response of alkylate is no longer valued, but the importance of alkylate and itsproduction have both grown because of its other properties. Its high unleaded motoroctane, low volatility, low-sulfur, and nearly zero oleﬁns and aromatics make alkylatecritical to the production of quality environmental gasolines. Alkylate can reach 60%of low-sulfur reformulated premium.
Licensors of motor fuel HF Alkylation processes are UOP LLC and Phillips. Licensors
of H
2SO4alkylation processes are Exxon Mobil and Stratco Engineering.
Process chemistry
The reactions taking place in the alkylation reactor are many and relatively complex.
First the oleﬁn reacts with the acid to form an ester; then the ester is alkylated by aGASOLINE COMPONENTS 357

below.
Primary alkylation reactions
Most of the alkylate product is made by primary alkylation reactions. In these reactionsone mole of oleﬁn reacts with one mole of isobutane to form an isoparafﬁn exactly4 carbon numbers heavier. Example primary alkylation reactions, showing only thecarbon framework and one or two of the principal product isomers, are shown foreach of the principal feed oleﬁns in equations (1.1)–(1.5).

Isomerization
In addition to the listed reactions the acids catalyze isomerization of oleﬁns or theiresters before alkylation as well as isomerization of the alkylate products. Most of theproduct isomerizations are methyl shifts of ionic intermediates.
rReaction selectivites—The selectivities of these reactions depend upon the feed-stock, catalyst, and reaction conditions.
rIsobutylene and isopentenes are very reactive and are prone to polymerization toheavy alkylate (reaction (2.2)) and to conjunct polymer (reaction (2.5)), especiallywhen catalyzed by H
2SO4.
rPropylene is less reactive and tends to make more conjunct polymer, especially forthe H
2SO4catalyst.
rButene-1 makes higher yields of low-octane dimethyl hexanes (reaction (1.2)) thanbutene-2 in HF , but there is little difference in these oleﬁns in H
2SO4. To maximize"
"octane many reﬁners have added selective hydrogenation units (such as UOP-HulsSHP™) upstream of the alkylation unit to saturate dioleﬁns reducing the amountof conjunct polymers as well as isomerizing most of the Butene-1 to Butene-2.
rHF enhances hydride transfer reactions (2.1) much more than H
2SO4. These re-
actions increase alkylate yield, RVP , and octane. As a result, HF catalyzes higheryields of isopentane from pentenes than H
2SO4; it also produces low amounts of
n-parafﬁns from n-oleﬁns while H 2SO4produces none. The additional yield of
hydride transfer reactions naturally comes with increased isobutane consumption.360 CHAPTER 9

rH2SO4produces more heavy ends (reaction 2.2) and more conjunct polymer (reac-
tion 2.5) and less isopentane than HF , especially from iso-oleﬁns and propylene. For
all oleﬁns it produces lower yields, higher endpoints, and consumes less isobutane.
rIncreasing reactor temperature increases cracking and conjunct polymer formationat the expense of primary alkylation lowering product octane and increasing RVPand acid consumption.
rIncreasing isobutane concentration increases primary alkylation and hydride trans-fer reactions while reducing polymer formation, cracking, and competition whichincrease yield and octane and reduce acid consumption.

Reaction
After pretreatment, the oleﬁn feeds are combined with a large excess of recycle isobu-tane to provide an 6–14 isobutane:oleﬁn molar ratio and injected into the circulatingHF acid catalyst at the shell side inlet to the water-cooled reactor. Cooling waterﬂows through the reactor tubes to remove the highly exothermic heat of reactionand to maintain reaction conditions at 80–100
◦F . The alkylation reaction is very fast
with 100% oleﬁn conversion. The excess isobutane, alkylate product, non-reactivehydrocarbons (propane, n-butane) in the feeds and the acid catalyst pass on to the set-tler vessel. The dense acid phase separates from the hydrocarbons rapidly by gravityand is then pumped back to the reactor. The hydrocarbons containing dissolved HFﬂow off the top of the settler to the isostripper.
Fractionation
It consists of an isostripper, a depropanizer, and an HF Stripper. The isostripper isa large tower with two sidedraws with the primary function recycling isobutane tosupport the high isobutane:oleﬁn molar ratio of the reactor. The tower typically hastwo reboilers; the upper reboiler typically maximizes the use of relatively low cost lowor medium pressure steam and the lower reboiler uses a heating medium that can give400–450
◦F process temperatures. Alkylate is drawn off the bottom of the tower, cooled
in exchangers, and sent to product storage. The next product draw up the tower is then-butane sidedraw and above that is the isobutane recycle draw. On most UOP units theisobutane draw is located below the feed tray to minimize HF in the isobutane recycle.362 CHAPTER 9
The isostripper overhead vapor is a propane-enriched isobutane stream and HF which
is condensed and separated into settling drum. The HF phase is pumped back to thereactor section. The HF saturated hydrocarbon phase is charged to the depropanizer.
The depropanizer and its associated HF stripper remove propane from the isobutane
recycle. The depropanizer bottoms is returned to the reactors as part of the recy-cle isobutane. The depropanizer overhead containing the propane product and HFare condensed and separated in the overhead receiver. The acid phase is returned tothe reactor section and the acid-saturated propane is stripped free of acid in the HFStripper column. The HF stripper bottoms is an acid-free propane product which istreated with hot alumina to remove organic ﬂuorides, cooled and treated with KOHpellets to remove traces of HF and water.
Acid regeneration"
"A key advantage of HF alkylation over sulfuric is the ability to recover the acid fromthe byproduct polymer, water, and other contaminants. In the UOP HF AlkylationProcess, a small stream of circulating acid is stripped with superheated isobutane ina small monel tower called the Acid Regenerator. The regenerator overhead is HFand isobutane that are recycled to the reactor; the regenerator bottoms is polymer andthe HF–water azeotrope which are neutralized with aqueous KOH. The neutralizedpolymer has good fuel value. The amount of polymer produced is generally only 1 to2 barrels per 1,000 barrels of alkylate product.
KOH regeneration
The UOP process minimizes chemical costs by regenerating the KOH used to treatproducts and all waste and storm water. This KOH regeneration is accomplished usinglime. As the lime is mixed into the KOH, regeneration of the KOH takes place by thefollowing reaction:
2KF+Ca(OH)
2→2KOH +CaF 2
The calcium ﬂuoride forms a precipitate and can be easily separated from the regen-erated KOH.
Process variables in HF alkylation
Key variables are reactor temperature, isobutane to oleﬁn molar ratio, acid strength,and acid to hydrocarbon volume ratio.
Reaction temperature is one of the more important process variables as it has a
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the octane number of the product. Almost all HF alkylationreactors are operated below 100
◦F . At higher temperatures a decrease in alkylate
octane number will occur. Above 120◦F polymerization and cracking side reactions
become excessive reducing alkylate quality. In many cases, acid regeneration capacityof the HF alkylation unit would not be able to maintain proper control of the acidstrength at temperatures above 110
◦F . Extremely low reaction temperatures may cause
incomplete alkylation. Thus reaction temperatures below 80◦F are typically not used.GASOLINE COMPONENTS 363
Isobutane to oleﬁn molar ratio is generally the most important variable that the reﬁner
has the most control over within limitations of isostripper fractionation loadings. Asthe isobutane to oleﬁn molar ratio is increased, octane increases; thus the ﬂow ofisobutane recycle is usually kept at a practical maximum at all times, up to the capac-ity of the isostripper. The reasons to reduce the recycle ratio are for the conservationof fractionation energy or for a reduction in the hydride transfer reaction. The higherenergy consumption, the greater consumption of isobutane (due to the hydride trans-fer) and the increased production of propane (due to the hydride transfer) must bejustiﬁed economically against higher product quality. Another practical limitation ofisobutane circulation is possible entrainment of acid from the reactor section acidsettler to the isostripper because of inadequate settling time.
Acid strength is usually kept between 85 and 95 mass% HF . Maintenance of this
strength level results from a balance between the performance of the unit feed treatingsystems for sulfur and water removal and acid regeneration operation. In some casesoxygenate removal systems or diene removal systems are also used on the feed wherethere are known to be high oxygenates (such as downstream of an MTBE unit, orhigh dioleﬁns (from severe FCC conditions). The action of the acid on reactions is acomplex phenomenon and is dependent on the type as well as the amount of diluents.The fresh acid is supplied by acid manufacturers at 99.0
+wt% HF . This purity is too
high for optimum performance of the HF alkylation process. As the water contentof the circulating acid increases, carbon steel that is not attacked by anhydrous HF ,becomes less resistant to acid attack.
The acid to hydrocarbon volume ratio used in the reactor of the UOP process is
generally around 1:1. At some point below 0.8–1, excess polymerization occurs. Inthe most extreme cases, alkylate production could stop.
Two other variable related topics are reaction time and pressure. As the reaction time
decreases, the combined ﬂuorides leaving the reactor section will increase. However,any reduction in time is limited by the settling capacity and there is generally littleeffect within the permissable operating ranges of a particular unit. Excessive velocitiesin the settler will cause free (above saturation level) acid to be carried over into theisostripper. This carryover may result in corrosion of the upper trays of the isostripperand discolored alkylate as heavier contaminants in the acid that is carried over dropinto the alkylate product. Pressure is not really a process variable as long as it is kepthigh enough that all of the hydrocarbon and acid in the reactor section remain in theliquid state.
HF feed contaminants"
"As with many reﬁning processes, the control of contaminants coming into the unit withthe normal feedstocks is critical to the long and dependable operation of the HF alky-lation unit. Above the recommended maximum levels of feed stock contaminants, acidconsumption, acid regeneration requirements, and in some cases unit corrosion and364 CHAPTER 9
product quality are all measurably affected. Generally all contaminants are kept as
low as possible within the capabilities of the feed treating systems. The major feedcontaminants normally found in alkylation feeds are water or oxygenates, sulfur com-pounds, nitrogen compounds, non-condensibles, and dioleﬁn.
HF alkylation maintenance
Because HF is highly corrosive to most materials, careful control and maintenance ofequipment metallurgy and condition is required. Carbon steel is the primary materialused for vessels and piping and it can be used only because of a corrosion barrier layerof iron ﬂuoride that forms on any carbon steel surface exposed to HF . The iron ﬂuoridelayer is tenacious and serves as a barrier against further carbon steel corrosion aslong as the deposit remains undisturbed. Under certain conditions, such as when wetacid is in the unit, this iron ﬂuoride scale can soften and break off leading to foulingand corrosion issues. In severe cases this can lead to considerable unscheduled feedoutages as well as clear safety issues. Most reﬁners aggressively monitor their equip-ment’ s remaining corrosion allowance and use regularly scheduled valve and ﬂangereplacement to head off any problems. For maintenance during an FCC turnaround,the normal time most alkylation turnarounds are maintained, many reﬁners chooseto dissolve all the iron ﬂuoride scale by using a chemical cleaning company.
There are other areas within an alkylation unit where conditions are too severe for
carbon steel and monel is the primary metallurgy for such areas as monel has goodresistance even for high water content HF . Temperature is also an important variablefor corrosion rate of both carbon steel and at higher temperatures for monel. Anotheruse of monel is for moving parts where use of carbon steel would cause cementing ofparts together a iron ﬂuoride scale formed on each steel surface.
Sulfuric acid alkylation
Today there are two processes for H
2SO4alkylation the Cascade process licensed by
Exxon Mobil and MW Kellogg and the Stratco efﬂuent refrigerated process.Figure 9.1.3 shows the cascade alkylation process.
Feed pretreatment
It usually consists of deethanizing and Merox-treating of FCC oleﬁns. Some reﬁnershave added selective hydrogenation units (SHP) to saturate dienes and reduce acidconsumption. Feeds are generally not dried.
Reaction
The FCC oleﬁns are chilled and coalesced to remove water and injected throughsparge rings to 3–6 agitated reaction zones in a large horizontal reactor/settler vessel.Recycle isobutane from the deisobutanizer and the refrigeration system and recycleacid from the settler are fed to a pre-ﬂash zone and “cascade” from one zone throughGASOLINE COMPONENTS 365

specially designed weirs from which the process name derives. Typical isobutane
oleﬁn ratios are 8–12 for the process. The ﬁrst zone in the cascade reactor has thelowest operating temperature and the highest isobutane concentration and producesthe highest octane alkylate. As additional oleﬁn is injected in subsequent zones thetemperature increases and isobutane concentration decreases and successively loweroctanes are produced. Because isobutane and H
2SO4are highly immiscible, each
zone requires a mixer with high power inputs to produce a tight emulsion. Afterthe ﬁnal reaction zone the emulsion is allowed to settle. The settler acid phase ispumped back to the lead zone and the hydrocarbon phase efﬂuent is pumped to efﬂuenttreating.
Refrigeration
The heat of reaction is removed by “auto-refrigeration” at reaction temperatures of35–65
◦F . While refrigeration is often viewed as costly, in this process it conserves the
heat of reaction to distill 4–5 moles of isobutane recycle per mole of oleﬁn alkylatedand concentrates propane. Isobutane and propane vaporized from the reactor arecompressed, and condensed with cooling water and recycled as “refrigerant” to thereactors. A fraction of the refrigerant is charged to the depropanizer to remove propanecontained in the feeds from the unit.
Efﬂuent treating
The hydrocarbon efﬂuent containing alkylate and excess isobutane is warmed bychilling recycle isobutane and feed and treated to remove traces of entrained acid and366 CHAPTER 9
ester reaction intermediates. Treating systems include washing with fresh acid and"
"aqueous caustic (as shown). Caustic and water washes, bauxite, and KOH pellets havealso been used.
Fractionation
After efﬂuent treating the balance of reactor isobutane requirement is distilled fromthe Alkylate and n-butane deisobutanizer tower (DIB). Most reﬁners charge saturatedbutanes from other units to the DIB for isobutane/n-butane splitting. N-butane isdistilled from the Alkylate for control of product RVP in a debutanizer, and in somecases an n-butane vapor draw from the DIB. Finally, in a few units, aviation alkylateis produced by removing heavy ends in a Rerun column.
Stratco effluent refrigerated alkylation process
In the Stratco process (Figure 9.1.4.), the principal differences from the Cascade
process are in the reactor and refrigeration design and that the reaction is carried outwithout vaporization.

refrigeration and recycle acid from the settler are emulsiﬁed together by the high
power impeller of the Stratco Contactor. After reaction and chilling the emulsionpasses to the settler located above the contactors for acid separation. The acid phaseis recycled by gravity to the contactor impeller. And the hydrocarbon phase (efﬂuent)routed in the tube-side of the contactor heat exchanger.
Refrigeration
The heat of reaction is removed by chilling the emulsion in shell side of the contactorheat exchanger by partially vaporizing settler efﬂuent on the tube side. Refrigerantvapor is separated from the efﬂuent liquid in a ﬂash drum, compressed, and condensed.A portion of the condensed refrigerant is routed to a depropanizer. The balanceof the refrigeration and depropanizer bottoms are ﬂash cooled and returned to thereactors.
Efﬂuent treating and fractionation
These steps are essentially the same as in the Cascade process.
Process variable in H
2SO4alkylation
Temperature
Maximum octanes for butenes and pentenes are obtained at about 35–40◦F and for
propylene at about 50◦F . Typically, octane decreases at about 0.04–0.06 octanes per
◦F at higher temperatures.
Isobutane concentrationReaction selectivity and octane increase with isobutane concentration. Typical re-sponses are about 0.1 octane per 1 vol% isobutane in efﬂuent.
Acid strength
Octane is maximized at about 93 wt% acidity. It declines at about 0.2–0.3 RON per1% acidity decline below that. The economics of acid cost usually require lower ﬁnalspending strengths (as low as 88 wt%), so multi-reactor alkylation units typicallyfeed fresh acid to several reactors in parallel operating at 93% then reuse the 93% asmakeup to other reactors in series.
Space velocity
Octane decreases with the charge rate of oleﬁn. Alkylation reactors are typicallydesigned at 0.15–0.30. LHSV deﬁned as the volume of oleﬁn charged per hour pervolume of acid. Operations at much higher throughputs are possible but low octanesand high acid consumption generally result.368 CHAPTER 9
Acid fraction
Octane increases with acid fraction and peaks at about 60 vol% acid in emulsion.
Power per unit volume
Octane depends upon the mass transfer rate of isobutane from the hydrocarbon phaseinto the acid phase. According to Sprow
5reaction selectivity and octane increase with
interfacial area which depends upon power per unit volume to the 0.25 power.
Sulfuric acid consumption and regeneration
Sulfuric acid alkylation uses about 100 times as much acid as HF alkylation because
H2SO4cannot be stripped from the conjunct polymer, water, and contaminants. Sul-
furic acid is typically spent at 88–91 wt% H 2SO4, below which it is too weak to carry
out alkylation. The spent acid is not a waste. It is regenerated by burning the organicswhich reduces the H
2SO4to SO 2and water vapor. The SO 2is then dried and oxidized
to SO 3and scrubbed with water to produce 98.5–99.5% H 2SO4.
For sulfuric alkylation, aside from the direct hazards of contacting the acid, there aretransportation safety issues around the need to ship and regenerate 20–500 tons ofH
2SO4daily. Several reﬁners have built dedicated acid plants to regenerate spent acid
from the alkylation unit or pipelines to and from an acid manufacturer.
Acid consumption is generally expressed as the pounds of acid diluted from 99%"
"to 90% by conjunct polymer, water, and other contaminants per gallon or barrel ofalkylate. Consumption can be as low as 16 lbs per barrel alkylate for diene-free,MTBE rafﬁnates run at ideal process conditions. Acid consumption can exceed 40 lb/bbl of alkylate when running high levels of isobutylene, pentenes, and propylene athigh temperatures.
H
2SO4contaminants
DienesButadiene and pentadienes are a major contaminants affecting acid consumption. Di-enes and can account for 10–30% of the acid consumed. Dienes can dilute 5–20 lbsof 99% acid down to 90% per lb of diene. Some reﬁners use dioleﬁn selective hydro-genation units (such as UOP-Huls SHP™) to eliminate this source of acid consump-tion.
Water and oxygenates
Water can also account for 10–20% of acid consumption. Wet feeds, wet isobutanerecycle, and high reactor temperatures are the main sources. Oxygenates includingacetone from the FCC, methanol and dimethyl ether from MTBE and TAME unitsalso consume acid. Water and oxygenates dilute 10 lbs of 99% acid to 90 per lb ofcontaminant.GASOLINE COMPONENTS 369
Sulfur and nitrogen compounds
Dilute about 20 lbs of 99% acid to 90% per lb of sulfur or nitrogen.
C6+
Dilutes 2 lbs of 99% acid to 90% per lb of contaminant. This can be a signiﬁcantcontributor to acid consumption when alkylating pentenes.
Ethylene
Dilutes 20 lbs of 99% acid to 90% per lb of contaminant by forming stable sulfatesthat stay in the acid.
Ethane and lighter
While inert, light ends increase compressor discharge pressure for total condensation.These indirectly increase acid consumption when limited by horsepower by increasingreactor temperature.

Alkylate properties
Table 9.1.1 illustrates typical product properties for alkylate from HF and H 2SO4
alkylation units for propylene-butylene and butylene only units. Alkylate is composed
of primarily C 7’ s and C 8parafﬁns with a relatively narrow boiling range. Motor fuel
alkylate has desirable T50 and T90 distillation properties in addition to the longrecognized low endpoint. RON is in the mid to low 90s and MON is 1–2 unitslower. Its high MON is an important property of alkylates. The reid vapor pressure ofdebutanized alkylate can be as low as 5–6 PSIA except when alkylating pentenes. Itslow RVP and very low sulfur and the absence of oleﬁns and aromatics make alkylatea valuable component of reformulated gasolines by reducing Evaporative, NO
xand
toxics emissions. These properties (or rather lack thereof) cause alkylate to trade ata premium over its already high octane value.
Almost all recently designed new alkylation units have been butylenes only or butylene
with some portion of the pentenes. In most cases for butylene only units, the feedstockis pretreated in a selective hydrogenation unit to both remove the dioleﬁns whichincrease acid passivation tar precursors and for HF alkylation units to isomerize mostof the low octane producing 1-butene to the more desirable 2-butene isomers. Such apretreating unit can raise the octane of HF alkylate product by one 1 Road ON as canalso be seen in the third column of Table 9.1.1.
Recent developments
Motor fuel alkylation has recently received a boost from the planned phase-out of
MTBE in gasoline blending formulations. Without MTBE, the best conventionalcomponents for today’ s reformulated gasolines are high octane parafﬁnic componentslike alkylate.
While environmental legislation has increased demand for alkylate, its catalysts
H
2SO4and HF came under intense environmental scrutiny in recent years. While
both acids are corrosive and toxic, HF is especially hazardous since it has the po-tential to form toxic aerosols, which can travel signiﬁcant distances downwind of anaccidental release. This scrutiny challenged the petroleum industry to enhance safetyand even to seek new alkylation catalysts.
rUOP-Texaco and Mobil-Phillips developed cosolvents called Alkad™ and Re-vap™, respectively, to reduce HF aerosoling.
rA consortium of reﬁners and HF manufacturers lead by Amoco developed HFdispersion models and water spray mitigation with extensive, large-scale testing todesign of release control systems. Together, cosolvents and water spray mitigationcan reduce downwind HF concentrations by over 95% should a release occur.GASOLINE COMPONENTS 371
rThrough the American Petroleum Institute, the industry developed a comprehensive"
"document for safe operation of HF alkylation units entitled ‘Recommended Practicefor Safe Operation of Hydroﬂuoric Acid Alkylation Units’, API RecommendedPractice 751, ﬁrst published in June, 1992 and reissued in February, 1999.
rFinally the efforts to ﬁnd new catalysts for alkylation have yielded solid cata-lyst processes such as UOP’ s Alkylene™ process that are ready for commerciali-zation.
Conclusions
Motor fuel alkylation using liquid hydroﬂuoric or sulfuric acids is one of the oldest
catalytic processes used in reﬁning and petrochemical operations. The liquid acidprocesses remain important despite concerns with safety and environmental propertiesof the liquid acids. Solid catalyst alkylation using processes such as Alkylene™ (UOPLLC) are emerging technology.

Introduction
Catalytic oleﬁn condensation refers in general to the reaction of one molecule of an
oleﬁn with one or more molecules of the same oleﬁn or of other oleﬁns to yield heavieroleﬁnic compounds. The term “condensation” reﬂects the fact that liquid productsare obtained from gaseous oleﬁns.
Oleﬁn condensation is in some ways similar to motor fuel alkylation, except that in
alkylation we react an oleﬁn with an isoparafﬁn to yield a parafﬁnic compound. Inoleﬁn condensation, on the other hand, the products that are made are oleﬁnic, butmay be later hydrogenated in order to meet the requirements and speciﬁcations of theend products.
Oleﬁn condensation can be carried out in many ways and over a diversity of catalysts.
The common characteristic is that oleﬁn condensation takes place over acid catalysts.These catalysts may be solid phosphoric acid (SPA), liquid acids, organometalliccatalysts, zeolites, sulfonic acid resins, etc.
Although oleﬁn condensation ﬁnds broad application in the petroleum reﬁnery en-
vironment, it is also extensively used in petrochemical applications (often combinedwith reﬁnery operations) as, for instance, in the production of heptenes, nonenes,dodecenes, etc. often used for the production of alkylaromatic derivatives. In fact,some of the same catalysts (e.g., SPA) can also be used for the alkylation of oleﬁnswith aromatics as in the production of cumene (isopropyl-benzene), ethylbenzene,etc. This review will concentrate on reﬁnery and oleﬁn oligomer applications andwill not discuss aromatic alkylation applications.

History
The discovery of acid catalysis, and in particular the development of solid phosphoric
acid (SPA) catalysts, is attributed to the pioneering work of Vladimir Ipatieff atwhat was then called Universal Oil Products and is today known as UOP . The ﬁrstcommercial unit for the production of octenes by the dimerization of butenes cameon-stream in 1935. By introducing this new ingredient in the formulation of gasolines,it greatly contributed to the popularization of the automobile that had hitherto beenconstrained by the limited availability of straight-run gasolines from the fractionationof petroleum crudes. In addition, the octenes obtained by butene dimerization had ahigher octane number than naturally occurring straight-run gasolines. Several hundredunits were soon built to satisfy the growing demand for gasoline. Commercially,the dimerization and oligomerization of oleﬁns over SPA catalysts is known as theCatalytic Condensation process. This is still the dominant process for the dimerizationand oligomerization of oleﬁns. It is only recently that more work has been done onthe development of acid zeolite catalysts and, in some cases, of sulfonic acid resincatalysts.
The other type of catalysts most often found in reﬁnery applications for the produc-
tion of gasoline components are organometallic catalysts developed by the InstituteFran¸ cais du P´ etrole (IFP) and used, for example, in the dimerization of propyleneto isohexenes (Dimersol G process), or in the oligomerization of light oleﬁns fromcracked gases (Dimersol E), or in the production of heptenes and octenes from propy-lene and/or butenes (Dimersol X).
Because the production of oleﬁn dimers and oligomers almost invariably produces a"
"blend of isomers and often also a lighter and a heavier fraction, the production of theseoleﬁns for petrochemical applications cannot be easily segregated from their appli-cation in gasoline and diesel fuel uses. However, it is usually the case that catalystscan be tailored within certain limits so as to yield more branched compounds (higheroctane) for gasoline applications and less branched products for petrochemical appli-cations. Because the products from such processes always have some branching, thequality of the products in the diesel range is somewhat poor (low cetane numbers)and their use in diesel applications is not that extensive.

The catalytic condensation process was developed in the early 1930s as a means to
convert light gases produced by thermal cracking and thermal reforming into usefulproducts. In the early years of the 20th century, most operations in the petroleumreﬁning industry were limited to the distillation of crude oils into gasoline boiling374 CHAPTER 9
range materials (straight-run gasolines), kerosenes, and lamp fuels. The yields in the
gasoline fraction were low (sometimes as low as 5%, depending on the crude) anddid not meet the requirements of the growing automobile industry.
One of the early ways to increase gasoline yields was by thermal cracking. The
dominant thermal cracking technology was the Dubbs Process. In fact, out of the de-velopment of the Dubbs Process emerged the Universal Oil Products company (nowUOP). A by-product from the Dubbs Process was a light gas stream that containedsaturated and oleﬁnic components that ranged from methane to butenes. Althoughthere was no immediate use for those gases, reﬁners knew that by circulating thesegases through a strong mineral acid it was possible to condense the oleﬁns into heav-ier liquid products, and actually this was the principle applied in the Orsat apparatusused to measure the oleﬁn content of those gases. Use of strong mineral acids (e.g.,sulfuric acid) poses signiﬁcant corrosion problems and presents considerable opera-tional difﬁculties. Ideally, it was desired to operate with a single carbon steel vesselin which the strong acid could be contained. R. E. Schaad and V . N. Ipatieff dis-covered that phosphoric acid mixed with kieselguhr (an abundant naturally occurringsiliceous diatomite mineral) solidiﬁed upon heating. When the solid mass was cooled,broken up, and placed inside a reactor, the propylene and/or butenes condensed intoa liquid in the gasoline boiling range. This discovery was scaled up and eventuallycommercialized (1).
Shortly after the introduction of the Catalytic Condensation process came the catalytic
cracking process, initially as a ﬁxed process and later as the ﬂuidized-bed catalyticcracking process, or FCC. These catalytic cracking processes, and in particular FCC,yielded even more oleﬁns than thermal cracking, principally propylene and butenes,which at that time had very little commercial value. Thus, further application of theCatalytic Condensation process ensued.
The early operations were, by today’ s standards, primitive. To manufacture the catalyst,
phosphoric acid and kieselguhr were mixed together, formed into a cake that washeated and then cooled, and broken up with a sledge hammer. The pieces were screenedinto the proper size range and loaded into the reactor. The reactor operated at verylow pressures and produced such amounts of carbon that the catalyst had to be burntoff every other week, and be completely replaced every four to ﬁve weeks. Thetechnology evolved by ﬁrst improving the catalyst both in terms of manufacture (e.g.,by producing an extrudate) and of formulation and also by optimizing the operatingconditions.
Early units operated at about 10 atmospheres, since that was the pressure level of many
liqueﬁed petroleum gas (LPG) recovery systems. However, it was soon discoveredthat, if the reactor was operated at 30 or more atmospheres, catalyst lives could beextended by a factor of four to six times. Thus, began the evolution of higher pressureGASOLINE COMPONENTS 375
units. Some units that employed tubular reactors at 60 atmospheres were constructed
and were found to be even more successful.
SPA catalyst was also tried for other reactions. In the late 1930s, it was discovered"
"that SPA would catalyze the reaction of oleﬁns with aromatic compounds to yieldmono-oleﬁnic alkyl aromatics. This fortunate discovery was widely used to makecumene (isopropyl-benzene) for aviation fuel used in World War II. Cumene has avery high performance number necessary for the aviation gasoline used in internalcombustion engines in aircraft. After the war, use of cumene in aviation fuel declined,but cumene found an even more important outlet as feedstock for the productionof phenol and acetone—to this date, this petrochemical use of cumene continuesto dominate this industry, even though in recent years there has been a signiﬁcantshift from SPA to acid zeolite catalysts for this aromatic alkylation. During WorldWar II there was also a high demand for ethylbenzene and styrene. Some units werebuilt to produce ethylbenzene by reacting ethylene with benzene over SPA catalyst.The reaction was slow and fairly inefﬁcient, so SPA never gained relevance for thisapplication; most ethylbenzene units at the time made use of aluminum chloridecatalysts. Today, practically all existing capacity makes use of acid zeolite catalysts.
World War II also led to increased demand and production of polyvinylchloride (PVC).
PVC is an excellent plastic material but lacks the ﬂexibility required for many ap-plications. It was discovered, however, that octyl phthalates and the esters of higheralcohols could be used to “plasticize” PVC; that is, to make it more ﬂexible and supple.Octyl to decyl alcohols could be obtained by the “oxo” reaction (hydroformylationreaction) of oleﬁns with carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The corresponding oleﬁns,with one carbon less than the desired alcohols, could be recovered as by-productsfrom the gasoline operation simply by fractionating the desired oleﬁns out of theoleﬁnic gasoline blend obtained by the Catalytic Condensation process. To this date,this is still the way that these oleﬁns, from heptenes to nonenes, are produced, exceptthat now these oleﬁns are the main products from this operation, and the remaininglighter and heavier fractions are blended back into the gasoline pool.
A further application that derived from World War II was the advent of synthetic deter-
gents to overcome the shortage of soap caused by the diversion of glycerin supplies tothe manufacture of explosives. Though not readily biodegradable, one of the earliestand still one of the most active detergent ingredients is dodecylbenzene sulfonate.This was obtained by ﬁrst alkylating dodecene with benzene according to technologydeveloped independently by UOP and Standard Oil of California (now Chevron).Dodecene, or propylene tetramer, was readily produced by the oligomerization ofpropylene over SPA catalyst.
Still, in the apex of its success, the Catalytic Condensation process was used mostly for
the production of gasoline fractions. During World War II, an important component in376 CHAPTER 9
the aviation fuels used in ﬁghter airplanes of that time was hydrocodimer, described
more fully below. This together with cumene, also derived from phosphoric acidcatalyst operations, was credited with being a signiﬁcant factor in Britain’ s successin the Battle of Britain. The typical reﬁnery product was known as polymer gasolineor “poly gasoline” even though in reality it consisted mostly of fairly simple dimersand trimers. At one time there were as many as 300–400 Catalytic Condensation unitsproducing gasoline alone. Today, production of polymer gasoline is less signiﬁcant,but the Catalytic Condensation process is still the preferred route to oleﬁn dimers andoligomers and, despite the inroads made by zeolitic catalysts, is still widely used forthe production of cumene. Based on the current demand for SPA catalyst, it may beestimated that about 40% is for gasoline, 40% for higher oleﬁns (plasticizer oleﬁns),and the balance 20% for cumene applications.
SPA catalyst may contain as much as 65 wt% phosphoric acid, but not all is active. Only
the so-called “free phosphoric acid” provides catalytic activity, and this is typicallyaround 16–20 wt% of the catalyst as manufactured. The activity of SPA is dictatedby its equilibrium with water. Anhydrous phosphoric acid, P
2O5, is not catalytic
for it lacks the hydroxyl groups that are necessary for activity. Too much water, onthe other hand, may cause the catalyst to get “soupy” and lose mechanical strengthor even dissolve and come out of the unit. The successful operation of a CatalyticCondensation unit with SPA catalyst requires a close control on the water balancegoing into the reactor, both in order to obtain the desired level of activity and also inorder to achieve long catalyst lives. Use of SPA catalyst in aromatic alkylation unitsmay present additional constraints owing to the partial solubility of the phosphoricacid in aromatic streams; a small purge stream of phosphoric acid is usually maintainedin these units.
Catalytic condensation process for gasoline production"
"Figure 9.2.1 illustrates a simpliﬁed process ﬂow diagram for gasoline production
using a tubular reactor. Figure 9.2.2 illustrates a similar diagram using an adiabaticplug ﬂow reactor. Either type can be used, except that smaller size catalyst particlesare normally used with a tubular reactor so as to minimize wall effects.
The tubular reactor system has the catalyst in the tubes and condensate or boiler
feed water is used to remove the exothermic heat of reaction and to raise steam onthe shell side. The reactants are circulated through the catalyst and the efﬂuent iscooled and passed to a stabilizer column. An LPG (propane–butane) recycle may bemaintained to control the concentration of oleﬁns in the feed and the heat release inthe system. Usually, the oleﬁn concentration in the feed to the reactor is maintainedat not more than about 50%. The gasoline produced is removed via the bottoms of thestabilizer.GASOLINE COMPONENTS 377

by either system are almost identical.
Table 9.2.1 illustrates a typical product composition distribution based on a mixed
C3-C4feed from an FCC unit expressed as weight percent of the oleﬁns in the charge
stock. Feed oleﬁn conversion is about 97% for propylene and 93% for butenes, butthis may vary somewhat depending on the state of the catalyst, the feed composition,and the operating conditions. Table 9.2.2 provides typical distillation properties ofdepentanized gasoline; actual composition will vary depending on what vapor pres-sure adjustments are desired to adapt the product to the gasoline pool requirements.This means that the end product may also contain some pentenes and butenes if thehigher vapor pressure is acceptable for blending into the gasoline pool.
Table 9.2.2 also serves to illustrate three different typical operations of these units:
(1) polymer gasoline made from propylene only with no attempt made to producehigher oleﬁns beyond the gasoline range; (2) polymer gasoline from a mixed C

gravities of all three products are virtually identical. Although these data are from
actual commercial operations, some differences arise from unit to unit. Also, it maybe appreciated that the mid-point (50%) and the end point (100%) for a propylene feedare higher than for mixed feeds or butene feeds. In actual practice, these end points canbe adjusted in order to meet product speciﬁcations. Often too the amount of polymergasoline blended into the pool is small, so that it does not signiﬁcantly alter the overallproperties of the pool; only seldom is the product rerun in order to meet more stringentspeciﬁcations. Interestingly, the product from a mixed C
3-C4feed, although having
a higher molecular weight, has a lighter boiling range than that of the propyleneproduct. The butene product in Table 9.2.2 is typical of a codimer operation. Thistype of operation was rare in the past, but because the octane number from this modeof operating is exceptionally high, it is currently generating considerable interest as areplacement for the production of methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in existing MTBEunits, and will be discussed later in more detail.
Hydrogenated versus nonhydrogenated polymer gasolines
from the catalytic condensation process
Polymer gasoline as obtained is almost totally oleﬁnic. Polymer oleﬁns, however, can"
"be easily hydrogenated to yield a very interesting range of products. Most polymergasolines blended in the gasoline pools have traditionally been oleﬁnic, without anyattempt of hydrogenation. When the Catalytic Condensation process was ﬁrst de-veloped, polymer gasoline was far better than the natural straight-run materials thenavailable. Gasoline characteristics have changed dramatically since the 1930s, andwhile polymer gasoline used to be the best material in the leaded gasoline pool be-cause of its excellent lead susceptibility, it is now one of the poorest in today’ s unleadedgasolines. This perception, however, can be altered signiﬁcantly if, instead of con-sidering untreated polymer gasoline, one looks at the properties of the hydrogenatedproducts.
Oleﬁnic products have a high Research (R) octane number (RON), but a low Mo-
tor (M) octane number (MON). As a result, the average octane index, (R +M)/2,
of unsaturated polymer gasolines is low. The difference (RON–MON) is called theoctane sensitivity; saturated or parafﬁnic products usually do not have a high octanesensitivity and in general, but not always, have much higher octane indices.
Hydrogenation is frequently performed at conditions that lead to the skeletal isomer-
ization of the product. Polymer gasolines from SPA catalysts are highly branched,much more than predicted from thermodynamic equilibrium. Therefore, skeletal iso-merization of these products would tend to move in the direction to equilibrium and,thus, to less branched products and to lower octane numbers. Thus, in general, hydro-genation catalysts that avoid isomerization should be selected.380 CHAPTER 9

Table 9.2.3 illustrates typical octane numbers of clear oleﬁnic and hydrogenated
products. These values were measured on actual commercial samples and correspondto the trends that can be observed with these products. It is clear that hydrogenationdoes not enhance the octane numbers in all cases, so polymer gasolines from propylenefeeds are best used without hydrogenation. It is interesting to note though that the MONof the hydrogenated material is much higher than the RON—an octane sensitivity ofminus 10 is quite unusual in gasoline components of any kind.
Polymer gasoline from propylene–butene mixtures has higher RON typically in the
96–97 range, and a MON of about 83. In the past, when tetra ethyl lead (TEL)was added, both of these numbers increased by about 3, so leaded polymer gasolinefrom propylene–butylene had excellent characteristics with (R + M)/2 of about 93.When this gasoline is hydrogenated, both the RON and MON drop signiﬁcantly, againrendering this product unattractive for motor fuel usage, but here too we encounter areverse octane sensitivity of minus six. We may add that, when used in its leaded form,the RON and MON of the hydrogenated product increased to 86 and 90, respectively,thus making it an acceptable blending component for the older leaded pools.
Of more interest is perhaps the operation with butene feed components. The RON
and MON of the product, sometimes called “codimer,” are up to 99 and 84, re-spectively. Contrary to the negative experience with propylene and propylene–butenefeedstocks, the hydrogenated product from an all-butene feed operation, sometimescalled “hydrocodimer,” has increased RON and MON of 99 and 94, respectively,which is excellent for gasoline blending in clear pools. This response was even morestriking in the past when lead was added. With the addition of 0.5 g/L TEL, the RONand MON increased to 110–112 and to about 103, respectively. However, even in theabsence of lead, both the oleﬁnic and the saturated products have excellent blendingcharacteristics.
Figure 9.2.3 illustrates an approximate linear correlation between the butene content
in the feed and the RON of the hydrogenated product. The more butene there is inGASOLINE COMPONENTS 381

the feed to the catalytic oleﬁn condensation unit, the higher will be the RON of the
hydrogenated product and the better the product will be as a parafﬁnic component ofthe gasoline pool. Because of the absence of oleﬁns and aromatics, this product meetsor exceeds all current environmental regulations.
It is seldom the case that the various components that integrate the composition of a"
"gasoline pool are used straight without blending. Normally, a motor fuel gasoline isa complex blend of hydrocarbons generated from a number of sources, for example:straight-run gasoline (mostly parafﬁnic with some aromatics, depending on the cut),alkylate (parafﬁnic), isomerate (parafﬁnic), reformate (aromatic), FCC gasoline (aro-matic), polymer gasoline (oleﬁnic or parafﬁnic), and sometimes also hydrocrackednaphtha (mostly parafﬁnic). The octane numbers of these various components do notblend as the octane numbers of the pure fractions; a “blending octane” has to be usedinstead. Thus, for example, if two gasoline materials both with an octane number of90 are blended together, there is no assurance that the mixture will have on octaneof 90; the octane of the blend may be the same, lower, or higher, depending on thesynergism among the various components as parametrized by the blending octane.
Table 9.2.4 illustrates the blending octanes of various polymer gasoline fractions
when blended with different base stocks. The reference base stock was a mixture ofapproximately 60% FCC gasoline and 40% reformate, having a clear octane of 93RON and 80.8 MON. Blend stocks consisting of the various polymer gasolines wereadded at 10 or 20 vol% levels and the blending octanes were back calculated fromthe octanes measured in the resulting mixtures. It must be noted, however, that smallerrors in the determination of the octane values can lead to signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations inthe estimation of the blending octanes.382 CHAPTER 9

Note: Base stock was a mixture of about 60% FCC gasoline
and 40% reformate with MON/RON of about 93/81.
Based on these studies, and for these particular base stocks, it was determined that
propylene-derived polymer gasoline had blending octanes of 94 RON and 83 MON;these values are almost identical to the clear values measured on the blend stock sothat there is no synergism between the propylene condensation product and the basestock. The situation with the propylene–butenes polymer gasoline is quite different.Here, the blend stock had RON and MON of 96 and 83, respectively, but it blendedwith the base stock at the 10% level as though the octane numbers of the blend stockwere 103 RON and 95 MON, a clear display of synergism with the base stock. Slightlydifferent but still very high blending values are obtained when blended at the 20 vol%level. Naturally, the blending values decline progressively when the blend stock isadded in higher and higher proportions, until they reach the clear measured values onthe blend stock at a 100% blend stock proportion.
The impact of synergism is even higher for the butene-derived polymer gasoline.
Here, instead of the measured octanes, 98 RON and 83 MON, we calculate blendingoctanes of 126 and 99, respectively, a synergism of 28 numbers for RON and 17numbers for MON.
The above observations are for the oleﬁnic catalytic condensation products. Similar
observations can be made with the hydrogenated products. In general, however, theparafﬁnic product does not exhibit signiﬁcant synergism with this type of base stock.
A corollary from these observations is that propylene polymer gasoline is fairly poor
for most motor fuel applications. Propylene–butene feeds can make reasonably goodgasolines, and the gasoline products from the Catalytic Condensation process basedon butenes can be best characterized as superb.GASOLINE COMPONENTS 383
Selective and nonselective gasoline production with the
catalytic condensation process
Most Catalytic Condensation operations with SPA catalysts are conducted in a non-
selective mode in which the main objective is to maximize conversion and the yield ofuseful products. Nonselective units tend to be operated at higher temperatures, typi-cally between 160
◦C inlet and 200◦C outlet temperatures for propylene or propylene–
butene feeds. The objective is to maximize the yield in the gasoline fraction at a targetoctane number with little regard for the occurrence of side reactions that may modifythe skeletal structure of the isomers.
For butenes, however, there can be signiﬁcant differences between selective and nons-
elective operations. Nonselective operations at higher temperatures typically will pro-duce some C
6’ s and C 7’ s, a lot of C 8’s , C 9’s , C 10’ s, and C 11’ s, and signiﬁcant amounts of
C12’ s. Selective operations are carried out at lower temperatures and usually at a lower
space velocity. The butenes react selectively with each other to form virtually noth-ing but the product dimers, C
8, and trimers, C 12. Most of the dimers are the so-called
“codimers,” or selective condensation products of one molecule of isobutene with onemolecule of n-butene. The resulting codimers are trimethylpentenes. Typical proper-"
"ties of the codimers and of their hydrogenated counterparts (the “hydrocodimers”) areillustrated in Table 9.2.5 (note that this material is slightly different from those shownin Table 9.2.3 or Table 9.2.4, always as a function of the precise feed compositionand the range of operating conditions). The total codimer product comprises the C
8
and C 12fractions, and has a very ﬂat boiling range even when expressed in terms
of an Engler or ASTM distillation, which is a less precise fractionation than a TBPdistillation. The total product had a 99 RON and a 82 MON. The hydrogenated total

product, including C 12’ s, had 98 RON and 93 MON. As expected, the speciﬁc gravity
of the parafﬁnic product is slightly lower than the gravity of the oleﬁnic material, but
the boiling range remains virtually unchanged. If one considers the C 8’ s only, after
fractionating out the C 12’ s, we obtain about 97 RON and 82 MON for the oleﬁnic
product, and about 99 and 93, respectively, for the saturated material. Not shown inhere but worth noting is that the lead response of the parafﬁnic product is alwaysmuch higher than for the oleﬁnic material.
The C
12materials thus made are quite unusual. They are relatively high boiling, and
thus hardly qualify as favored gasoline fractions, but the hydrogenated C 12’s h av e
RONs in the 95–97 range, which is indicative of a highly branched structure. Many
different isomers are made and a precise characterization of the product is difﬁcult.The operation can be conducted in the “dimer” mode with n-butenes only (1-butene
or 2-butene) reacting among themselves, but the end product is not as attractive asthe “codimer” that is obtained by reacting isobutene with n-butenes, or essentially
by reacting isobutene with 2-butene since 1-butene rapidly isomerizes to 2-buteneas the reaction proceeds. Figure 9.2.4 plots the octane number of the hydrogenateddimer product (in this case after only 90% hydrogenation), versus the weight ratioof isobutene reacted relative to the total weight of butenes reacted. The reciprocalof this value is sometimes called the “reaction ratio.” It was soon learned duringWorld War II that a low reaction ratio is desirable in order to obtain a high octaneproduct.
The reason that Figure 9.2.4 is based on only 90% hydrogenation is that, as shown in
Figure 9.2.5, a maximum RON is obtained when butylene dimers are hydrogenated tothe corresponding parafﬁns. This slight optimum is a function of the relative synergismGASOLINE COMPONENTS 385

between oleﬁns and parafﬁns and, although no longer used, is especially signiﬁcant
for the leaded material. Thus, for leaded material, partial hydrogenation of about85–90% leads to a maximum octane value. For clear, unleaded material, a maximumoctane value is obtained at around 60–70% hydrogenation. Because it is difﬁcult tocontrol the degree of hydrogenation, it is easier to simply bypass some of the materialaround the hydrogenation reactor.
Catalytic condensation process as a source of diesel fuels
The catalytic condensation process can also produce fuels in the diesel boiling range,
although because of their relatively high degree of branching, they all have fairly poorcetane characteristics, even after hydrogenation.
Table 9.2.6 illustrates a typical range of products in the diesel range obtained by the
Catalytic Condensation process with SPA catalyst followed by hydrogenation. Theworst product is the heavy polymer from a C
3–C4gasoline operation. The other three
materials are products derived from propylene feeds: propylene tetramer (dodecene),heavy polymer from a tetramer operation, and the entire feed to the tetramer rerundistillation column.
A commercial operation for the production of synthetic diesel fuel from propylene
was built in South Africa. The commercial results agree reasonably well with thenumbers in Table 9.2.6.386 CHAPTER 9

"It is possible to improve the quality of the diesel range products by operating in the
selective mode at lower temperatures and lower per-pass conversions with a higherrecycle rate of unconverted material. This approach, however, has not been commer-cialized.
Petrochemical operations
Petrochemical applications of catalytic oleﬁn condensation center on the production of
heptenes, nonenes, and dodecene (or propylene tetramer). Though initially recoveredby fractionating oleﬁns out of the oleﬁnic product from the Catalytic Condensationprocess for the production of polymer gasoline, modern units are speciﬁcally designedand operated to maximize the yield of the desired oleﬁn fractions. The by-productsare still blended into the gasoline pool.
Heptenes and nonenes are the main products used for the production of octyl and decyl
alcohols via the “oxo” or hydroformylation process. Both these alcohols ﬁnd end useas esters in plasticizer applications, principally for PVC. Dodecene at one time was amajor product for the manufacture of dodecylbenzene sulfonates as active detergentingredients; however, their relatively poor biodegradability led to the discontinuanceof this operation. Dodecenes are still used in the production of tridecyl alcohols via theoxo process. Some nonenes are also used in the production of nonyl phenols. Becausethis chapter is conﬁned to oleﬁn condensation, mostly for motor fuel applications,only heptenes and nonenes will be discussed brieﬂy.
Heptenes
Table 9.2.7 illustrates a wide range of speciﬁcations for heptenes. Though fairly com-
mon to all producers, the values can vary depending on the desired end-use application.GASOLINE COMPONENTS 387

other isomers can be present at lower concentrations. As a rule, dimethylpentenes
are produced mainly from isobutene, while methylhexenes tend to originate fromn-butenes.
The relative yield of heptenes is illustrated in Figure 9.2.6 as a function of the oleﬁnicfeed composition; as expected, higher yields of heptenes are obtained when the feedmixture consists of equal proportions of propylene and butenes. Isobutene tendsto produce signiﬁcantly higher yields of heptenes than n-butene. However, because
isobutene produces more dimethylpentenes, the ﬁnal yield can only be calculated onthe end product after fractionation that meets the required speciﬁcations.
Nonenes
Typical nonene speciﬁcations are shown in Table 9.2.9. Actually, there are several
different speciﬁcations that could be called “typical,” a main characteristic being thebreadth or narrowness of the cut.
A minimum oleﬁn concentration of 95% or higher is usually required. An oleﬁn con-"
"centration of 95% can be easily obtained for nonene units that process only propylenein the feed. However, in units that may also process oleﬁnic recycle streams, as forexample from a tetramer operation, there may be a reduction in the oleﬁn content ofthe product owing to hydrogen transfer mechanisms in which hydrogen is transferredfrom the heavier species to the lighter oleﬁns. Units with a high gasoline recyclemay experience increased parafﬁn concentrations in the nonene fraction as high as30–40%, which render the nonenes unsuitable as oxo plant feed. Most nonene unitsGASOLINE COMPONENTS 389

Dimersol™process
While the Catalytic Condensation process described above makes use of a supported
phosphoric acid catalyst, the Institut Fran¸ cais du P´ etrole (IFP) developed and com-mercialized a different approach based on Ziegler-Natta catalyzed oligomerizationusing organometallic catalysts. Because of the nature of the catalyst, this process canbe tailored to speciﬁc highly selective applications that have been identiﬁed by variousnames (2):
Dimerization of ethylene to 1-butene
This version is known as Alphabutol
™and is intended for the selective production of
1-butene for use as a comonomer in the production of linear low-density polyethylene
(LLDPE). Though not in the motor fuel range for reﬁnery applications, its mentionis included here for the sake of completeness and continuity with the other Dimersolprocess schemes. The reaction takes place under mild conditions at about 50–60
◦C,
under sufﬁcient pressure to maintain the reaction medium in the liquid phase, andin the presence of a homogeneous titanium-based catalyst. Under these conditions,then-butene equilibrium favors an almost total conversion of 1-butene to 2-butene;
therefore, it is critical that the catalyst have a total lack of isomerization activity. SomeC
6+ oligomers are also formed which are used to maintain the catalyst in solution.390 CHAPTER 9
Molar yields in excess of 93% can be achieved in this operation. This type of operation
is best suited for locations where LLDPE is being produced and in which there is noother local source of 1-butene. Alphabutol units have been reportedly built in SaudiArabia and Thailand.
Dimerization of ethylene to n-butenesWhereas the IFP Alphabutol process is selective for the production of 1-butene, the
IFP Dimersol E process produces n-butenes and heavier oligomers. The Dimersol E
process also operates at about 50
◦C in the liquid phase with a Ziegler-type catalyst
that can be a nickel derivative activated by an organometallic reducing agent. Whereasthe Alphabutol process avoids isomerization, the Dimersol E features both dimeriza-tion and isomerization, and it produces a blend of n-butenes and heavier oligomers,
depending on the feed composition, the actual type of catalyst, and the operating con-ditions. For polymer-grade ethylene, the Dimersol E process yields 30–70% n-butenes
with a once-through conversion of 90–100%, with the rest being in the C
6+ gasoline
fraction. Gasoline production can be further enhanced by adding propylene to thefeed. It is worth noting though that in the Dimersol E process the ratio of 1-butene to2-butene in the product is about 1/1, still well above the equilibrium ratio at 50
◦C.
Dimerization of propylene and butenes, separately or combined
The Dimersol process (Figure 9.2.7) uses an organometallic catalyst consisting of a
nickel salt in combination with an alkylaluminum compound. Various modalities areavailable:
rDimersol G—for the dimerization of propylene to isohexenes used in gasolineblending
rDimersol E—for the oligomerization of ethylene and propylene oleﬁns containedin FCC gases and already described above for the nonselective dimerization andoligomerization of ethylene
rDimersol X—for the selective dimerization of propylene and butenes for the produc-tion of heptenes or for the dimerization of n-butenes for the production of octenes.
These octenes are fairly linear, have a poor octane number, and are unsuited forgasoline applications. Heptenes and octenes obtained from the Dimersol X processare feedstocks for the production of plasticizer alcohols."
"In all these Dimersol processes, the oleﬁnic feedstock and the liquid catalyst areintroduced into the reactor in a fashion compatible with the heat removal requirementsin the reaction system. The level of conversion and the distribution of dimers andoligomers depend on the number of reactors used in series, the residence time, andthe concentration of catalyst. The efﬂuent from the reactor is circulated through acatalyst neutralization and elimination section and a water wash before fractionationfor the desired cuts.GASOLINE COMPONENTS 391

Other dimerization or oligomerization processes
No other dimerization or oligomerization processes are used commercially for the
catalytic condensation of light oleﬁns into gasoline range products, but Chevron inRichmond, California, and NPRC in Japan, use or have used liquid phosphoric acidto produce propylene tetramers. There are also a few highly selective processes thatare used for the production of speciﬁc dimers in petrochemical applications. Some ofthe most notable are:
rSulfuric acid dimerization of isobutene for the production of trimethylpentenes, inparticular a mixture of 2,2,4-trimethyl-1-pentene and 2,2,4-trimethyl-2-pentene.These are excellent gasoline blending components (once hydrogenated, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane is the reference 100 octane hydrocarbon for both RON and MON),but the technology is fairly messy and not used commercially. Liquid acid catal-ysis with either sulfuric acid or hydroﬂuoric acid is extensively used in reﬁningapplications for the alkylation of isobutane with n-butenes or other oleﬁns.
rSelective dimerization of propylene to 2-methyl-1-pentene over triethylaluminumin a process developed by Scientiﬁc Design and Goodyear. This dimer can be usedas an intermediate for the synthesis of isoprene.
rSelective dimerization of propylene to 4-methyl-1-pentene over organopotassiumcompounds or, in general, strong alkaline catalysts, in the liquid phase. 4-Methyl-1-pentene is a monomer used in the preparation of transparent plastics with ahigh melting point used in microwable cookware, labware, and medical products,and manufactured commercially by Mitsui Plastics under the name “TPX” and byPhillips 66 under the name “Crystalor.”392 CHAPTER 9
rH¨uls AG’ s Octol process for the selective dimerization of n-butenes to highly lin-
ear octenes suitable for the manufacture of isononyl alcohol plasticizers over a
solid heterogenous catalyst. The product may contain up to 20% n-octene and over
50% methyl-heptenes, with a balance of dimethylhexenes and a small amount oftrimethylpentenes, and is quite similar to that obtained with IFP’ s Dimersol X pro-cess.
Recent developments
Catalytic condensation of oleﬁns for the production of gasoline fractions and higher
oleﬁns is an old art that has recently received a boost from the planned phase-out ofMTBE in gasoline blending formulations.
MTBE (methyl-tert-butyl ether) is a high octane blending component used exten-
sively throughout the world since about 1975 and more widely since the mid-1980s.In addition to providing a signiﬁcant increase in the octane of the gasoline relative tothat of the base stock, it also has a beneﬁcial impact in the reduction of hydrocarbonemissions. MTBE, however, is slightly soluble in water (about 0.55 wt%) and has afoul odor. Leakage of gasoline from underground tanks into a potable water aquifernormally has little impact because of the lack of solubility of the hydrocarbon com-ponents, but becomes very noticeable when MTBE is present at even a low ppb level.This has led to the planned discontinuance in the use of MTBE in certain regions,principally in the United States.
MTBE is made by the reaction of isobutene with methanol over a sulfonic acid resin
in the liquid phase and at temperatures in the 40–80
◦C range in a process that was
independently pioneered by Snamprogetti SpA and by H¨ uls AG. Mostly, adiabaticplug ﬂow reactors are used, but isothermal tubular reactors have also been used; laterunits use reaction combined with distillation in what is a quasi-isothermal operation.MTBE initially was obtained by reacting the isobutene contained in the C
4fraction
from an FCC unit or from a steam cracker after butadiene extraction—the otherC
4components are not reactive under these conditions and only MTBE is formed.
However, with the advent of legislation that mandated the use of oxygenates in gaso-line for environmental reasons, use of MTBE skyrocketed and it became necessaryto build large on-purpose isobutane dehdyrogenation units to meet the demand forisobutene. These MTBE units often had capacities for about 600,000 to 900,000metric tons per year, of which about 65% corresponds to the weight of the requiredisobutene.
The planned phase-out of MTBE presents a costly dilemma for the existing MTBE"
"producers, principally for those who rely on isobutane dehydrogenation units. TheyGASOLINE COMPONENTS 393
can either shut down the units or they can convert them into something else. An
obvious solution is available in two forms:
rThe old codimer/hydrocodimer experience can be revisited either by dimerizingisobutene or by reacting isobutene with n-butenes over a SPA catalyst to yield the
corresponding isooctenes. However, while the older dimerization facilities operatedin the gas phase and had relatively poor selectivity to isooctenes, the newer versionsnow being implemented operate in the liquid phase and have much higher isoocteneselectivity. Also, the older hydrocodimer facilities required adding a costly hydrogenplant just to supply the hydrogen for the hydrogenation of the oleﬁns. In isobutane-based MTBE complexes this is not necessary because hydrogen is available as aby-product from the isobutane dehydrogenation step.
rSimilar experience can be derived from Bayer AG’ s use of sulfonic acid resins forthe dimerization of isobutene to the corresponding isooctenes in the liquid phaseat 100
◦C as done commercially at a plant in Dormagen operated by Erd¨ olchemie.
That experience showed that sulfonic acid resins can be used in hydrocarbon envi-ronments and can achieve over 99% isobutene conversions and about a 75 mol%selectivity to dimers and 25 mol% selectivity to trimers. Under appropriate modi-ﬁcations, use of sulfonic acid resins can be adapted to the selective production ofgasoline components.
Technologies for the dimerization of isobutene with isobutene, n-butenes, or other
oleﬁn components are now being offered commercially by Snamprogetti SpA, KBR(Kellogg—Brown & Root), UOP LLC, and others. Because UOP offers both SPAcatalyst and sulfonic acid resin catalyst, the following discussion will center on UOP’ sIndirect Alkylation (InAlk) process technology. It may be further added that isobutanedehyrogenation units operate equally well with n-butane or with mixtures of isobutane
andn-butane in the feed; the corresponding oleﬁns are obtained in these situations,
typically with a 1-butene/2-butene ratio that corresponds to the high temperaturedehydrogenation equilibrium.
Catalytic oleﬁn condensation with the InAlk process
Barring the use of MTBE and of the former hydrocodimer products, the best com-
ponents for today’ s environmentally friendly gasoline formulations are high-octaneparafﬁnic components like alkylate and isomerate. From the viewpoint of octanenumber and vapor pressure, alkylate is the preferred blending material.
Alkylate is made by reacting isobutane with n-butenes or other oleﬁns over con-
centrated sulfuric acid or hydroﬂuoric acid in the liquid phase, or over novel solid
heterogenous acid catalysts now being introduced.394 CHAPTER 9
The Indirect Alkylation or InAlk process obtains a product similar to motor fuel
alkylate by reacting isobutene with isobutene, n-butenes, or other oleﬁns, and also by
dimerization reactions of n-butenes. Idealized products after hydrogenation are:
2,2,4-trimethylpentane RON =100 MON =100
2,2,3-trimethylpentane RON =109.6 MON =99.9
3,4-dimethylhexane RON =76.3 MON =81.7
Either SPA catalysts or sulfonic acid resin catalysts can be used for the condensation.As usual, either noble or non-noble metal catalysts can be used for the hydrogenation.
Resin-catalyzed condensation
Sulfonic acid resin catalysts are attractive because they are the ones used for the
synthesis of MTBE. Thus, ideally, one could make isooctenes instead of MTBE withvirtually no plant modiﬁcation regardless of whether the original MTBE unit usesa conventional adiabatic plug ﬂow (packed bed) reactor or a reactor that combinesreaction with distillation as in CD Tech’ s “Catalytic Distillation” process or in theH¨uls/UOP “Ethermax” process. In the case of the Ethermax process, it has been
established that the same process unit can be used for the production of isoocteneswithout signiﬁcant modiﬁcations except perhaps for the addition of an additionalfront end packed-bed reactor for added conversion and, obviously, the hydrogenationreactor, and possibly a product stripper for the removal of light ends.
Overall isobutene conversions in excess of 95% are achievable, but the n-butene
conversion is much lower, in the order of 10%, so that an n-butene recycle should be
maintained if maximum conversion is desired. Selectivity to the desired diisobutenes
or isobutene/n -butene codimers is in the 85–90% range, while production of trimers
(C
12=) is about 10–15%, and the production of heavier compounds (tetramers, etc.)
is negligible. A typical trimethylpentane (TMP) product from an FCC C 4feed at about
10% n-butene per-pass conversion can be characterized as follows:
C8(TMP) 88%

"If not hydrogenated, the same product characteristics are obtained except that theRON increases to about 102.0–102.5 while the MON decreases to about 85.5–86.0,GASOLINE COMPONENTS 395
as corresponds to the higher octane sensitivity of oleﬁnic materials that was discussed
earlier.
With a high concentration isobutene feed as might be available from an isobutane
dehydrogenation unit, the product characteristics are:
C8 (TMP) 88%
C12 12%
C16 traces
Blending characteristics
RON 99–101
MON 97–100RVP ∼2 psi (∼14 kPa)
If not hydrogenated, the oleﬁnic product shows similar characteristics but with RONin the 111–114 range and MON of about 92–95.
SP A-catalyzed condensation
Although analogous in concept to the earlier work with SPA catalysts, signiﬁcantly
enhanced results can be obtained by ﬁne tuning the operation for gasoline produc-tion, in particular by increasing the isooctene selectivity at lower temperatures andoperation in the liquid phase. While traditional Catalytic Condensation units withSPA catalyst had isooctene selectivity of typically about 55%, in the InAlk process,operating in the liquid phase at lower temperatures, the selectivity can be increased toabout 90%, with the rest being C
12. This material can be put directly into the gasoline
pool, usually after hydrogenation.
Again, an MTBE unit can be converted to an InAlk unit with SPA catalyst with only
minor modiﬁcations, of which the most signiﬁcant is perhaps the addition of anotherfront end reactor in parallel.
A typical trimethylpentane (TMP) product from an FCC C
4feed at about 15%
n-butene per-pass conversion can be characterized as follows:
C8(TMP) 95%
C12 5%

T
50/T90 232/275◦F (111/135◦C)396 CHAPTER 9
With SPA catalyst it is possible to increase the n-butene conversion to about 30%
by operating at slightly higher temperatures. Virtually the same results are obtained
except for about a one point decrease in both RON and MON.
If the feed has a high isobutene content, the product distribution after hydrogenation
is:
C7(TMP) 3%
C8 87%
C9 10%

The effect of temperature on isooctene selectivity can be best appreciated by the

Operation at the lower temperature but with added recycle improves the selectivity to
about 2.2% C 7−, 84.1% isooctenes, and 13.7% C 9+. Further improvements can be
achieved by operation at even lower temperatures or at other recycle rates.GASOLINE COMPONENTS 397

It may be further noted that by operation at these lower temperatures, the life of the
SPA catalyst can be greatly lengthened relative to that observed in traditional CatalyticCondensation operations. The increased catalyst life is the net effect of having lowercarbon deposition on the catalyst and of requiring lower SPA hydration rates. Underthese conditions, the catalyst life is so much longer that the impact of feed impuritiesmay become the issue in determining the overall catalyst life.
Lastly, we can point out that, because it does not have the temperature limitations in-
herent to a sulfonic acid resin, SPA catalysts can operate over a signiﬁcantly broaderrange than just propylene or butenes. Figures 9.2.8 and 9.2.9, for example, illus-trate the comparative conversions and product RON values for isobutene, n-butenes,

Conclusions
Catalytic oleﬁn condensation is one of the oldest catalytic processes used in reﬁning
and petrochemical operations and pioneered the used of acid catalysts. Many cata-lysts have been used over the years that have been examined, albeit brieﬂy, in thischapter. Solid phosphoric acid catalysts (SPA) were for many years the work horseof the industry, and still command a very respectable market share. Zeolitic catalystsare slowly making some inroads in this area, but much more slowly than originallyexpected in view of their initial success in the alkylation of aromatics. More surpris-ingly, this old technology is currently enjoying a bit of a revival by the introductionREFERENCES 399
of highly selective, low temperature, liquid phase operations in which both sulfonic
acid resins and SPA are ﬁnding new niche opportunities. If catalysts can be foundwith higher selectivity to more linear oligomers in the C
12to C 18range, additional
markets may develop in the production of high-quality synthetic diesels and jet fuels.

naphtha and reﬁnery light ends
Peter R. Pujad´ o*
Upgrading light hydrocarbon (C 4–C6) streams in reﬁneries and gas processing plants
has increased in importance as new regulations affecting gasoline composition are
enacted in many regions of the world. These regulations include lead phasedown,benzene minimization, and oxygen content requirements. Light-naphtha isomeriza-tion plays a key role in meeting octane demands in the gasoline pool that result fromboth lead phasedown and increasing market share for premium gasoline grades. Byisomerization we mean the skeletal isomerization of a parafﬁn to a more branchedparafﬁn with the same carbon number; however, because of its nature, isomerizationmay also affect some of the naphthene components and will also hydrogenate aro-matics. In fact, isomerization is the most-economic means available for reducing thebenzene content in gasoline.
Several isomerization technologies are available from various licensors. UOP’ s Penex
process for the isomerization of C
5–C6parafﬁns and Butamer process for the isomer-
ization of n-butane to isobutane are some of the most widely used and will form the
basis for this chapter. Developments in isomerization are usually based on the intro-duction of new, more active or more stable catalysts, some of which will be discussedin more detail below. Similar comments could be made for other equivalent processesor catalysts available from other sources.
Introduction
The skeletal isomerization of alkanes is one of many important industrial applica-
tions of acid-function-promoted catalysis. Other examples of the wide commercialapplication of acid-catalyzed industrial hydrocarbon reactions are the alkylation ofparafﬁns and aromatics with oleﬁns, transalkylation and disproportionation of aro-matics, metathesis of oleﬁns, oligomerization of oleﬁns, etheriﬁcation and hydration

of oleﬁns, and hydrocracking. Although these various applications have some simi-
larities, they are all promoted by an acidic catalyst and often by a metal function. Thespeciﬁc catalytic requirements for achieving a highly economic result have led to theproliferation of specialized catalytic materials.
This paper focuses on light parafﬁn isomerization. The primary commercial use of the
branched isomers of C
4,C5, and C 6parafﬁns is in the production of clean-burning,"
"high-performance transportation fuels. The elimination of tetraethyl lead over the last30 years as a means of improving the antiknock properties of gasoline and more recentregulations restricting motor fuel composition have led reﬁners to select alternativemeans of producing high-quality gasoline. As a result of benzene concentration re-strictions, end-point and oleﬁn content limitations, and potential limitations on totalaromatics concentration, the choices of high-quality gasoline blending componentsavailable in the typical reﬁnery are limited. Isomerate, the gasoline blending compo-nent from light parafﬁn isomerization, is an ideal choice. Another equally valuableblending components is alkylate resulting primarily from the acid-catalyzed reactionof isobutene with an aliphatic oleﬁn. Both isomerization and alkylation yield highlybranched, high-octane parafﬁnic blending components that by themselves can satisfythe strictest environmental requirements. Often, n-butane isomerization is one of the
sources for the isobutane requirements in alkylation.
Because of the heightened demand for isomerate, reﬁners continue to look for increas-
ingly effective and economic means of producing this valuable blending component.Over the years, UOP has developed and continues to develop new catalyst systems inorder to improve process economics and operability. This paper discusses two exam-ples, the LPI-100 and I-80 catalysts in terms of their fundamental improvement overexisting catalysts in various processing options and, most important, the increasedvalue available to reﬁners who use these new high-performance isomerization cata-lysts.
Process chemistry of parafﬁn isomerization
The octane rating of the components used in the manufacture of the various commer-
cial gasoline grades is indicative of the antiknock quality of a given fuel or compo-nent. The inherent octane values of different hydrocarbons have led to a variety ofprocessing strategies to produce high-octane components for the production of high-performance motor fuel. In the case of C
5and C 6parafﬁns, the most highly branched
isomers have the highest-octane values. In the case of butanes, octane is somewhatirrelevant because the majority of isobutane is consumed in the production of motorfuel alkylate and oxygenates. Octane values for C
5and C 6parafﬁn isomers are shown
in Table 9.3.1 (1). The two empirical octane measurement methods, research (ASTMMethod 2699), and motor (ASTM Method 2700), measure antiknock characteristics402 CHAPTER 9

Similarly, the hexane isomer, 2,2-dimethylbutane (2,2-DMB) has an octane about 67numbers higher than n-hexane. Clearly, highly branched isoparafﬁns are the desired
isomers for motor fuel production.
Thermodynamic equilibria for the branched parafﬁn isomers are generally favored
by low temperatures. Figures 9.3.1, 9.3.2, and 9.3.3 illustrate this trend (2). Themost active catalyst, when all other variables are equal, is capable of producing thehighest-octane products.

Primary reaction pathways
Parafﬁn isomerization is most effectively catalyzed by a dual-function catalyst con-
taining a noble metal and an acid function. The reaction is believed to proceed throughan oleﬁn intermediate, which is formed by parafﬁn dehydrogenation on the metal site(reaction (1)):
CH
3-CH 2-CH 2-CH 3↔Pt
CH 3-CH 2-CH=CH 2+H2. (1)
Although the equilibrium conversion of the parafﬁn in reaction (1) is low at parafﬁnisomerization conditions, sufﬁcient oleﬁns are present to be converted to a carboniumion by the strong acid site (reaction (2)):

The formation of the carbonium ion removes product oleﬁns from reaction (1) and
allows the equilibrium in reaction (1) to proceed. The carbonium ion in reaction (2)undergoes a skeletal isomerization, probably through a cycloalkyl intermediate asshown in reaction (3):"

Reaction (3) proceeds with difﬁculty because it requires the formation of a primarycarbonium ion at some point in the reaction. Nevertheless, the strong acidity of iso-merization catalysts provides enough driving force for the reaction to proceed at highrates. The isoparafﬁnic carbonium ion is then converted to an oleﬁn through loss ofa proton to the catalyst site (reaction (4)):
CH

In addition to these primary reaction pathways, some evidence indicates the exis-tence of a bimolecular reaction mechanism, in which oleﬁnic intermediates dimerize,internal carbon atoms are protonated, skeletal isomerization occurs, and the dimerundergoes beta scission that results in the product isoparafﬁn. In addition to the C
13
labeling experiments that support this mechanism, a relatively small amount of hy-drocarbons containing carbon numbers higher than the feed are always found in thereaction products. The bimolecular mechanism has a minor impact on commercialisomerization processing.
Isomerization catalysts
Operation at the lowest temperature results in the formation of the highest-octane
product (Table 9.3.1 and Figures 9.3.1, 9.3.2, and 9.3.3). Catalyst activity and thelowest operating temperature are important to achieve an economic operation. In theprevious discussion of the primary reaction pathway, the primary functionality of aparafﬁn isomerization catalyst is to protonate a secondary carbon atom. All knownparafﬁn isomerization catalysts have a combination of strong Lewis and Br¨ onstedacid sites, which result in varying levels of protonation activity.GASOLINE COMPONENTS 405
In addition to a strong acid function, isomerization catalysts must also be capable
of hydrogenolysis, which not only assists in the protonation step, but also servesto saturate oleﬁn intermediates and aromatic hydrocarbons and to assist in the ringopening of cycloparafﬁns. This function also gives activity stability to isomerizationcatalysts, thereby improving the process economics.
An aluminum chloride catalyst for alkane isomerization was ﬁrst developed in the
1930s (3). The original application was for the conversion of n-butane to isobutane,
which was, and still is, reacted with C
3,C4, and C 5oleﬁns to produce motor fuel
alkylate. The ﬁrst application of this high-octane product was in the production ofhigh-octane aviation gasoline. Subsequent developments of this predominantly Lewis-acid catalyst resulted in the current alumina-supported, bifunctional catalyst. UOP’ sI-8 catalyst is one commercial example of this catalyst system, which has seen widecommercial application since 1981.
Chlorided alumina, the highest-activity parafﬁn isomerization catalyst available, in-
creases the octane of a typical light-naphtha stream from about 70 to as high as 85RONC in a once-through parafﬁn isomerization unit. Higher product octanes, up to93 RONC, can be obtained by recycling low-octane hydrocarbons. The C
+
5yield from
chlorided alumina catalysts is the highest from any commercial catalyst because of
high catalyst selectivity and low operating temperature. Because chlorided aluminasystems are not economically regenerable, eventual reloading of the isomerizationcatalyst must be considered. Nevertheless, the chlorided alumina system is often themost-economic choice because of its inherent high activity. In addition, only chloridedalumina catalysts have enough activity to economically isomerize butanes.
As a result of ongoing intensive research and development in parafﬁn isomeriza-
tion technology, UOP’ s I-80 catalyst is one of the highest-activity chlorided aluminacatalyst currently available. The I-80 catalyst, is signiﬁcantly more active than theI-8 catalyst, and is based on a unique formulation and manufacturing technique. Bysimply reloading the I-80 catalyst in existing reactors, a gain of 0.5–1.0 RON can berealized compared with the product RON when I-8 catalyst is used.
Zeolitic isomerization catalysts, such as UOP’ s HS-10™ or I-7™ catalysts, operate at
higher temperatures than chlorided alumina catalysts. The maximum product octanethat can be achieved is limited by the unfavorable equilibrium at these conditions.Yields are also lower as a result of the higher operating temperature and the less-selective characteristics of zeolitic catalysts. A typical octane upgrade for a once-through zeolitic isomerization unit is from 70 to about 79 RONC. Higher productoctanes (86–88) can be obtained in a recycle operation, such as a TIP™ unit.
The most-attractive beneﬁt of zeolitic isomerization catalysts is that they are not
permanently deactivated by water or other oxygenates and are fully regenerable.406 CHAPTER 9"
"Consequently, zeolitic catalysts have often been used when revamping other process
units, such as hydrotreaters or reformers to isomerization service. Sulfur can be presentin the feedstock with catalysts such as the HS-10 catalyst, but performance is alwaysaffected to some degree. Sulfur suppresses the platinum function as it does in anyplatinum-containing catalyst. Although isomerization activity is maintained, a net C
+
5
product yield loss results. Hydrotreating is not an absolute requirement with zeolitic
catalysts, but it is necessary to get the optimum performance from the catalyst.
Sulfated metal oxide catalysts, which have been described as solid super acids, exhibit
high activity for parafﬁn isomerization reactions. These metal oxides form the basisof the new generation of isomerization catalysts that have been actively discussedin the scientiﬁc literature in recent years. These catalysts are most commonly tinoxide (SnO
2), zirconium oxide (ZrO 2), titanium oxide (TiO 2), or ferric oxide (Fe 2O3)
that has been sulfated by reaction with sulfuric acid or ammonium sulfate. Sulfatedalumina is not an active catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions.
A typical metal oxide catalyst, UOP’ s LPI-100 catalyst (4), has a considerably higher
activity than that of traditional zeolitic catalysts, and this activity advantage is equiva-lent to about 80
◦C lower reaction temperature. The lower reaction temperature allows
for a product with a signiﬁcantly higher product octane, about 82 RONC for a typ-ical feed or three numbers higher than that of a zeolitic catalyst. Similar to zeoliticcatalysts, the LPI-100 catalyst is not permanently deactivated by water or oxygenatesin the feedstock. These catalysts are also fully regenerable using a simple oxidationprocedure that is comparable to the one used for zeolitic catalysts. The high activ-ity of the LPI-100 catalyst makes it an ideal choice for revamping existing zeoliticisomerization units for higher capacity and higher octane isomerate or for new unitswhere the full performance advantage of chlorided alumina catalysts is not requiredor where the reﬁner is concerned about contaminants in the feedstock.
The isomerization performance of the previously discussed I-8, I-80, HS-10, and LPI-
100 catalysts is compared in Figure 9.3.4, which plots the i-C
5to total C 5product ratio
for all the catalysts as a function of reactor temperature. This ranking clearly illustratesthe striking activity advantage for the LPI-100 catalyst over that of the zeolitic HS-10catalyst, an advantage that translates directly to octane improvement. Likewise, thisranking shows the performance beneﬁt of the I-80 catalyst over the predecessor I-8catalyst. The development and beneﬁts of the I-80 and LPI-100 catalysts, are discussedin the following sections.
I-80 catalyst development and applications

1981. The I-8 catalyst has been successfully used in more than 50 operating Bu-
tamer™ butane isomerization units and 90 operating Penex™ light-naphtha isomer-ization units. The ﬂow schemes range from simple once-through hydrocarbon pro-cesses to complex recycle operations to achieve high product octane that have beendescribed in detail elsewhere (5). In 1998, UOP introduced the I-80 catalyst, a newgeneration, high-activity chlorided alumina catalyst. The I-80 catalyst has stabilityand selectivity identical to that of the I-8 catalyst.
Higher catalyst activity can be used in a number of ways in existing or new isomeriza-
tion units. The best application depends on site-speciﬁc factors and whether the unitoperates in a once-through or recycle mode. Typical means to exploit higher activityare:
rHigher throughput at constant octane (Case A)
rReduced catalyst volume at constant throughput and octane (Case B)
rHigher octane at the same throughput (Case C)
rLonger catalyst life (Case D)
Case A operates at higher throughput but maintains a constant product octane. The per-formance of the I-8 and I-80 catalysts is compared in Figure 9.3.5 as a plot of productoctane against relative reactor temperature. The newer I-80 catalyst has a substantial30% activity advantage over the previous catalyst. This advantage is equivalent toabout a 12
◦C reduction in reactor temperature. A 30% activity increase corresponds
directly to an increase in space velocity, or throughput.
If the I-80 catalyst is reloaded in place of the existing I-8 catalyst, the charge rate to"
"the reactor can be increased by up to 30% with no decrease in product octane. Thisthroughput advantage is a major beneﬁt in equipment cost savings if a higher-capacityrevamp is being considered because additional reactor volume is not required. Another408 CHAPTER 9

beneﬁt of a higher-activity catalyst is the increased ﬂexibility to respond to seasonal
ﬂuctuations in product demand.
The ability to operate at higher space velocities with the I-80 catalyst can be used in
existing units by reducing the volume of catalyst in the reactor of existing units byup to 30% and using a smaller overall reactor size in new units (Case B). These costsavings are obvious. The reﬁner also realizes a savings in platinum inventory.
As mentioned previously, isomerization reactions are equilibrium limited and the
extent of the reaction improves at lower temperatures. The 12
◦C activity advantage
of the I-80 catalyst can be exploited by operating at a lower temperature to achievehigher product octanes (Case C). This advantage is illustrated in Figure 9.3.6 as aplot of product octane against C

quality at similar yields is possible with the I-80 catalyst in once-through units. This
improvement in quality is equivalent to an additional revenue of about $600,000 U.S.per year at an octane value of $0.25 per octane-barrel. Thus, the I-80 catalyst is anobvious choice when catalyst replacement is required. The beneﬁt for recycle units islower because the savings are related to the cost reduction associated with maintaininghigher conversion per pass.
The higher activity of the I-80 catalyst is achieved by increasing the number of
catalytically active sites on the catalyst surface. Because the deactivation of chloridedalumina catalysts is mostly due to ingress of moisture or oxygenates, this higheracid-site density can translate into longer catalyst life at a constant catalyst loading(Case D). If all other factors are equal, catalyst life may be extended by about 30%.Increased catalyst life has the obvious beneﬁt of reducing operating costs. However,the beneﬁt is relatively small in well-run commercial units that typically achieve acatalyst life in excess of 5 years.
LPI-100 catalyst development and applications
The development of the LPI-100 catalyst represents the ﬁrst successful application
of sulfated metal oxide in industrial catalysis. This new catalyst is the culmination ofa joint development effort between Cosmo Research Institute (CRI) and MitsubishiHeavy Industries (MHI) in Japan and UOP .
The basic formulation for this sulfated metal oxide catalyst was developed by CRI
and MHI researchers in the late 1980s. Several years of intensive development wererequired to translate the CRI–MHI laboratory formulation into a commercially vi-able extruded catalyst that met all the original performance targets. The commercialproduct is now the UOP LPI-100 catalyst.
The ﬁrst commercial loading of the LPI-100 catalyst was completed at the Flying J
Reﬁnery in North Salt Lake City, Utah. The catalyst was loaded in a zeolitic isomer-ization reactor that had previously been operated with UOP’ s I-7 catalyst. The loadingwas completed and the reactor placed into operation in December 1996. Performancedata for the LPI-100 catalyst in the Flying J unit are compared to pilot plant predictionsin Figure 9.3.7 as a plot of the i-C
5to total C 5product ratio against reactor temperature.
The performance at Flying J was in line with UOP’ s expectations. Since the initial op-eration at Flying J, the LPI-100 catalyst has been used in another once-through zeoliticisomerization unit in Canada and in other units in Canada and the Middle East.
Contaminant-sensitivity studies with the LPI-100 catalyst have shown responses
comparable to those experienced with conventional zeolitic catalysts. Water andoxygenates at typical concentrations are not detrimental. Sulfur suppresses activity, as410 CHAPTER 9

expected for any catalyst containing noble metals. The suppression effect of sulfur is
reversed by subsequent processing with clean feedstocks. The effects of other commoncontaminants are similar to those experienced with conventional zeolitic catalysts.
In pilot plant evaluations, the stability of the LPI-100 catalyst is comparable that of"
"the HS-10 zeolitic catalyst. This stability translates to a commercial process cycle ofat least 18 months before regeneration is required. Multiple-cycle regeneration testingwas completed and showed that the catalyst was fully regenerable through more thanthree regenerations. Regeneration consists of a simple carbon-burn step at conditionscomparable to those used for regenerating zeolitic catalysts.
New isomerization process technologies
The introduction of new catalyst systems, such as the LPI-100 catalyst, allows the de-
velopment of new process technologies that fully use the characteristics of the catalyst.The process technology developed for the LPI-100 catalyst is the Par-Isom™ pro-cess. A simpliﬁed ﬂow scheme for the Par-Isom process operating in a once-throughconﬁguration is shown in Figure 9.3.8. For simplicity, a once-through hydrocarbonﬂow scheme is discussed in this chapter. Recycle ﬂow schemes previously developedfor naphtha isomerization use either molecular sieve separation, such as in the TIPprocess, or fractionation, such as a deisohexanizer column.
The process ﬂow scheme shown in Figure 9.3.8 is similar to that used for conventional
once-through Penex and zeolitic isomerization units. The fresh C
5–C6feed is com-
bined with makeup and recycle hydrogen and directed to the charge heat exchanger,where the reactants are heated to reaction temperature. A ﬁred heater is not requiredin the Par-Isom process, because of the much lower reaction temperature needed withGASOLINE COMPONENTS 411

the LPI-100 catalyst than with zeolitic catalysts. Hot oil or high-pressure steam can
be used as the heat source in this exchanger. The heated combined feed is then sentto the isomerization reactor.
Either one or two reactors can be used in series, depending on the speciﬁc application.
Two reactors obtain the best performance from the process but at a higher capital andadditional catalyst inventory costs. In a two-reactor system, the ﬁrst reactor is operatedat higher temperature (200–220
◦C) to improve the reaction rate, and the second reactor
is operated at a lower temperature to take advantage of the more-favorable equilibriumdistribution of higher octane isomers. One reactor is generally speciﬁed for the Par-Isom process to reduce capital and operating cost of the unit, but a small debit inperformance can result.
The reactor efﬂuent is cooled and sent to a product separator, where the recycle hy-
drogen is separated from the other products and returned to the reactor section. Theliquid product is sent to a stabilizer column, where the light ends and dissolved hy-drogen are removed. The stabilized isomerate product can be sent directly to gasolineblending. In recycle ﬂow schemes, either molecular sieve or fractionation options areused to separate the lower-octane isomers for recycle to the reactor. The selection ofthe separation scheme depends on the feed composition, availability of utilities, andthe product octane desired.
The higher activity of the LPI-100 catalyst makes it an ideal candidate for revamps
of existing zeolitic isomerization units to achieve higher capacity or for revampsof idle process units, such as reformers or hydrotreaters to isomerization service.The integration of a Par-Isom reactor into an existing semiregeneratative reformingunit can be a particularly attractive revamp opportunity for economically addingisomerization capacity to a reﬁnery.

heater are added to operate in parallel with the existing reforming unit reactors.
The hydrogen required for the Par-Isom reactor is taken from the reforming unit
recycle compressor, combined with the light-naphtha charge, and sent to the Par-Isom reactor. The Par-Isom reactor efﬂuent is returned to the reforming unit. Theintegrated units share a common product condenser, product separator, and stabilizer.The isomerization unit at the Flying J Reﬁnery has operated successfully in this modesince 1986 and is currently operating as a Par-Isom unit.
Isomerization process economics
The economics of a process are the most-important consideration in selecting a tech-
nology for a given application. The Par-Isom process offers an economic alternativeto conventional isomerization processes. Two case studies illustrate the beneﬁts ofthis technology: one for reloading existing once-through zeolitic units (Case studyA) and the other for integration of a Par-Isom reactor into a reforming unit to addisomerization capacity (Case study B).
Case study A"
"The revamp of an existing once-through zeolitic isomerization unit is an excellent
application for the Par-Isom process because both increased product quality andthroughput can be realized. This increase is shown in Table 9.3.2 as a comparison ofthe base case (continued operation with current zeolitic catalyst) and the unit afterrevamp to the Par-Isom process. This example was selected to represent a typicalGASOLINE COMPONENTS 413

zeolitic process unit. The Par-Isom process allowed throughput to be increased by
25% along with an increased product octane of 2 RONC. An alternative would be torealizea3R O Nu p g rade by keeping the capacity constant. However, the economics
of this option are generally not as attractive as increasing throughput. Octane wasvalued at $0.25 per octane-barrel, and no substantial changes to existing equipmentwere considered in this case.
Two scenarios were considered: a shutdown case and an incremental case. In the
shutdown case, the current zeolitic catalyst was assumed to be operating satisfactorily,and so the revamp would have to justify replacement of the existing catalyst. Thepayback for this case was 1.7 years, which is equivalent to an internal rate of return(IRR) of 58%; typically a viable alternative for most reﬁners. In the incrementalcase, the zeolitic catalyst was assumed to be deactivated and new catalyst requiredfor continued operation of the unit. Revamp to the Par-Isom process is an attractiveoption in this situation. The payback was 1 year, or an IRR of 96% on the incrementalinvestment required for the revamp.
Case study B
New isomerization capacity is being considered in many areas of the world, such as
South America, Russia, and the Far East, as lead is being phased out of the gasolinepool or regulations on benzene or aromatics content are enacted. Often the reﬁneriesinvolved are hydroskimming-type reﬁneries that have limited conversion capacityand one or more semi-regenerative reforming units to upgrade the heavy naphtha414 CHAPTER 9
and provide a source of hydrogen. These reﬁneries are ideal candidates for adding
isomerization capacity by integrating a Par-Isom unit with the existing reforming unit(Figure 9.3.9).
The revamp in this example involved reloading a 600 kMTA (15,200 bpd) reforming
unit with UOP’ s R-56™ catalyst in place of the existing unit’ s less-stable reform-ing catalyst so that excess recycle hydrogen was available for the Par-Isom reactor.The Par-Isom reactor section is installed to operate in parallel with the reformingunit reactors. The addition of the Par-Isom unit involved installing a charge heaterusing high-pressure steam, a light-naphtha feed pump, the Par-Isom reactor, and thenecessary controls. The balance of the existing equipment, including the productcondenser, product separator, and stabilizer, was adequate for the integrated unit. Theestimated erected cost (EEC) for the Par-Isom reactor system, including an allowancefor royalties, was $2.3 million U.S. (4th Quarter 1997, U.S. Gulf Coast basis). Thecatalyst cost was $2.1 million U.S., excluding the cost of the platinum, and the totalinvestment cost was $4.4 million U.S.
Adding isomerization capacity is a low-cost means of increasing gasoline pool octane
(Table 9.3.3). The base case, without isomerization, produces a gasoline productconsisting of 494 kMTA (11,750 bpd) of 96 RONC reformate and 300 kMTA (8,780bpd) of 66 RONC light naphtha. The combined streams produce a gasoline product at

84.6 RONC and would require the addition of lead to make regular-grade gasoline. In"
"the revamp case, the light naphtha is upgraded in the Par-Isom reactor to a 79 RONC.Because of the nature of the feedstocks, achieving this high isomerate octane withconventional zeolitic catalysts is not possible. Some yield loss occurs in the Par-Isomreactor, and so 287 kMTA (8,325 bpd) of isomerate is available for blending withthe reformate. Adding the Par-Isom reactor provides sufﬁcient octane to produce atotal gasoline product at 781 kMTA (20,075 bpd) with a 89.8 RONC. Regular-gradegasoline can be produced in the integrated reforming and Par-Isom units without theaddition of lead.
The economics involved in the revamp are also shown in Table 9.3.3. The required
investment of $5.5 million U.S. includes catalyst, equipment, and royalty costs. ThePar-Isom unit provides an additional 65,897 octane-barrels to the gasoline pool, or$5.5 million U.S. if the octane is valued at $0.25 U.S. per octane-barrel. The simplepayback for the revamp is less than a year, and the internal rate of return is attractiveat 125%. Integrating the Par-Isom reactor with an existing reforming unit is clearlyan attractive solution to the challenges posed by lead phaseout or benzene reduction.
Other applications
The Par-Isom process can be considered for other applications, particularly for new
units. In general, chlorided alumina catalysts, such as the I-80 catalyst used in thePenex process provide the most cost-effective isomerization technology for grassrootsreﬁneries or for installing new units without revamping of existing equipment. Theadditional octane provided by these catalysts results in the most-value-added andmost-attractive economics.
In some cases, the Par-Isom technology should be considered for new units. Since
the Par-Isom process is the lowest capital cost option for once-through isomerizationunits, it is the process of choice when capital cost is a major concern. Another situationis when the primary processing objective is to minimize the benzene content in thegasoline pool, and sufﬁcient octane to meet the gasoline product blending require-ments already exists. Because the additional octane achieved by a chlorided aluminacatalyst may not have any value in these situations, the lower-cost Par-Isom processis the most economically attractive option.
Conclusions
Light-naphtha isomerization processes have become increasingly important in help-
ing reﬁners improve octane and meet the production demands for reformulated orlow-benzene-content gasoline. The discussion in this chapter has been based on therelative performance of UOP’ s catalysts. Similar conclusions could be drawn if usingequivalent catalyst from other suppliers.416 CHAPTER 9
The I-80 catalyst is one of the highest-activity chlorided alumina catalysts available to-
day. This catalyst provides a means to improve the proﬁtability of Penex and Butamerunits by improving octane or allowing for increased capacity or both. The 0.5–1 RONCadditional octane that can be provided by the I-80 catalyst makes this catalyst an obvi-ous choice for reloading existing units or for new installations that require high octane.
The commercialization of the LPI-100 catalyst and the Par-Isom process provides op-
portunities for upgrading existing zeolitic isomerization units or the low-cost additionof isomerization capacity in reﬁneries by revamping other process units or integrat-ing with semiregenerative reforming units. The Par-Isom process provides a low-cost,economically attractive route for reﬁners who must meet demands for higher octane orreformulated gasoline. In most cases, the revamp can be accomplished with minimalchanges to existing equipment. The high activity of the LPI-100 catalyst can result inup to 3 RON higher isomerate octane than can be achieved with zeolitic catalysts aswell as substantially higher throughput in revamp situations.

Reﬁnery gas treating processes
D.S.J. Jones
Introduction
Reﬁnery gas sweetening is the process used to remove the so called ‘ Acid Gasses’
which are hydrogen sulﬁde and carbon dioxide from the reﬁnery gas streams. Theseacid gas removal processes used in the reﬁnery are required either to purify a gasstream for further use in a process or for environmental reasons. Clean Air legislationnow being practiced through most industrial countries require the removal of theseacid gases to very low concentrations in all gaseous efﬂuent to the atmosphere. Hy-drogen Sulﬁde combines with the atmosphere to form very dilute sulfuric acid andcarbon dioxide to form carbonic acid both of which are considered injurious to per-sonal health. These compounds also cause excessive corrosion to metals and metallicobjects.
The following sections of this chapter describe the processes, their chemistry and a
method of calculating the design of the more common processes.
The process development and description
The use of chemically ‘ basic’liquids to react with the acidic gases was developed in
1930. The chemical used initially was Tri ethanol amine (TEA). However, as Monoethanol amine (MEA) became commercially more available it became the preferredliquid reactant due to its high acid gas absorption on a unit basis. The molecular weightof MEA is 61 while that for TEA is 149. As both react mole for mole with the acidgases 2.44 lbs of TEA must be circulated to achieve the same absorptive capacity as1 lb of MEA. TEA also suffers degradation at temperatures above its boiling point andas this is its regeneration temperature MEA has replaced TEA in this service. Since1955 numerous alternative processes to MEA have been developed. These have fewercorrosion problems and are to a large extent more energy efﬁcient. Inhibitor systemshave however been developed which have eliminated much of the MEA corrosion

problems. Some of these newer processes also are designed to selectively remove the
H2S leaving the CO 2to remain in the gas stream.
The process ﬂow and description of the more common processes are essentially thesame. This process ﬂow is shown in Figure 10.1.
For product gas streams which must meet lower than 1 grain per scf of H
2S, MEA
must be used. This amine, however, is degraded by certain sulﬁde compounds found
in gas from thermal crackers. The most common compound that degrades MEA iscarbonyl sulﬁde (COS). MEA can, however, be regenerated by batch or continuousvaporization and disposal of the sludge formed by the degeneration.
Referring to the above ﬂow sheet, sour gas (rich in H
2S) enters the bottom of the
trayed absorber (or contactor). Lean amine is introduced at the top tray of the absorber
section to move down the column. Contact between the gas and amine liquid on thetrays results in the H
2S in the gas being absorbed into the amine. The sweet gas is
water washed to remove any entrained amine before leaving the top of the contactor.
Rich amine leaves the bottom of the contactor to enter a surge drum. If the contactor
pressure is high enough a ﬂash stream of H 2S can be routed from the drum to a trayed
stripper. The liquid from the drum is preheated before entering a stripping column onREFINER Y GAS TREATING PROCESSES 419
the top stripping tray. This stripper is reboiled with 50 psig saturated steam. Saturated
50 psig steam is used because higher temperatures cause amines to break down. TheH
2S is stripped off and leaves the reﬂux drum usually to a sulfur production plant.
Sulfur is produced in this plant by burning H 2S with a controlled air stream.
The lean amine leaves the stripper bottom and is cooled. The cooled stream is routedto the contactor.
Common processes
There are several liquid solvents in commercial use for the removal of H
2S and CO 2
from reﬁnery gases. Among the more common are the amines. These include:
MEA Mono ethanol amine
DEA Diethanol amineDGA Diglycol amine
In addition to these amine base solvents there are also the hot potassium carbonate
process, sulﬁnol and ADIP . These latter two processes are marketed by the Shellcompany and are quite common in world wide usage.
It is not the intent here to detail all of these processes with their various properties.
The three amine solvents will however be described and discussed and some mentionwill be made of the other processes.
Mono ethanol amine
This is the most common acid gas absorption process. Normally 15–20 wt% MEA in"
"water is circulated down through a trayed absorber to provide intimate contact withthe sour gas. The rich solution is routed to a steam stripping column where it is heatedto about 250
◦F at 10 psig to strip out the acid gases. The lean MEA solution is then
returned to the absorber.
MEA is the most basic (and thus reactive) of the ethanol amines. MEA will completely
sweeten sour gases removing nearly all acid gases if desired. The process is well provenin reﬁnery operations.
Like all of the amine solvents used for acid gas removal MEA depends upon its amino
nitrogen group to react with the acidic CO
2and H 2S in performing its absorption. The
particular amines are selected with a hydroxyl group which increases their molecularweight and lowers their vapor pressures yielding minimum solvent losses to the gasstream. MEA is considered a chemically stable compound. If there are no otherchemicals present it will not suffer degradation or decomposition at temperatures upto its normal boiling point.420 CHAPTER 10

Some of the degradation products formed in these systems are highly corrosive.
They are usually removed by ﬁltration or reclaimer operations. Filtration will removecorrosive by products such as iron sulﬁde. Reclaiming is designed to remove heatstable salts formed by the irreversible reaction of MEA with COS, CS
2(carbonyl
sulﬁde and carbon disulﬁde). The reclaimer operates on a side stream of 1–3% of thetotal MEA circulation. It is operated as a stream stripping kettle to boil water and MEAoverhead while retaining the higher boiling point heat stable salts. When the kettleliquids become saturated at a constant boiling point with the degradation productsit is shut in and dumped to the drain. Union Carbide has developed a well provencorrosion inhibitor system for MEA that allows solution strengths of 28–32%. Theinhibitor requires payment of a royalty. The inhibitor chemicals are both expensiveand hazardous for personnel to handle. The system does reduce corrosion problems tonearly zero and allows much higher system capacity for the same size equipment. Inaddition to the chemical degradation mentioned above, MEA oxidizes when exposedto air. Storage and surge tanks must be provided with inert blanket gases such as N
2
or sweet natural gas to avoid this degradation.
Amine systems foam rather easily resulting in excessive amine carryover in the con-
tactor. Foaming can be caused by solids such as carbon or iron sulﬁde; condensedhydrocarbon liquids from the gas stream; degradation products; almost any foreignmaterial introduced to the system such as valve grease, excess corrosion inhibitor, etc.Some of these items such as iron sulﬁde or carbon particles are removed by cartridgeﬁlters. Hydrocarbon liquids are usually removed by the use of a carbon bed ﬁlter on alean amine sidestream (about 10% of total ﬂow). Corrosion byproducts are removedby reclaiming as noted above.
High skin temperatures on the reboiler/reclaimer tubes promote amine degradation.
Steam or hot oil used for the reboiler should be limited to a maximum of 285
◦F
(140◦C) to avoid excessive temperatures. The reclaimer should not see hot oil or
steam above 415◦F (213◦C).
MEA is nonselective in absorbing acid gases. It will absorb H 2S faster than CO 2but
the difference is not signiﬁcant enough to allow its use to separate them. With thelowest molecular weight of the common amines, it has a greater carrying capacity forREFINER Y GAS TREATING PROCESSES 421
acid gases on a unit weight or volume basis. This generally means less pure amine
circulation to remove a given amount of acid gases.
Because the solvent is in solution with water, the gas with which it comes in intimate
contact will leave the contactor at its water saturation point. If dehydration is necessaryit must be done after the MEA system.
MEA has a vapor pressure 30 times that of DEA (300 times that of TEA and DGA) at
the same temperature. This causes MEA losses of 1 to 3 lbs/mmscf compared to 1/4 to1/2 lb/mmscf for the other amine systems using the same system design parameters.Entrainment and leakage losses prevent low vapor pressure amines from attaining thepredicted losses.
Diethanol amineDEA does not degrade when contacted with CS
2, COS, and mercaptans as does MEA.
However for product gas streams which must meet lower than 1 grain per scf of H 2S,
MEA must be used. Because of this, DEA has been developed as a preferred solvent
when these chemicals are present in the stream to be treated.
The reaction with acid gas for any of the amines is a mole to mole reaction. As shown
in Table 10.1 the molecular weight of DEA is 1.7 times that of MEA. Even aftercorrecting for density it requires 1.6 lb of DEA to react with the same amount of acidgas as 1 lb of MEA."
"DEA is a weaker base (less reactive) than MEA. This has allowed DEA to be circulated
at about twice the solution strength of MEA without corrosion problems. DEA systemsare commonly operated at strengths up to 30 wt% in water and it is not unusual tosee them as high as 35 wt%. This results in the DEA solution circulation rate usuallybeing a little less than MEA for the same system design parameters.
The process reactions are shown below.

Diglycol amine
This process has been developed by the Fluor Company. It originally began as a
combination of 15% MEA, 80% triethylene glycol, 5% water. The system wouldboth sweeten and dehydrate (to the same level as 95% TEG) the gas in a singlestep. The high vapor release during regeneration (both water vapors and acid gases)causes severe erosion/corrosion problems in the amine/amine exchanger and in theregeneration column. This system has generally been abandoned.REFINER Y GAS TREATING PROCESSES 423
The present system uses 2-(2-amono ethoxy) ethanol at a recommended solution
strength of 60 wt% in water. DGA has almost the same molecular weight as DEAand reacts mole for mole with acid gases. DGA seams to tie up acid gases moreeffectively so that the higher concentration of acid gas per gallon of solution does notcause corrosion problems as experienced with the usual amine systems.
The system reactions are given below.

DGA does react with COS and mercaptans similarly to MEA but forms N, N1, bis
(hydroxy, ethoxy ethyl) urea, BHEEU. BHEEU can only be detected using an infra-
red test rather than chromatography. Normal operating levels of 2–4% BHEEU arecarried in the DGA without corrosion problems. BHEEU is removed by the use ofa reclaimer identical to that for an MEA system but operated at 385
◦F (196◦C).
Materials of construction are the same as those for MEA systems.
There has been a concern that DGA might be a good solvent for unsaturated hydro-
carbons. A survey of the DGA users indicates that many of the systems are operatedon gas containing concentrations of C
5+above 2% without any indication of hydro-
carbon loading of the system.
Those systems near their hydrocarbon dew point are usually installed with a ﬂash tank
on the rich amine from the absorber. The ﬂash tank is operated at a reduced pressurejust high enough to get into the plant fuel gas system. It reduces the vapor load on theregenerator column. (A similar system is recommended on MEA systems operatingnear the hydrocarbon dew point.)
DGA allows H
2S removal to less than 1/4 grain per 100 scf and removes CO 2to levels
of about 200 ppm using normal absorber design parameters.
Other gas treating processes
Hot potassium carbonate (Benﬁeld)The basic process concept has been known since the early 1900s. It was not an
economical, practically demonstrated process until the mid 1950s. Since that time the424 CHAPTER 10
process has been used for bulk removal of acid gases where residual CO 2content was
not needed in the ppm range.
The process is very similar to the amine processes. High temperatures favor high
solubility of potassium carbonate (PC) in water leading to high concentrations of PC.High PC concentrations mean higher carrying capacity of acid gases in the system.
The system is ideal for streams having CO
2partial pressures of 30–90 psi (205–620"
"kPa). It has a high afﬁnity for H 2S so that pipeline speciﬁcation for H 2S can easily be
reached at about 4 ppm. A stream with little or no CO 2is not suited for the process
due to making regeneration of the lean PC extremely difﬁcult.This process is usually found as part of the hydrogen plant in those reﬁneries that
need to produce hydrogen.
SulﬁnolThis is a proprietary system developed by Shell Oil Company. The process uses
a solution containing both a chemically reactive component, Di-isopropanolamine(DIPA) and a physical solvent, Tetra hydro thiophene 1-1 dioxide (sulfolane).
Sulfolane is a very active solvent for H
2S, COS and the mercaptans. CO 2is also
soluble in it, but not nearly as much as the S compounds are. Because of this, sulﬁnol
systems are most economically attractive (compared to amine systems) for H 2S/CO 2
ratios greater than 1:1. If the bulk of the acid gas can be dissolved in the sulfolanethe system is much cheaper to operate than amine. The acid gases are picked up andreleased with very little heat increase or heat required. The solubility of acid gases ismuch higher in sulﬁnol than for the amines. Sulﬁnol loading are limited to 4–6 scfacid gas/gal solvent versus 2.5 scf acid gas/gal amine solution. In addition the heatcapacity of sulfolane is about half that of the amines, further reducing the regenerationheat required.
Other, sweetening liquid processes such as Vetracoke, Stretford, and Rectisol have
found high usage in the coal gasiﬁcation and natural gas industries. They have notreached the prominence of the amines or the PC processes in oil reﬁning. Table 10.1summarizes a comparison of the common solvents.
Calculating the amine circulation rate
The circulation rate for amine solvents is important to ensure effective treatment of
the sour gas. It is important also because it is a major contribution to the operatingcost of the plant. These costs are incurred by pumping cost, steam to reboiler andREFINER Y GAS TREATING PROCESSES 425
air cooler/condenser costs. This item provides a calculation method to establish this
circulating rate. It is based on some ﬁxed parameters which have been accepted asthe optimum. These steps are:
Step 1. In DEA and MEA treating processes a ratio of the amine to H
2S is about 3:1
mole.
Step 2. Obtain gas feed rate and its composition (from plant and lab tests). Determine
its mole weight and the volume percent H 2S.
Step 3. Fix the weight percent of amine in the recirculating amine solution. This will
be between 15% and 20% weight of DEA or MEA in water.
Step 4. Calculate the H 2S in moles/hr that is in the feed. This is done by resolving
volume ﬂow of gas to moles and using lab data to provide moles/hr of H 2S.
Step 5. Calculate the amount of H 2S to be left in the lean gas. This is usually
10 grains/100 SCF with DEA as absorbent and 3 grains/100 set with MEA as
absorbent (1 grain =0.0648 g or 0.0022857 ounces).
Step 6. Calculate H 2S absorbed. This is the difference between Step 4 and Step 5.
Step 7. Using the ratio 3:1 ﬁxed in Step 1 calculate the rate of DEA (or MEA) that
will be required.
Step 8. Mole weight of DEA is 105.1 and the mole weight of MEA is 61.1. Calculate
weight of the amine using percent weight of amine in solution calculate weight perunit time of solution.
Step 9. Using the data from step 2 calculate the solution’ s gallons per hour or per
minute.
Calculating the number of theoretical trays in an amine contactor
There are several accepted methods to calculate theoretical trays in amine contactors.
Among these are the McCabe Thiele— Graphical Method and the calculation methoddescribed by the following steps. This calculation method is considered by manyto be the sounder and more accurate of the methods available. The following stepsdescribes this calculation procedure:
Step 1. The equation to determine the number of theoretical trays is:
N=(Log 1/q ( A−1))
(Log A)−(1)
where
N=number of theoretical trays
q=mole H 2S in lean gas/mole H 2S in feed gas
A=the absorption factor L/V ·K
Step 2. Calculate H 2S in lean gas in moles/hr and moles H 2S in the rich gas. Divide
H2S in lean gas by that in the feed. This is q.426 CHAPTER 10

Step 4. Using the grains/hr of H 2S leaving in the richer amine (that is grains in
feed gas less grain in product gas), calculate grains per gallon absorbed by amine
solution. Add to that value the H 2S residual in the lean amine. The sum of these
is the grains of H 2S per gallon of amine, and is the value used in Figure 10.2 to
determine the partial pressure of H 2S in MEA.REFINER Y GAS TREATING PROCESSES 427"

Step 6. Solve for A. Then solve equation given in Step 1 for N. Divide Nby efﬁciency
factor (usually about 15% for absorbers) to determine actual number of trays.
An example calculation is given in Appendix 10.1 of this chapter.
Calculating absorber tray size and design
This procedure is similar to those described in other sections of this Handbook.
Emphasis is made here, however, to the foaming tendencies of MEA and DEA. Most ofthese units contain facilities to inject anti-foaming chemicals. Under normal operationthese chemicals subdue foaming to a large extent particularly in the contactors. Theaddition of a ﬁlter in the rich amine line also helps combat severe foaming.
It is believed that foaming is enhanced by the absorption of large quantities of hy-
drocarbons into the amine stream. This can occur quite easily if the temperature orpressure change forces the hydrocarbon gas into a condition below its dew point. Thepresence of large quantities of impurities such as COS (Carbonyl Sulﬁde) or the tarryderivative of COS may also induce foaming. The addition of the ﬁlter and reclaimerusually solves this problem to a large extent.
Loading of amine towers nevertheless is critical due to the foaming nature. Conse-
quently the towers are designed with more latitude than most other towers. In evalu-ating its performance also the acceptable level of ﬂooding is lower by 20–30% thanthat for normal towers.
The calculation to evaluate the towers ﬂooding follows the same steps as those de-
scribed in Chapter 4. In this case, however, the calculated value for V
Lis multiplied
by a system factor between 20% and 30%. If the unit is being used in service wherehigh concentration of impurities is present a ﬁgure of 30% should be used.
Calculating the heat transfer area for the lean/rich amine exchanger
The amine in the contactor picks up the heat of reaction which occurs with the
absorption of H
2S. On leaving the amine contactor or absorber the rich amine is heat
exchanged against hot lean amine leaving the bottom of the stripper. The performanceof this exchanger is critical to the process as a whole. Usually the rich amine receivesno other heat before it enters the stripper. As in light end towers the feed conditionis vital to the proper operation of the tower. The purpose of this item is to provide acalculation procedure to evaluate the heat transfer coefﬁcient of this exchanger. Thefollowing steps gives the procedure:
Step 1. Using lab data for operational units or the design speciﬁcation for those units
to be designed, determine the quantity of H
2S absorbed in the contactor.REFINER Y GAS TREATING PROCESSES 429

amine entering.
Step 4. Carry out a heat balance over the contactor with the rich amine temperature

The stripper design and performance
This evaluation is based on reconciling the steam used for stripping the rich amine. The
quantity of steam is a major operating cost in this type of plant and therefore deservesattention. An acceptable level of steam usage is about 0.8–1.1 lbs steam/gallon ofcirculating solution for MEA and 1.1–1.3 lbs steam/gallon in the case of DEA. Thisitem describes a procedure to calculate this steam rate.430 CHAPTER 10
Step 1. From plant data design speciﬁcation ascertain the feed rate of rich amine
to the stripper, and its composition in terms of H 2S, water, MEA (or DEA), and
hydrocarbons."
"Step 2. Calculate recycle rate of lean amine leaving the bottom of the tower. Obtain
from the lab data or design speciﬁcation its composition in terms of residual H 2S,
water, MEA (or DEA) and hydrocarbon (if any).
Step 3. Develop the material balance over the tower.
Step 4. Using the data in Step 3 set the external tower top reﬂux ratio as 2:1, and
calculate the heat balance over the tower top to ﬁnd the condenser duty.
Step 5. Calculate the heat in with the rich amine feed before the preheat exchangers
(see previous item).
Step 6. Using plant data for lean amine temperature in and out of the preheat ex-
changers calculate its duty. Add the duty to the enthalpy from Step 5 to give feed
enthalpy into the tower.
Step 7. Calculate the overall heat balance over the stripper to ﬁnd the reboiler duty.
Remember to add in heat of dissociation which is equal to the heat of reaction inthe contactor (See previous item).
Step 8. Saturated 50 psig steam is usually used as the heating medium. Calculate the
amount of steam from its enthalpy data (steam tables) and the reboiler duty.
Step 9. If the steam usage is excessive check overhead stream and the lean amine
concentration. It is possible that a high volume of water is being evaporated. If thisis the case reduce the reboiler duty to maintain the amine concentration and H
2S
concentration.
Removing degradation impurities from MEA
Although MEA (mono ethanol amine) is the most efﬁcient absorbent in the amine
family. It has one major shortcoming. It is readily degraded by certain sulfur com-pounds such as carbonyl sulﬁde (COS) and by carbon disulphides. Both these com-pounds are found in signiﬁcant quantities in gases from cracking processes such asthermal crackers and catalytic crackers.
It is difﬁcult if not impossible under normal reﬁnery conditions to remove these
sulﬁdes from the gas. What can be done and is the normal practice is to removethe product of degradation and return the ‘ clean’amine to the system. Two items ofequipment are added to the process to achieve this. These are a ﬁlter and a reclaimer.The ﬁlter is a normal leaf type ﬁlter contained in two ﬁlter casings. These are pipedup in parallel with one on stream and the other shut down for cleaning and as spare.
Reclaimers are really kettle type reboilers. It takes as feed a portion of the lean amine
leaving the stripper. This stream is vaporized and the vapor returned to the strippingREFINER Y GAS TREATING PROCESSES 431
tower. The residue or sludge is the product of degradation and is dumped to waste.
Reclaimers can be designed to operate continuously or on a batch basis. Steam isused as the heating medium. As in the case of the stripper reboilers the heating steamtemperature to the reclaimer is also carefully controlled. Thus the steam medium issaturated 50 psig steam. It must be remembered that the duty to condense the vaporizedamine from the reclaimer must be added to the stripper overhead condenser duty. Itmust also be included in any tower loading exercise that may follow.

The following is an extract from a design speciﬁcation and deﬁnes the parameters of
this example:

recycle gas stream. The feed to the hydrotreater consists of gas oil from straight
run source and streams from a thermal cracker and a catalytic cracker.The recycle gas will therefore contain some COS.

rThe pressure of the gas at the outlet of the contactor is 320 psig.
3.0 Product gas shall have a H 2S content of no greater than 0.1 grain/100 scf.
4.0 The amine solvent to be used shall be mono ethanol amine.
rAmine ratio to H 2S shall be 3.0 moles amine to 1.0 mole H 2S.
rThe amine solution shall be 20% by weight in water.

The heat of reaction is calculated at 650 Btu/lb of H 2S absorbed.
The lean amine solution enters at a temperature of 105◦F which will be set by heat
transfer. The lean product gas will leave at about the same temperature.The rich amine leaving the contactor is determined by difference

The heat exchanger designThe hot lean amine stream to the contactor will be cooled from the stripper bottom
temperature ﬁrst by heat exchange against the rich amine leaving the contactor. Itwill then be trim cooled to the contactor inlet temperature by either water or air.The following is the calculation to determine the size of the lean/rich amine ex-changer.
The lean amine from the stripper will be cooled to 175
◦F in the heat exchange with
the rich amine leaving the contactor. The duty of this exchanger is:
{38,949 ×0.663×(249−175)}+(155,798 ×74)=13.44 mmBtu/hr
The ﬁgure 240◦F is a value for the stripper bottom temperature estimated by a quick
bubble point calculation of the lean amine at the stripper bottom conditions of tem-
perature and pressure. This will be checked later.
Temperature of the rich amine feed to the stripper ( T) is as follows:

The stripper bottom conditions and reboiler duty
The pressure at the bottom of the tower is ﬁxed at 34 psia. This allows a pressure dropof about 0.35 psi per tray which is estimated as a total of 20 trays. The tower bottomtemperature is calculated by a bubble point calculation of the bottom product at thispressure of 34 psia (see Table 10.7).
Enthalpy of bottom product =230 Btu/lb as liquid.
Calculating the reboiler duty
This is determined from the overall tower heat balance as shown in Table 10.8.

"The V/L factor calculated above will be used for this equation. A Tower average K
value for each component in the feed will also be used. The equation is shown by
Table 10.10.
Three theoretical trays will achieve the stripping required. Stripping trays have poor ef-
ﬁciency between 12% and 18%. Use 15% in this case, then actual trays will be 3/.15 =
20 actual trays.
The anomaly for the amount of HC stripped in the above calculation stems from the
assumption that the HC is pentane. It is probably a heavier hydrocarbon.
Calculating the reclaimer duty and size
A slip stream of 2 wt% of lean amine solution will be routed through the reclaimer. Itwill be vaporized to leave a sludge stream of 2% of the reclaimer feed. The operationwill be continuous and the vapor will be routed back to the tower entering below thebottom tray. The material balance over the reclaimer is shown in Table 10.11.

Upgrading the ‘Bottom of the Barrel’
D.S.J. Jones
The highest yield of straight run product as a percentage on crude is the residue
from the atmospheric distillation of the crude feed. In most Middle East crudes thisranges from around 40 vol% for the lighter crude oils to 50% and higher in case ofthe heavier oils. It can be, and often is, the major factor in crude oil slate selectionand in the operation of the reﬁnery itself. In most cases a large portion of the residuecan be blended off to meet the fuel oil product in the reﬁnery’ s production plan. Inother cases, perhaps equally as common, a major portion of the atmospheric residue isfurther distilled, under vacuum, to distillates which can be processed to meet gasolineand middle distillate product slates or lube oil blending stocks. The residue from thisvacuum distillation, now considerably smaller in volume, is routed to fuel oil or to abitumen product pool.
There are cases however where the quantities of both atmospheric and vacuum residues
are high enough to limit the reﬁnery’ s throughput or limit its production of the morevaluable products and thus limit the reﬁnery’ s proﬁtability. In such cases, the conver-sion of these residues becomes attractive, and, in some cases absolutely imperative.This latter case refers to those reﬁneries that have no or a very small fuel oil market.The upgrading of these residues is accomplished by the indirect processing of theatmospheric residue, processing the distillates, by catalytic cracking or hydrocrack-ing and then thermally cracking the vacuum residue. Most of the processes involvedwith the conversion of the vacuum distillates are described in other chapters of thisHandbook dealing with hydrocracking and ﬂuid catalytic cracking.
Direct upgrading of the atmospheric residue by the thermal cracking processes has
long been the ‘ work horse’of the industry in processing the ‘ Bottom of the Barrel’ .
However, some catalytic processes have been developed which demonstrate a moreefﬁcient and effective method than the thermal cracking routes. This chapter dealswith the direct processing of crude oil residuum, and is divided into the followingparts:

The thermal cracking processes
Thermal cracking processes refer to those that convert the residuum feed (whether
atmospheric or vacuum residues) into higher grade products such as naphtha andmiddle distillates, by heat at high temperature alone. That is, no catalyst or chemicalsare used in the conversion. The processes themselves are:
rVisbreaking
rThermal cracking
rCoking
Certain confusion exists in the deﬁnition of visbreaking and thermal cracking. Dif-ferentiation is based on the type of feedstock, severity of cracking or the ﬁnal result.Strictly speaking, the term visbreaking should refer strictly to the viscosity reductionof heavy stock as the process’ s main objective.
Applications of the thermal cracker processesIn a simple reﬁnery, without vacuum distillation facilities, the residue from the crude
oil atmospheric distillation typically boiling above 650
◦Fo r7 0 0◦F constitutes the
bulk of the heavy fuel oil produced. In cases where incremental production of lightand middle distillates at the expense of fuel oil is desired, one stage thermal crackingof the residue is an easy and cost effective solution. The residue is cracked in aspecially designed heater, the efﬂuent from the heater is quenched and routed to afractionator, sometimes with a pre-ﬂash and the products of cracking such as lightgases, naphtha, gas oil, and residue are separated in the conventional manner. Some20% of the residue feed can be converted into lighter products, mostly gas oil, by thisprocess. Figure 11.1 shows a typical one stage thermal cracker.
For increased gas oil production, a somewhat more complicated scheme can be ap-
plied. The residue feed in this case is ﬁrst cracked in the heater and the efﬂuent ﬂashed,the hot vapors from the ﬂash drum are routed to a fractionating tower where a heavygas oil is recovered as the bottom product. This is, in turn, cracked in a second heaterand under more severe conditions to yield additional quantities of light distillate prod-ucts and gas oil. Typically the ﬁrst, residue, heater is operated at 15–20 psig and a coiloutlet temperature of 900
◦F . The second, gas oil, heater operates at around 250–300"
"psig and a coil outlet temperature of 930◦F . This process is a two stage thermal cracker
and is shown as Figure 11.2.UPGRADING RESIDUES 449
Figure 11.1. One stage thermal cracker.
The visbreaker process
The visbreaker process conﬁguration is very similar to the single stage thermal cracker
as shown in Figure 11.1. More often than not though an additional piece of equipmentis added immediately after the heater. This is a simple soaking drum which prolongsthe time the heater efﬂuent remains at the cracking temperature without being sub-jected to further heat input and temperature. The objective here is to maintain goodfuel oil stability while still converting sufﬁcient of the feed to gas oil and thus loweringthe residue viscosity to fuel oil speciﬁcation. By providing a soaker drum suitable con-version is obtained by residence time at moderate temperature and pressure conditions

without impairing the resulting fuel oil stability. Visbreaker heater outlet temperature
can be as low as 830◦F to meet viscosity speciﬁcation. This process conﬁguration is
shown as Figure 11.3.
The coking processes
Coking is the most severe form of thermal cracking, in which all the residue feed
is converted into light ends, naphtha, middle distillate, and a solid material, coke.No residual fuel oil is left. This process is particularly useful in handling very heavycrudes such as Bachequero or the Canadian ‘ Heavy Oil’ crudes. A suitable market forthe coke must be found, and coke quality requirements may impose further processingsuch as calcining with, of course, a resulting additional cost.
Two major types of coking processes are in operation today, these are the delayed
coking process and the ﬂuid coking process. The intricacies, delicate operation andcost of the conventional ﬂuid process makes it an unlikely contender when simpleand cheap ways to convert residues into more valuable products are desired. A fairlyrecent development of the ﬂuid coking process, however, allows for the conversion ofthe coke into low Btu gas. Only the delayed coking process and a proprietary processfor Fluid coking will be discussed here.
Delayed coking process
The delayed coking process is illustrated by Figure 11.4.
The fuel oil or heavy oil feed is routed to a cracking furnace similar to other thermal
cracking processes. The efﬂuent from the furnace is sent to one of a set of severalUPGRADING RESIDUES 451

coking drums without quenching. The efﬂuent is normally at a coil outlet temperature
of around 920◦F and at a pressure of 30–50 psig and the coking drum is ﬁlled in about
24 hr. The vapors leaving the top of the drum whilst ﬁlling are routed to the fractionator,where they are fractionated to the distillate products. The very long residence periodof the efﬂuent in the coking drums results in the complete destruction of the heavyfractions, and a solid residue rich in carbon is left in the drum as coke.
When the drum is full of coke it is cooled and the top and bottom of the drum are
opened. Special high pressure water jets are used to cut and remove the coke throughthe drum’ s bottom opening.
The following table gives a rough comparison of yields from the various thermal
cracking processes. The two stage thermal cracker as shown in Figure 11.2 is consid-ered in Table 11.1.

Flexi-coking (ﬂuid-coking)
Flexi-coking is a thermal conversion process licensed by Exxon Research and Engi-
neering Company. The process itself is an extension of the traditional ﬂuid cokingprocess. The extension allows for the gasiﬁcation of the major portion of the cokemake to produce a low Btu gas. The gasiﬁcation step follows closely to the conceptused in the coal gasiﬁcation processes.
Figure 11.5 below is a simpliﬁed ﬂow diagram of the ﬂexi-coking process.
Heavy residuum feed is introduced into the reactor vessel where it is thermally cracked.The heat for cracking is supplied by a ﬂuidized bed of hot coke transferred to thereactor from the heater vessel. The vapor products of the reaction leave the reactorzone to enter the scrubber section. Fine coke and some of the heavy oil particles areremoved from the cracked products in the scrubber zone and returned to mix with thefresh feed entering the reactor. The reactor products subsequently leave the scrubberand are routed to a conventional fractionating facility. Steam is introduced to thebottom of the reactor to maintain a ﬂuid bed of coke and to strip the excess cokeleaving the reactor free from entrained oil.

The coke leaving the reactor enters the heater vessel, where sufﬁcient coke is converted
into CO/CO 2in the presence of air. This conversion of the coke provides the heat for
cracking which is subsequently transmitted to the reactor by a hot coke stream. The netcoke make leaves the heater and enters the gasiﬁer vessel. Air and steam are introducedinto the gasiﬁer to react with the coke producing a low Btu gas consisting predomi-nately of hydrogen, CO, CO
2, and nitrogen. This gas together with some excess air is
transferred to the heater, and leaves this vessel to be suitably cleaned and cooled.
Flexi-coking is an extinctive process. By continuous recycle of heavy oil stream all
the feed is converted into distillate fractions, reﬁnery gas, and low Btu gas. There isa very small coke purge stream which amounts to about 0.4–0.8 wt% of fresh feed.When suitably hydrotreated the fractionated streams from the ﬂexi-coker provide goodquality products. Hydrotreated coker naphtha provides an excellent high-naphthenefeed to the catalytic reformer. Typical yields from a ﬂexi-coker based on Arabianresidue are shown in Table 11.2.
This process is quite ﬂexible as to the quality of the feedstock, most of the metals are
removed with the coke purge. Condradson carbon content of the feed does not affectthe yield as may be expected. Where an economic use can be found for the low Btugas, the process offers an attractive route for upgrading low quality fuel oil.
The principles of and correlations associated with thermal cracking processes
The soaking volume concept
The design of a thermal cracker is keyed to the conﬁguration and temperature pro-ﬁle across the heater and soaking drum or soaking coil. The degree of cracking is454 CHAPTER 11
dependant on this temperature proﬁle and the residence time of the oil under these
conditions.
The thermal cracking reaction is accepted as being of the ﬁrst order thus it complies
with the equation:
In (conv) =(A)e−E/RT×t
where
A,E,R=constants
t=reaction time
T=reaction temperature
The thermal cracking reaction occurs in the heater along a curve of increasing tem-perature. In this concept of design the cracking progression is expressed by a soakingvolume factor (SVF) which is deﬁned by the following equation:
F=1/D/integraldisplay
v
0Ps
Po·Kt
K0dv
where
V=coil volume
D=feed rate
Kt=reaction rate constant at any given temperature
KoPo=standard reference value for KtandPt
Pt=pressure at a given point in coil
The standard reference temperature for thermal cracking is taken as 800◦F . A curve
giving value of Kt/Koat a typical thermal cracking heater is given in Figure 11.6.
The curve was produced from experimental results using a normal accepted pressuredrop proﬁle across the heater. For simplicity the curve is related to temperature versusthe factor K
t/K800◦F.
The soaking volume factor
The soaking volume factor (SVF) is related to product yields and the degree of
conversion. Deﬁnition of these items are:
rThe degree of conversionThe relationship of the soaking volume factor to the degree of conversion is given byFigure 11.7. These curves were the result of experimental data from the laboratorycracking of many feedstocks.

"rThe zone of critical decomposition
Experimental data shows that cracking and stability of the cracked product varieswith the characteristics of the crude source material and boiling range. Figure11.10 demonstrates this criteria as a relationship with the Watson characterizationfactor ‘ K’of the feed stock.
The shaded area of the ﬁgure is the range in which the major portion of cracking occurs.Above this area the cracked residue becomes unstable and precipitates sediment whenstored. It is undesirable to operate above this zone in most cases where a crackedresidue is required.
Discussion of the concept
This is not a new concept for it has certainly been accepted as a basis for designsince the late 1950s. To date there are at least six visbreakers and/or thermal crackersto the author’ s knowledge that were designed using these parameters and are still incommercial use. In evaluating this concept, it is interesting to note the following testrun data compared with that calculated using SVF concept (Table 11.3).458 CHAPTER 11

It can be seen that the data calculated compare well with those actually observed
under test conditions. One interesting point in the test run data is the high coil outlettemperature that was used. As this is slightly above the critical decomposition zonefor this type of crude it would lend one to suspect that the cracked residue would beunstable. There was no recorded evidence of this however.
An example calculation using the SVF concept is given as Appendix 11.1 of this
chapter.

During the late 1980s signiﬁcant research and development breakthroughs produced
a catalytic process that can handle residuum feed.
Feed stocks heavier than vacuum gas oil when in conventional FCCU tend to increase
the production of coke and this in turn deactivates the catalyst. This is mainly theresult of:
rA high portion of the feed that does not vaporize. The unvaporized portion quicklycokes on the catalyst choking its active area.460 CHAPTER 11

rThe presence of high concentrations of polar molecules such as poly cyclic aromatics
and nitrogen compounds. These are absorbed into the catalyst’ s active area causinginstant (but temporary) deactivation.
rHeavy metals that poison the catalyst and affect the selectivity of the crackingprocess.
rHigh concentration of poly-naphthenes that dealkylate slowly.
In FCCU that process conventional feedstocks cracking temperature is controlledby the circulation of hot regenerated catalyst. With the heavier feedstocks, with anincrease in Conradson carbon, there will be a larger coke formation. This in turnproduces a high regenerated catalyst temperature and heat load. To maintain heatbalance therefore catalyst circulation is reduced leading to poor or unsatisfactoryperformance. Catalyst cooling or feed cooling is used to overcome this high catalystheat load and to maintain proper circulation.
The extended boiling range of the feed, as in the case of residues, tends to cause an
uneven cracking severity. The lighter molecules in the feed are instantly vaporizedon contact with the hot catalyst, and cracking occurs. In the case of the heaviermolecules vaporization is not achieved so easily. This contributes to a higher cokedeposition with a higher rate of catalyst deactivation. Ideally, the whole feed shouldbe instantly vaporized so that uniform cracking mechanism can commence. The mix
temperature (which is deﬁned as the theoretical equilibrium temperature between the"
"uncracked vaporized feed and the regenerated catalyst) should be close to the feedUPGRADING RESIDUES 461
dew point temperature. In conventional units this is about 20–30◦C above the riser
outlet temperature. This can be approximated by the expression
TM=TR+0.1/Delta1 HC
where
TM=the mix temperature
TR=riser outlet temperature◦C
/Delta1HC=heat of cracking in kJ/kg
This mix temperature is also slightly dependent on the catalyst temperature.
Cracking severity is affected by poly cyclic aromatics and nitrogen. This is so because
these compounds tend to be absorbed into the catalyst. Rising the mix temperatureby increasing the riser temperature reverses the absorption process. Unfortunately, ahigher riser temperature leads to undesirable thermal cracking and production of drygas.
The processing of residual feedstocks therefore requires special techniques to over-
come:
rFeed vaporization
rHigh concentration of polar molecules
rPresence of metals
Some of the techniques developed to meet heavy oil cracking processing are as fol-lows:
rTwo stage regeneration
rRiser mixer design and mix temperature control (MTC) (for rapid vaporization)
rNew riser lift technology minimizing the use of steam
rRegenerated catalyst temperature control (catalyst cooling)
rCatalyst selection for:
➢Good conversion and yield pattern
➢Metal resistance
➢Thermal and hydro-thermal resistance
➢High gasoline RON
These are discussed in the following items.
Conventional ﬂuid catalytic crackers can be revamped to incorporate the features
necessary for heavy oil (residual) cracking. World wide, there were approximatelysome 23 FCC residue units in operation (to the beginning of 1992), having a totalprocessing capacity of 760,000 BD.462 CHAPTER 11
Figure 11.11. Two stage catalyst regeneration.
Two stage regeneration and regenerated catalyst temperature control
An important issue in the case of deep oil (residue) cracking is the handling of the
high coke lay down and the protection of the catalyst. One technique that limits thesevere conditions in regeneration of the spent catalyst is the two stage regeneration.Figure 11.11 shows the layout of such a regenerator.
The spent catalyst from the reactor is delivered to the ﬁrst regeneration. Here the
catalyst undergoes a mild oxidation with a limited amount of air. Temperatures in thisregeneration remain fairly low around 700–750
◦C range. From this ﬁrst regeneration
the catalyst is pneumatically conveyed to a second regenerator. Here excess air is usedto complete the carbon burn off and temperatures up to 900
◦C are experienced. The
regenerated catalyst leaves this second regeneration to return to the reactor via the riser.
The technology that applies to the two stage regeneration process is innovative in that
it achieves the burning off of the high coke without impairing the catalyst activity.In the ﬁrst stage the conditions encourage the combustion of most of the hydrogenassociated with the coke. A signiﬁcant amount of the carbon is also burned off undermild condition. These conditions inhibit catalyst deactivation.
All the residual coke is burned off in the second stage with excess air and in a
dry atmosphere. All the steam associated with hydrogen combustion and carry overUPGRADING RESIDUES 463

from the reactor has been dispensed within the ﬁrst stage. The second regenerator
is refractory lined and there is no temperature constraint. The catalyst is allowed tocome to equilibrium. Even at high regenerator temperatures under these conditionslower catalyst deactivation is experienced. The two stage regeneration technique leadsto a better catalyst regeneration as well as a lower catalyst consumption. Typically theclean catalyst contains less than 0.05 wt% of carbon. This is achieved with an overalllower heat of combustion. See Figures 11.12 and 11.13.
Since the unit remains in heat balance coke production stays essentially the same.
The circulation rate of catalyst adjusts itself to any changes in coke deposition on thecatalyst according to the expressions:
coke make =delta coke +c/o
and
regenerator temperature =riser temperature +C×delta coke
where
delta coke =difference between the weight fraction of coke
on the catalyst before and after regeneration.
C=unit constant (typically 180–230)
c/o=catalyst to oil ratio
In this regard a small circulation of extremely hot catalyst may not be as effectiveas a large circulation of cooler catalyst. It has been found that there is a speciﬁccatalyst temperature range that is desirable for a given feed and catalyst system. A464 CHAPTER 11

unique dense phase catalyst cooling system provides a technique through which the
best temperature and heat balance relationship can be maintained.
Consider the enthalpy requirements for a FCC reactor given in Table 11.4.It can be seen from this table that 69% of the enthalpy contained in the heat input to"
"the reactor is required just to heat and vaporize the feed. The remainder is essentiallyavailable for conversion. To improve conversion it would be very desirable to allowmore of the heat available to be used for conversion. The only variable that canbe changed to achieve this requirement is the feed inlet enthalpy. That is throughpreheating the feed. Doing this, however, immediately reduces the catalyst circulationrate to maintain heat balance. This of course has an adverse effect on conversion. The

preheating of the feed can, however, be compensated for by cooling the catalyst. Thus,
the catalyst circulation rate can be retained and in many cases can be increased. Indeed,by careful manipulation of the heat balance the net increase in catalyst circulation ratecan be as high as 1 unit cat/oil ratio. The higher equilibrium catalyst activity possibleat the lower regeneration temperature also improves the unit yield pattern. This isdemonstrated in Table 11.5.
In summary, catalyst cooling will:
rslightly increase unit coke
rgive a higher plant catalyst activity
rbe able to handle more contaminated feeds
rimprove conversion and unit yield
rprovide better operating ﬂexibility
In resid cracking commercial experience indicates that operations at regenerated
catalyst temperatures above 1,350
◦F result in poor yields with high gas production.
Where certain operations require high regen temperatures the installation of a catalystcooler will have a substantial economic incentive. This will be due to improved yieldsand catalyst consumption.
There are two types of catalyst coolers available. These are:
rthe back mix type
rﬂow through type
These are shown in Figure 11.14. Both coolers are installed into the dense phase
section of the regenerator.466 CHAPTER 11
Figure 11.14. Typical catalyst coolers.
The back mix cooler. Boiler feed water ﬂows tube side in both cooler types. The
catalyst in the back mix cooler circulates around the tube bundle on the shell side.
The heat transfer takes place in a dense low velocity region so erosion is minimized.The back mix cooler can remove approximately 50 million Btus/hr.
The flow through cooler. As the name suggests the catalyst ﬂows once through on
the shell side of this cooler. Again erosion is minimized by low velocity operation in
the dense phase. This type of cooler is more efﬁcient than the backmix. This unit canachieve heat removal as high as 100 million Btus per hr.
Mix temperature control and lift gas technology
The equilibrium temperature between the oil feed and the regenerated catalyst must
be reached in the shortest possible time. This is required in order to ensure the rapidand homogeneous vaporization of the feed. To ensure this it is necessary to design andinstall a proper feed injection system. This system should ensure that any catalyst backmixing is eliminated. It should also ensure that all the vaporized feed components aresubject to the same cracking severity.
Efﬁcient mixing of the feed ﬁnely atomized in small droplets is achieved by contact
with a pre-accelerated dilute suspension of the regenerated catalyst. Under theseconditions feed vaporization takes place almost instantaneously. This conﬁgurationis shown in the diagram below:UPGRADING RESIDUES 467

STEAM OR LIFT GAS
The regenerated catalyst stream from the regenerator is accelerated by steam or lift
gas injection to move up the riser. The oil feed is introduced atomized by steam intothe catalyst environment. The main motive steam into the riser is introduced below thefeed inlet point. Good mixing occurs in this section with maximum contact betweenoil, catalyst and the steam.
In residue cracking the proper selection of catalyst enables even the most bulky
molecules to reach the active catalyst zone. Catalysts such as zeolites have a highsilica to alumina ratio which cracks the heavy molecules into sizes that can enter theactive zone.
Efﬁcient mixing of the catalyst and feed together with the catalyst selection ensures:
rRapid vaporization of the oil
rUniform cracking severity of the oil
Another problem that is met within residue cracking is the possibility of the heavier"
"portion of the oil being below its dew point. To ensure this is overcome the “ mixtemperature” (see previous item) must be set above the dew point of the feed. As statedearlier the presence of poly cyclic aromatics also affects cracking severity. Increasingthe mix temperature to raise the riser temperature reverses the effect of poly cyclic468 CHAPTER 11
aromatics. In so doing, however, thermal cracking occurs which is undesirable. To
solve this problem it is necessary to be able to control riser temperature independentlyof mix temperature.
Mix temperature control (MTC) is achieved by injecting a suitable heavy cycle oil
stream into the riser above the oil feed injection point. This essentially separates theriser into two reaction zones. The ﬁrst is between the feed injection and the cycle oilinlet. This zone is characterized by a high mix temperature, a high catalyst to oil ratio,and a very short contact time.
The second zone above the cycle oil inlet operates under more conventional catalytic
cracking conditions. The riser temperature is maintained independently by the in-troduction of the regenerated catalyst. Thus increase in cycle oil leads to decreasein riser temperature which introduces more catalyst, this ﬁnally increases the mixtemperature, and the catalyst to oil ratio and decreases the regenerator temperature.
The lift gas technology
As described earlier it is highly desirable to achieve good catalyst/oil mixing as
early and as quickly as possible. The method described to achieve this requires thepreacceleration and dilution of the catalyst stream. Traditionally steam is the mediumused to maintain catalyst bed ﬂuidity and movement in the riser. Steam, however, hasdeleterious effect on the very hot catalyst that is met in residue cracking processes.Steam under these conditions causes hydro-thermal deactivation of the catalyst.
Much work has been done in reducing the use of steam in contact with the hot catalyst.
Some of the results of the work showed that if the partial pressure of steam is keptlow, the hydro-thermal effects are greatly reduced, in the case of relatively metalfree catalyst. A more important result of the work showed that light hydrocarbonsimparted favorable conditioning effects to the freshly regenerated catalyst. This waseven pronounced in catalysts that were heavily contaminated with metals.
Light hydrocarbon gases have been introduced in several heavy oil crackers since
1985. They have operated either with lift gas alone or mixed with steam. The lim-itations to the use of lift gas rests in the ability of downstream units to handle theadditional gas. Table 11.6 compares the effect of lift gas in residual operation withthe use of steam.
As can be seen the use of lift gas as an alternative to steam gives:
rLower hydrogen production
rLower hydrogen/methane ratio
rIncrease in liquid yieldUPGRADING RESIDUES 469

Residuum hydrocracking
Residuum hydrocracking is often combined with a thermal cracker to upgrade the
‘bottom of the barrel’and provide high quality light and middle distillates. Figure
11.15 shows such a conﬁguration.
Bitumen feed from the crude vacuum distillation unit enters the hydrocracker section
of the plant to be preheated by hot ﬂash vapors in shell and tube exchangers andﬁnally in a ﬁred heater. A recycle and make up hydrogen stream is similarly heated byexchange with hot ﬂash vapors. The hydrogen stream is mixed with the hot bitumenstream before entering the hydrocracker heater. The feed streams are risen to thereactor temperature in the heater and leave to enter the top of the reactor vessel.The feed streams ﬂow downwards through the catalyst beds contained in the reactor.Additional cold hydrogen is injected at various sections of the reactor to providetemperature control as the hydrocracking process is exothermal.
The reactor efﬂuent leaves the reactor to enter a hot ﬂash drum. Here the heavy"
"bituminous portion of the efﬂuent leaves from the bottom of the drum while thelighter oil and gas phase leaves as a vapor from the top of the drum. This vapor issubsequently cooled by heat exchange with the feed and further cooled and partiallycondensed by an air cooler. This cooled stream then enters a cold separator operatingat a pressure only slightly lower than that of the reactor. A rich hydrogen gas streamis removed from this drum to be amine treated and returned as recycle gas to theprocess. The distillate liquid leaves from the bottom of the separator to join a vaporstream from the hot ﬂash surge drum (thermal cracker feed surge drum). Both theseHOT FLASH

streams enter the cold ﬂash drum which operates at a much lower pressure than the
upstream equipment. A gas stream is removed from the drum to be routed to anabsorber unit. The liquid distillate from the drum is routed to the debutanizer in alight ends recovery unit.
The thermal cracking section of the unit takes as feed the heavy bituminous liquid
from the hot ﬂash drum. This enters the cracker heater via a surge drum. This heaterhas two parallel coils. The oil feed enters these coils to be thermally cracked to formsome lighter products. The stream leaving the heater is quenched before entering aﬂash chamber. This vessel contains some bafﬂed trays and a light gas and oil vaporstream leaves overhead. This stream is subsequently cooled and the distillate formedrouted to the cold ﬂash drum. The bottoms from the ﬂash chamber is fed to the thermalcracker vacuum distillation unit where vacuum gas oil is removed as feed to a FCCUor to a lube oil reﬁning facilities.
Hydrocracking yields, and product properties
The following data illustrate the yield and operating conditions for a ﬁxed bed residue
hydrocracker. Both the start of run (SOR) and end of run data are shown. These wererecorded during a test run on a Middle East vacuum residue feed. This hydrocrackercontained a guard reactor which essentially converted most of the nitrogen and sulfurcontent of the feed to ammonia and hydrogen sulﬁde, respectively (Table 11.7).
The hot ﬂash liquid is subsequently further cracked in a thermal cracker or can be
vacuum distilled to obtain vacuum distillates to be fed to a FCCU or a distillatehydrocracker. A typical TBP curve for this liquid is given below as Figure 11.16.
Effect of heavy metals on the catalyst
Metals such as Vanadium, Nickel, and Sodium seriously reduce the life of the cat-
alyst in most residue ﬁxed bed reactors. This fact makes the process less competi-tive to other residue upgrading ones. The addition of a front-end guard reactor doeshelp to prolong the catalyst life by removing some of these metal contaminants.The catalyst in this guard reactor does become poisoned also, but this catalyst usu-ally Cobalt Molybdenum, is considerably less expensive than that used for hydro-cracking.
The most effective solution to date however is to extract the very heavy ends of
the residue. This is the asphalt portion and almost all the metals are contained inthese asphaltene molecules. The extraction of these asphaltenes is accomplishedby the counter current ﬂow of propane as a liquid. The heavy asphalt is then routedto reﬁnery fuel or blended into the asphalt pool for marketing.472 CHAPTER 11

Conclusion
Catalytic cracking of residues described above is a poor competitor to the other direct"
"processes for residue upgrading. The process itself is costly to build and has relativelyhigh operating and maintenance costs. The products however are good quality, andrequire very little downstream treatment. The naphtha produced is (as in the caseof distillate hydrocracking) high in naphthene content ideal for gasoline productionor as feed to an aromatic production process. The middle distillates also are of highquality with the kerosene fraction having very low smoke point and the gas oil fractionhaving a good cetane number. In the process illustration given as Figure 11.15 thelight distillate liquid from the cold ﬂash drum and the associated vapor are routedto a distillate hydrocracker recovery side for further processing and fractionation.UPGRADING RESIDUES 473

Appendix 11.1: Sizing a thermal cracker heater/reactor
In this example it is required to deﬁne a thermal cracker in terms of coil volume
and temperature proﬁle in processing an atmospheric residue from Sasson Crude.The 25,500 BPSD of the +600
◦F residue is preheated to 500◦F by heat exchange
with the cracker’ s products and reﬂux stream before entering the convection side ofthe cracker’ s heater/ reactor. It is required to produce a conversion (based on gas tonaphtha of 260
◦F cut point) of 9 wt% and the heater will be ﬁtted with 4/prime/primeschedule
80 tubes throughout. It will be designed to have three sections which are:
rThe convection section with a heat ﬂux of 12,000 Btu/hr sqft.
rThe radiant heater section with a heat ﬂux of 15,000 Btu/hr sqft.
rThe soaker section with a heat ﬂux of 10,000 Btu/hr sqft.
The heater section and the soaker section are divided by a ﬁre wall. A predictedtemperature proﬁle is given in the diagram below as Figure 11.17.

Cracking begins at a temperature of 800◦F and the oil feed and steam enters the
soaking section at 820◦. The purpose of the soaking section is to provide a space for
the cracking function to occur at a moderate increase in temperature. To calculate the"
"required coil volume the ﬁrst step is to assign the degree of cracking that occurs atthe end of each section. This is a trial and error process and provides an SVF value toeach section which in turn is used to calculate the amount of cracked products leavingeach section. Using these amounts the heat balances for each section of the soakercoil are calculated. Thus:

The non-energy reﬁneries
D.S.J. Jones
Introduction
Non-energy reﬁneries refer to those plants that produce non-energy products from
crude oil. These fall into two categories, which are:
The Lube Oil Reﬁnery
The Petrochemical Reﬁnery
Both of these types of reﬁneries have already been mentioned in Chapter 1 of this
Handbook. This chapter then provides some further details on these two importantreﬁning aspects of crude oil.
The lube oil reﬁnery
The lube oil reﬁnery is usually included as part of a conventional energy reﬁnery. That
being the case this lube oil section of the process will take its feed from the atmosphericdistillation tower in the form of an atmospheric residue stream. Conventional lubereﬁning utilizes solvent extraction processes to separate undesirable materials fromthe natural desirable ones present in the crude oil. However many of the world’ s crudeoils do not have enough of these desirable molecules in them to justify the cost ofelaborate extraction processes, and therefore lube oil reﬁning leans towards processingthe ‘ desirable’lube oil crude oils. An example of desirable lube oils are those fromVenezuela (i.e., Tia Juana, and the heavy Bachequero crude). This restriction onlube oil production often leads to large reﬁneries dedicating a separate atmosphericdistillation unit to provide the necessary lube oil feed.
This problem of lube oil selective crude oils has diminished somewhat with the
development of heavy hydrotreating and hydrocracking for lube oil treating. Theseprocesses virtually eliminate the need for solvent extraction and de-waxing of thelube oil stock. Hydrotreating of light vacuum distillates to make lube oil speciﬁcation
483484 CHAPTER 12
has been in commercial use since the mid-1960s, but with the advancement of this
technology the heavier lube oil stock can also be treated now in a similar manner.Lube base oil production by severe hydrotreating, hydrocracking, and hydro dewaxing,also improves color and stability but each crude source of the lube oil stock requiresdifferent processing conditions in these hydro processes. This in turn leads to differentyields of the various cuts to meet their speciﬁed viscosity.
Deﬁnitions and speciﬁcations
Lube oil reﬁning has developed its own series of deﬁnitions quite separate to those
of the conventional energy reﬁneries. Some of the major deﬁnitions are as follows:
rLube base stockThis refers to a lube product that meets all lube speciﬁcations and is suitable forblending to meet performance speciﬁcations.
rLube slateA lube slate is the set of lube base stocks produced by the reﬁnery. This is usuallya set of 4–6 base stocks.
rNeutral lubesThese are obtained from straight run cuts of the vacuum tower.
rBright stock lubesThese are processed from the rafﬁnate of the vacuum residue de-asphalting unit.
rVirgin base lube oilsAre those base stocks obtained by processing straight run distillates from crude.
rRe-reﬁned base stocksAre those processed from used or recycled lube oils.
rFinished lube oilThis is a lube oil that has been blended to meet a ﬁnal speciﬁcation.
rParafﬁnic lube oilsThese are all grades of lube oils, from both neutral and bright stocks, that have aﬁnished viscosity index (VI) greater than 75.
rNaphthenic lube oilsThese are lubricants with a VI less than 75.
There are two important speciﬁcation deﬁnitions for lube oils. These are:
rThe Quality Speciﬁcation
rThe Performance Speciﬁcation
The quality speciﬁcation
Quality speciﬁcation includes those for kinematic viscosity, viscosity index, pour
point, color, ﬂash point. These speciﬁcations are determined by standard tests fromTHE NON-ENERGY REFINERIES 485

Forexample one very well known motor oil speciﬁcation is SAE viscosity, established bythe Society of Automotive Engineers, an organization that also carries out research,and publishes speciﬁcation on a wide range of automotive topics. Figure 12.1 gives arange of Viscosities versus Temperature for a family of motor crankcase oils.
Although the kinematic viscosity is measured in centistokes, speciﬁcations are labeled
in Saybolt seconds (SSU).
Performance speciﬁcations
Finished lube oil products are usually certiﬁed or qualiﬁed against performance
speciﬁcation requirements established by equipment and vehicle manufacturers,government bodies, and industrial organizations such as SAE. These qualiﬁcationsusually require extensive performance testing using specialized apparatus and engines486 CHAPTER 12
(including road tests). These tests refer only to those base oils produced in a speciﬁc
manner and from speciﬁc crudes. Signiﬁcantly altering the process scheme or thecrude source could violate the intent and validity of the performance qualiﬁcationcertiﬁcate.
The performance of the lube base oils in service cannot be measured until after the
production sequences are long completed. Manufacturing lube base oils thereforerequires good correlations between measured properties at each stage of productionand the ﬁnal product performance quality. Developing these operating guidelines andcorrelations for plant units requires pilot plant and full plant test runs for each crudeoil feedstock and ﬁnished products.
Lube oil properties
The important properties that are recognized in lube oil production are:
rViscosity
rViscosity Index
rPour Point
rOxidation Stability
rFlash Point
rThermal Stability
rV olatility
rColor.
These are discussed in the following paragraphs.Viscosity. This is the single most important characteristic of any lube oil. At its service
temperature it is the balance to prevent wear and to enhance fuel economy. Most
bearings operate with a hydrodynamic wedge shaped ﬁlm of lubricant between thebearing surfaces. This mechanism minimizes wear of the surfaces under the operatingconditions of the machinery. To accomplish this the lube oil must have adequateviscosity for the operating load, bearing speed, and the bearing surface smoothnessto allow the hydrodynamic head to form and remain between the surfaces. Too higha viscosity will cause extra friction and heat, while too low a viscosity will allow thesurfaces to touch. A bearing may operate over a wide temperature range, as in anengine or automatic transmission, and the lube oil has to have adequate viscosity overthe entire temperature range to be effective.
Viscosity index. This is a measure of the amount the viscosity of a lube oil will
change with temperature. A high viscosity index denotes less change of viscosity
with temperature. High viscosity index is necessary for lube oils that are to be usedfor services with large temperature operating range.THE NON-ENERGY REFINERIES 487
Pour point. This property is important for any application in cold climates. Too high a
pour point will result in the oil being gelatinous or even solid at ambient temperatures.
Oxidation stability. This is also an important requirement for a lube oil that is to
operate under severe high-temperature conditions. If the oil has a tendency to oxidize
the product of oxidation is often hard granules (similar to coke) which will damagebearing surfaces and block up the lube oil system ﬁlters and ports.
Flash point. The ﬂash point of a lube oil must be high enough to be safe under any
of the temperature condition that the lube oil will be required to operate.Thermal stability. This property requirement is similar to that for oxidation stability.
In the case of thermal stability the lube oil must be able to operate within its speciﬁed
temperature range without the danger of the oil cracking or breaking down and givingrise to harmful polymers, acids, or other compounds.
V olatility. This property is important for ensuring minimizing any vaporization of the
oil and thus maintaining the lowest oil consumption.Color. Unusually dark coloring in a lube oil is indicative of the presence of oleﬁns.
These are undesirable in lube oils as they are thermally unstable. Lube oils are often
ﬁltered through a clay bed (usually bauxite) to improve color. Hydroprocessing alwaysresults in lube stocks with good color.
A description of major processes in lube oil reﬁning
It is not proposed to describe or discuss the hydro units now used extensively in modern
lube oil reﬁning. These units have a similar process conﬁguration as those describedelsewhere in this book, only the conditions applicable to their speciﬁc application willbe different. The major processes described here are:
rThe propane deasphalting process
rAn aromatic extraction— Furfural
rA de-waxing process— MEK
The deasphalting process"
"Deasphalting the heavy end of crude, that is the vacuum residue, is not entirely reserved
for the production of lube oils. In energy reﬁneries it is used to remove the asphalteneportion of the residue to prepare a suitable feedstock for catalytic conversion units. Inmost of these conversion units the performance of the catalyst is greatly impaired bythe presence of heavy metals and the high Conradson carbon content of the residue488 CHAPTER 12
feed. Most of the metals are entrained in the asphaltene compounds which makes
up most of the asphalt portion of the residue. These asphaltenes are also high inConradson carbon content, so the removal of these serves to eliminate both the heavymetal content and the high Conradson carbon.
In the case of lube oil production the light liquid phase resulting from the extraction of
the asphalt makes excellent lube base oil. This deasphalted oil is termed ‘ Bright Stock’and can now be further reﬁned in the same way as neutral base stock which are vacuumdistillates to meet the speciﬁcations for blend stocks. The process conﬁguration isshown as Figure 12.2.
The conﬁguration shown here is that for a propane deasphalting unit. Vacuum residue
feed enters the unit directly from the vacuum distillation tower and is heated to an inlettemperature of around 140
◦F before entering the top section of a trayed extraction
tower at a pressure of 485 psig. Liquid propane is introduced into the bottom of thetower below the bottom tray.
The propane solvent moves up the tower counter current to the precipitated asphalt.
The extracted asphalt is removed from the bottom of the tower and is routed througha ﬁred heater to enter the top tray of a bafﬂe-trayed separator. Some of the propaneentrained in the asphalt phase is removed from the overhead of the ﬂash tower. Theasphalt phase leaves the bottom of the ﬂash tower, and is reduced in pressure before en-tering the asphalt stripper tower above the top row of bafﬂes. Steam is introduced to thebottom of the tower, and the remaining entrained propane is stripped out of the asphalt.The stripped asphalt leaves the bottom of the tower, is cooled to battery conditions androuted to storage or the asphalt blending plant. The propane stripout enters the suctionside of a propane compressor and on discharge routed to the propane accumulator.
The deasphalted oil phase from the extraction tower overhead enters a high-pressure
oil vaporizer which removes most of the entrained propane. The propane stream leavesthe vaporizer to be cooled and enter the propane accumulator. On leaving the vaporizer,the oil phase enters the top row of bafﬂes in a low-pressure stripper tower. Steam isintroduced to the bottom trays of the tower and moves up the tower counter currentto the oil phase. The residual propane is stripped out of the oil phase and leaves thetop of the stripper tower with the steam. This overhead vapor stream joins the streamfrom the low-pressure asphalt stripper at the suction of the propane compressor.
The compressed propane is cooled and drained free of the water from the stripping
steam in the accumulator. The dry propane is then recycled to enter the extractiontower.

The lube oil extraction process—furfural extraction
The furfural extraction process described here is designed to produce lube oil base oils
(before dewaxing) having high viscosity indices and other desirable lube oil qualities,such as color and stability. The furfural process is one of a few means of removingaromatic and naphthenic compounds from both neutral feed stocks and the bright oilfeed stocks (de asphalted oils) by extracting them using furfural as solvent. The othermost common processes to attain this is extraction using liquid SO
2as solvent and a
process using phenol as solvent. The furfural process conﬁguration is shown belowas Figure 12.3.

removed from the lube oil feed to leave the bottom of the tower as a rich furfural
stream. This stream is heated in a ﬁred heater before entering an extract stripper. Thefurfural is stripped off and leaves the top of the stripper to be cooled and enter thefurfural accumulator vessel. Stripping of the furfural is achieved using an inert gasstripping stream introduced below the bottom row of trays in the stripper. Inert gas isused as the stripping medium because furfural is highly susceptible to polymerizingon exposure to steam or air. The extract leaves the bottom of the tower to be cooledand routed to reﬁnery fuel or the fuel oil pool.
The rafﬁnate oil essentially free of aromatic and naphthene compounds leaves the
top of the extraction tower to be heated in a ﬁred heater before entering the rafﬁnatestripper. The entrained furfural is again stripped out using an inert gas as the strippingmedium leaving the rafﬁnate to be routed from the bottom of the stripper to a de-waxing plant. The stripped furfural stream leaves the top of the stripper to be cooledand collected in the furfural accumulator.
The entrained inert gas from the stripping is ﬂashed off the furfural collected in the
accumulator to be either vented to the atmosphere or returned to the reﬁnery’ s inertgas system.
Some data on this process is given in Table 12.2. These data are based on two typical
feedstocks A and B which cover the usual range of feedstock parameters.
The Extraction Tower operates at between 150 and 200 psig and at a temperature
Top/Bottom of between 190/140
◦F and 195/135◦F.
The dewaxing process—MEK dewaxing
There are several dewaxing processes in use today. Among them are the propane de-
waxer, Edeleanu’ sS O 2/benzol combination of extraction and dewaxing, the MIBK
(methyl iso butyl ketone), and the more common MEK (metyl ethyl ketone) process.These processes, except the Edeleanu process, have a similar process conﬁguration.The one based on MEK is shown in Figure 12.4.MEK Accumulator

Figure 12.4. Conﬁguration of a MEK dewaxing process.494 CHAPTER 12
Either neutral base oil or bright stock from the extraction unit is mixed with MEK
before entering a tubular chilling unit. During the chilling of the mixture the waxcontent in the oil forms crystals in the presence of the MEK. The chiller tubes arefurnished with internal chain scrapers which collect the oily slurry. This stream is thenintroduced to the bottom trough of a rotary ﬁlter. The outer drum of the ﬁlter is coveredby a ﬁlter cloth. The drum in turn is divided into two or sometimes three chambers.The ﬁrst is under vacuum and draws the oily slurry in the trough through the ﬁltercloth. The oil phase free of wax crystals ﬂows though the cloth to the inner section ofthe drum. The wax is retained ﬁrmly on the cloth. In some processes a stream of thedewaxed oil is returned as a wash to the wax cake. As the drum rotates it enters thesecond phase of its operation. Here a positive pressure in the form of an inert gas streamis applied to the rear of the wax cake. This lifts the cake off the ﬁlter cloth sufﬁcient fora disengaging scraper to remove the cake and deliver it to a heated trough where thewax is melted. The molten wax is pumped from the trough to the top row of bafﬂes ina wax stripper tower. Here the wax is stripped free of MEK using a stream of inert gaspassing upwards through several rows of bafﬂe trays counter current to the wax stream.The stripped wax is pumped from the bottom of the stripper to storage and furthertreating.
The dewaxed oil phase from the ﬁlter is pumped from the inner chamber of the ﬁlter
to a steam heater and then to the top row of disc and donut trays in the oil strippertower. Inert gas ﬂows upwards through several rows of trays counter current to theoil ﬂowing downward. The oil is stripped free of MEK and leaves the bottom of thetower to storage and use as blend stock.
The MEK from both strippers are collected, cooled, and routed to an accumulator
drum. Here the absorbed inert gas and the blow gas are ﬂashed off to be recycled orvented. The MEK is returned to the system by a pump to join the waxy oil feed at thechillers (Table 12.3).
12.2 Asphalt production"
"Almost invariably associated with the Lube Oil Reﬁnery are facilities for the produc-
tion of Asphalt. It is a popular belief, even among engineers that asphalt can be madefrom the heavy end of any crude oil. Unfortunately this belief is far from being correct.The asphalt product must have a series of properties which meet the speciﬁcations forthe different grades. Since many of these properties are interrelated, it is difﬁcult tomeet all the speciﬁcations at the same time. The penetration/softening point relation-ship is probably the most important property to be considered from this stand point.
The ideal crude for asphalt production should be heavy, have a high, good quality
asphalt yield, and, of course, should be inexpensive. The oxidizing properties of theTHE NON-ENERGY REFINERIES 495

asphalt must also be considered. Some crudes will produce ﬁne paving stock, but will
not be good feed for air blowing, when the speciﬁcation of the product calls for an‘ oxidized’asphalt.
Types of asphalt products
There are two major categories of asphalt products. These are:
rPaving and liquid asphalt
rRooﬁng asphalt
The paving and liquid asphalt
The paving and liquid asphalt products are again sub divided into ﬁve paving grades ofpaving and three liquid grades. The paving grades will have a penetration speciﬁcationof 300 or less @ 77
◦F and 100 g weight, while the softer liquid grades will have a
penetration of 300 and higher. The ﬁve paving grades fall into the following categoriesbased on their penetration:
40–50, 60–70, 85–100, 120–150, 200–300.
The liquid asphalt grades are typiﬁed as, RC (Rapid Curing), MC (Medium Curing),and SC (Slow Curing) each of these grades will also have 4 viscosity grades as givenbelow:
70 grade— RC/MC/SC 70 to 140 cS @ 140
◦F.
250 grade— RC/MC/SC 250 to 500 cS.800 grade— RC/MC/SC 800 to 1,600 cS.
3,000 grade— RC/MC/SC 3,000 to 6,000 cS.496 CHAPTER 12
Rapid curing cutbacks are penetration asphalt and naphtha blends having a viscosity
range from 75 SSF @ 77◦F to 600 SSF @ 180◦F . The naphtha content may be as
high as 75% vol. Cutbacks are hot sprayed onto existing roads as a binding medium
for new wearing surfaces.
Medium curing cutbacks are penetration grade asphalt and kerosene blends with four
grades having the same viscosities as the RC cutbacks. These are used in road building
in the same way as the RC cutbacks.
Slow curing cutbacks are penetration asphalt and gas oil blends normally produced
directly from the crude oil atmospheric or vacuum distillation. The volume produced
is small and they are used mainly as a gravel dust layer or mixed with aggregates forcold patching of asphalt surfaces.
Rooﬁng asphalt
The second largest asphalt use is that for rooﬁng. Most of these asphalts are pro-duced by air blowing. There are three major rooﬁng grades and may be classiﬁed bypenetration and softening points. These are:
P e n@7 7◦F Softening point◦F
Type 1 25–50 140–150
Type 2 20–30 166–175Type 3 15–25 190–205
Type 1 grade is used on ‘ Dead Flat’roof while the other two are used on intermediate
and steep slope roofs respectively.
Asphalt oxidizing mechanism
Asphalt is basically a colloidal dispersion of asphaltenes in oil with resins as the
stabilizing agent. The quantities of these can vary widely with the type of crude.
Asphaltenes can be hydrogenated to resins, resins to oils. Resins can be oxidized to
asphaltenes, oil to resins. Thus:
Asphaltenes + H2 H2→ Oil
+
+Resins
Asphaltenes + O2  O2+Oil
Oxidation is really a misnomer, as air blown asphalt has essentially the same oxygencontent as the charge. Air blowing asphalt increases the asphaltene content, hardens it,THE NON-ENERGY REFINERIES 497
decreases penetration, increases softening, and reduces ductility. Basically air blowing
is a polymerization process following the route below:
1. Addition of O 2to form unstable compounds from which H 2O is eliminated leaving
unsaturated compounds which polymerize.
2. Addition of O 2to form carboxyl derivatives from which CO 2is eliminated followed
again by polymerization.
3. Formation and elimination of volatile oxidation products other than H 2O and CO 2
followed again by polymerization.
It is worth noting, that the best crudes for asphalt air blowing are those with high
percentage of asphaltene fraction and low in parafﬁn hydrocarbons, and waxes. Resinscan be oxidized to asphaltenes relatively easily, so crudes rich in resin are good rawmaterials for asphalt manufacture. Oils can also be oxidized to asphaltenes, but theymust be oxidized to resins ﬁrst, which requires a more severe operation. Crackedresidua simply do not make good asphalt.
Asphalt yields"
"In general heavier crudes contain a higher content of asphalt or asphaltic material and
this is demonstrated in Figure 12.5.
The actual yield of these materials depends mainly on the composition of the crude
itself in terms of parafﬁnic, oleﬁnic, asphaltenic, and naphthenic fractions it contains.Good reliable crude oil assays provide such data for speciﬁc crude oils. Howeverif such data is absent then a reasonably close estimate of the asphalt yield can beobtained using a method by S. Patel (Oil & Gas Journal Feb 1964).
This predicting method correlates Asphalt yield vs. ‘ Asphalt Factor’a parameterobtained by Patel’ s formula, which is:

The calculation is by trial and error, and this is given in the example for the design of
an asphalt air blowing process in Appendix 12.1 of this chapter.
Asphalt blowing process
Blowing air into a vessel containing asphalt from vacuum distillation or the de-
asphalting process will change its penetration and softening properties. Among thevariables that affect the manufacture of air blown asphalt are:THE NON-ENERGY REFINERIES 499
Figure 12.6. How to obtain crude oil slopes for use in the Patel equation.
rThe rate of the air injected
rThe temperature of the asphalt
rRetention time of the asphalt
rThe system pressure
These variables and their effect on the process are discussed below.
The rate of air injected
This is the most important variable in the process. If the temperature, pressure, andresidence time are kept constant in the oxidizer, the softening point of the asphalt(the ring & ball) can be remarkably increased by increasing the air rate. This increaseis larger at low air rates than higher values A point is reached where the increase inair rate has little effect on the softening point and this is shown in Figure 12.8. Thepenetration properties of the asphalt are also affected by the air rate and this is shownin Figure 12.9.
For continuous operation normal air rates will be between 0.3 SCFM/BPSD of oil to
1.0 SCFM/BPSD. For Batch processes this rate will be between 1.5 SCFM/Bbl to 9.5SCFM/Bbl this will depend of course on the length of each batch and the number ofcycles to be processed each day. The air supply must not contain free water but need500 CHAPTER 12Yield of 100 Pen Asphalt % Vol of Whole Crude.

knock out pot is sufﬁcient to remove the free water.
The reaction temperature
If the other variables are kept constant increase in the temperature of the oxidizerincreases the softening point of the asphalt. The effect of temperature increase on thesoftening point is larger at the lower temperature levels than when the temperature isalready high. A point is reached when the increase in temperature has little effect on thesoftening point. Figure 12.10 shows this effect. The ratio of softening point and pene-tration increases by decreasing the temperature. To increase the softening point with-out affecting the penetration it is necessary to reduce the reaction temperature, blowair for a longer period, or increase the residence time of the asphalt. Figure 12.11shows this behavior.THE NON-ENERGY REFINERIES 501
Figure 12.8. Effect of air rates on softening point.
Figure 12.9. Effect of air rates on softening point/penetration ratio.502 CHAPTER 12
Figure 12.10. Effect of temperature on softening point (or hardness).
There are certain limitations to the temperatures at which the oxidizer can be designed
or operated. The design of the oxidizer should not be higher than 50◦F below the ﬂash
point of the feedstock or any of its components. It must however be recognized thateffective oxidizing reaction does not occur at temperatures below 420
◦F . Generally
speaking batch processes operate at a temperature between 430◦F and 475◦F while
continuous processes operate at between 500◦F and 550◦F . The asphalt oxidizing"
"reaction is exothermic and as such must be controlled by some form of cooling. Themost common means of cooling in continuous processes is to recycle a portion ofthe reacting feed through a cooler and returning it to the reactor mixed with the feed.Another method is to install cooling coils into the reactor itself. This method is usedmostly for batch processes. Steam is injected above the oil level in the reactor. Themain purpose of this steam is to act as snufﬁng steam to avoid explosion in the air/oilatmosphere existing in this zone.
Retention and contact time
If all other variables are kept constant, the softening point can be remarkably increasedby increasing the retention time of the asphalt in contact with air in the oxidizer. Inthe case of continuous processes this is achieved by varying the throughput or byTHE NON-ENERGY REFINERIES 503
Figure 12.11. Effect of temperature on softening point/penetration ratio.
increasing the volume of asphalt (depth) in the oxidizer. In the case of the batch
process this is achieved by varying the batch residence time. Figures 12.12–12.15show the effect of the changing retention time.
The retention time or residence time required for oxidation is different in every case
depending on how much change in softening point or penetration is required. A goodrule of thumb is to calculate retention time assuming it takes one hour to increase12
◦F in the softening point of the asphalt. For example to increase the softening point
of 100◦F asphalt to a 220◦F product will require a residence time of220−100
12=10 hr.
A second rough rule for batch processes is that it takes approximately 4–8 hr ofblowing utilizing 15 SCFM of air per ton of asphalt. That is if 25 SCFM of air is usedthe residence time would be around 2.4–4.8 hr since the effect of residence time isproportional to the oxidation rate. A continuous process usually requires less time,about one half that of a batch process.
Increasing the contact time or the depth of the asphalt level in the oxidizer ves-
sel will increase the softening point of the asphalt if all other variables remain504 CHAPTER 12

constant. In this case the softening point is changed without altering the softening
point/penetration ratio. The effect of this variable is the same as increasing the resi-dence time of the asphalt. Figure 12.16 shows this effect.
Although the height of the liquid and the residence time of the air are closely related
they don’ t exactly have the same effect on the oxidizing process. The higher the liquidlevel the more efﬁcient is the oxidizing process. This is so because the same amount ofair is better utilized by remaining in contact with the oil for a longer period. Since theair is not completely used by the time it leaves the oxidizer, asphalt can be oxidizedfaster with the same air rate in a tall small diameter oxidizer than one of a largerdiameter but shorter, even though the residence time will be the same in both cases.
Normally a height to diameter ratios of between 3.5/1 and 5/1 are used in the design
of continuous process oxidizers and a somewhat lower 2.5/1 for batch processes. Theliquid level in the oxidizer is usually no more than 2/3 of the total height of the vessel.Figure 12.17. A process ﬂow diagram of a typical bitumen manufacturing plant.
508 CHAPTER 12
At least 10 ft must remain free of liquid above the high liquid level. This is to allow
for liquid disengaging and foaming.
The system pressure
With all other variables constant, increasing the pressure of the oxidizer will increasethe asphalt softening point. The effect of increasing pressure however is not as greatas the effect of increasing any of the other variables. Perhaps the more signiﬁcantchange in increasing the oxidizer pressure is in the ratio of softening point to pene-tration of the asphalt. Usually it is not economical to operate at high pressure sincethe gains on hardening rates are small relative to the effect of the other variables.For practical purposes, pressure is not considered a design variable, and most oxidiz-ers operate at near atmospheric pressure. A positive pressure of 5 psig is the moreusual.
A ﬂowsheet of a typical asphalt blowing plant is given as Figure 12.17.
The petrochemical reﬁnery
The petrochemical reﬁnery processes crude oil to produce feedstock for chemical
plants. The two most important processes are:
rThe production of aromatics
rThe production of oleﬁns"
"Both of these types of petrochemical reﬁneries have been described brieﬂy in Chapter1 of this Handbook. It is not proposed to describe these type of reﬁneries further here.This chapter will deal with a typical example of the process conﬁguration for theproduction of aromatics only. This is probably the more common integration of thepetrochemical reﬁnery because a normal energy reﬁnery is more easily adapted toaromatics with the minimum of additional processes.
The production of aromatics
The aromatics referred to here are:
rBenzene
rToluene
rEthyl benzene
rPara-xylene
rMeta-xylene
rOrtho-xyleneTHE NON-ENERGY REFINERIES 509
The conﬁguration described here begins with a mixed aromatic stream which has been
obtained by catalytic reforming of a high naphthene content naphtha. This naphthawould probably have been a product of a hydrocracker producing energy productsfrom heavy waxy distillate. There are reﬁneries that do hydrocrack heavy distillatesto extinction to produce this kind of high naphthene naphtha only. The more commonthough is the energy hydrocracker producing a range of products of which the naphthais just one of them. The reformate from this high naphthene feed is very rich in thearomatics listed above. To increase the aromatic content as feed to the aromaticcomplex the aromatics are separated from the remaining parafﬁn’ s by an extractionprocess.
The aromatics recovery complex which takes as feed the mixed aromatic stream is
shown in Figure 12.18.
In this particular scheme the objective is to produce and maximize the benzene product
and the ortho-xylene products only. Many aromatic complexes also produce para-xylene as product via a crystallization or adsorption step. A description of these unitsand the process ﬂow of the complex follows.
Feed fractionation
The fresh mixed aromatics is delivered from off plot to enter a 35 tray splitter tower.
Benzene and toluene are removed as overhead product while the mixed xylene streamsleave as the bottom product.
Xylene splitter and isomerization process
The mixed xylene stream leaves the splitter and is routed to a xylene splitter. This
is a super fractionating tower containing at least 135 fractionating trays. The frac-tionation split is between the meta- and ortho-xylene components. A recycle streamfrom an isomerization plant rich in ortho-xylene is also fed to this xylene splitter.The overhead rich in ethyl benzene and the para, meta-xylenes, is routed from thesplitter to an isomerization plant. These C
8aromatics are isomerized over a catalyst
and in the presence of a rich hydrogen stream to a product rich in ortho-xylene butcontaining also benzene, toluene, and some ethyl benzene with some light hydrocar-bons and hydrogen in equilibrium. This isomerate enters a fractionator in which thelight hydrocarbons and some ethylbenzene are removed as overheads while the bottomproduct, containing mostly ortho-xylene, with the other C
8’ s in equilibrium is returned
to the xylene splitter. The light isomerate overhead product from the fractionator isstabilized in a separate stabilizing column before being routed to the benzene recov-ery section. The bottom product from the xylene splitter enters an ortho-xylene reruntower from which commercially pure ortho-xylene leaves as the overhead product. TheBenzene–Toluene Splitter.

bottom product leaving this tower contains heavy aromatics (heavier than C 8’ s) and is
routed to fuel, or, in some cases, to trans alleylation with toluene to yield more C 8s.
Dealkylation and benzene recovery
The overheads from the feed fractionator and the bottom product from the light
isomerate stabilizer combine to form the fresh feed to a benzene fractionator. This feedstream will contain mostly benzene and toluene. A recycle stream from the toluenedealkylation plant, if present, containing a high proportion of benzene joins the freshfeed to enter the benzene fractionator. Benzene is removed from this fractionator asan overhead product, while toluene is removed as a re-boiled stripped side streamproduct. A small bottom make of polymer and tar is removed as a bottom product.The toluene stream may be routed to a dealkylation unit in which about 98 mol%of the toluene is converted to benzene. This dealkylated product forms the recyclestream to join the fresh feed to the benzene fractionator.

following mixed aromatic feed to the units:

The products required to be maximized are:

Ortho-xylene will contain not less than 99.0 wt% of ortho-xylene
Process discussion
Feed fractionation and xylene splitterGood separation of the light aromatics and the xylenes can be achieved in a 35 trayed
column operating at about 35 psig in the reﬂux drum. At this pressure the tower512 CHAPTER 12
overheads are at a temperature high enough to offer some preheating of the tower
feed by the overhead condensers. Splitting the xylenes however requires a tower ofabout 136–140 trays. A reasonable economic overhead pressure (in the reﬂux drum)is about 98 psig. Again at this pressure, as in the case of the feed fractionator, theoverhead temperatures offers some feed preheat from the overhead condensers andto reboil the ortho-xylene rerun tower.
The isomerization unit
This is a licensed process which converts the xylene streams to approach an equilib-
rium xylene composition. Some isomerization units convert ethylbenzene to xyleneswhile others essentially dealkylate the ethylbenzene. By removing one or more ofthe components (ortho-xylene in this case) the remaining xylenes in the feed are iso-merized to recover the equilibrium distribution lost by the removal. The unselectedisomers in the fresh feed are recycled to extinction by this method. The process shownhere utilizes around 1.2 mmScf/D of 81.5 mol % hydrogen.
The dealkylation unit
This unit is also a licensed process. its purpose is to de-alkylate the toluene component
in the feed to produce benzene.
This process utilizes a separate polymer reactor to increase benzene selectivity. It also
uses a hydrogenation reactor to control impurities in the benzene such as unsaturatesand sulfur products. The yield of benzene in this process is about 98.2 mole% ontoluene in the feed. Except for very small units a cryogenic step is applied to removethe reaction products of methane and heavier. Where hydrogen from a catalytic re-former is used as make up the C
3’ s, and heavier parafﬁns and any H 2S contained in
it must be removed. An absorber operating at about 250 psig is used to remove thehydrocarbons and a caustic wash used to remove the H
2S. The removal of the C 3’ s
and heavier is advisable as these hydrocrack under the dealkylation reactor condi-tions causing additional reactor temperature rise and increase in hydrogen consump-tion.

and is accepted as the yield of 100 pen asphalt from this crude.
Step 2.0 Calculate throughput of 100 pen and air to oxidizer
From Figure 12.23 the ratio of 100 pen asphalt to a 25 pen asphalt is read off at 0.89
for a characterization factor of 11.2. Then:
For 816 BPSD of 25 pen crude we require a throughput of 816/0.89 =917 BPSD of
100 pen asphalt.For a continuous process, the recommended air rate is 0.3 to 1.0 scfm per BPSD. A
rate of 0.55 will be used here.
Then air rate will be 0.55 ×917=504.4 scfm.

Support systems common to most reﬁneries
D.S.J. Jones
This Chapter covers those systems which support the reﬁning process, and is divided
into the following parts:
rControl Systems
rOffsite Systems
rUtility Systems
rSafety Systems
These parts describe the systems and provides guidelines for the analysis and designof the more important sections of them. Finally the chapter will include descriptionand discussion on the environmental aspect of these systems, with some reference totheir environmental engineering.
13.1 Control systems
The proper operation and performance of any process depends as much on a properly
designed control system as the correct design and speciﬁcation of the equipmentcontained in the process. Indeed this statement can be extended to include the safeoperation of the plant as being dependant to a large extent on the design of the controlsystem."
"Control systems in a process are aimed at maintaining the correct conditions of ﬂow,
temperature, pressure and levels in process equipment and piping. There are thereforefour major types of controls which are:
rFlow control
rTemperature control
rPressure control
rLevel control
521522 CHAPTER 13
The principal objective of all these types of controls is to maintain a steady stable plant
operation and to enable changes and emergencies to be handled safely. The systemmust also be designed to ensure that any process changes can be accommodated withminimum risk of damage to plant equipment.
Before looking at these in some detail it is necessary to deﬁne some of the more
common terms found in control systems.
Deﬁnitions
Surge volumes. This is the volume of liquid between the normal liquid level (NLL)
to the bottom (Tan Line) of a vessel.
Level control range. This is the distance between the high liquid level (HLL) and the
low liquid level (LLL) in the vessel. When using a level controller the signal to the
control valve at HLL will be to fully open the valve. At LLL the signal will be to fullyclose the valve.
Proportional band. This determines the response time of the controller. Normally a
proportional band is adjustable between 5% and 150%. The wider the proportional
band the less sensitive is the control. If a slower response time is required a widerproportional band is used.
Control valve response. The minimum time that should be allowed between HLL and
LLL to permit the control valve to respond effectively to changes in level are:

The above times allows for air signal lags and for operating at a proportional band of
about 50%.
Surge volume. Surge volume is the volume retained in a vessel during operation at a
set level. It is used for:SUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 523
rProtecting equipment from damage caused by ﬂow failures
rProtecting downstream processes from ﬂuctuating ﬂows which could cause poor
process performance
rProtecting downstream processing from ﬂuctuations in feed composition or tem-perature
rProtecting equipment from damage due to coolant failure
Types of surge volumes
There are basically two types of Surge V olumes. These are:
1.Upstream protection surge. This is a surge volume provided to protect the upstream
equipment and its associated pump from feed failure.
2.Downstream ﬂow surge. This is surge volume provided to protect downstream
equipment from feed failures or ﬂuctuations.
Examples of surge types
Process feed. Feed to process units is almost invariably on ﬂow control. Many units
also have a feed surge drum, particularly those units that are sensitive to ﬂow ﬂuctua-
tions or where complete ﬂow failure can cause equipment damage. This is an exampleof “ downstream ﬂow surge” . The surge volume of the drum will depend on
rSource and reliability of source
rType of control at source
rVariations and ﬂuctuations in source rate
Column feed from an upstream column. This feed stream will usually be controlled by
the level in the source column, hence it will be ﬂuctuating. If surge volume is providedonly in the source column it must be sufﬁcient to cater for “ upstream protection” and“ downstream protection” . The use of a surge vessel would be recommended for thiscase.
Feed to ﬁred heaters or boilers. The failure of ﬂow through the tubes of ﬁred heaters
or steam boilers can cause serious damage through overheating of the tubes. Conse-
quently “ downstream protection” is required in this case. Invariably ﬂows to heatersare on ﬂow control.
Reﬂux drums
1.0 When the drum only furnishes reﬂux or reﬂux and product to storage all that is
needed in terms of surge volume is sufﬁcient to provide “ upstream protection” .
That is the surge volume required is only to protect the reﬂux pump from losing524 CHAPTER 13
suction in the case of column feed failure. The pump will be required to circulate
reﬂux and cool the column down during an orderly shut down period.
2.0 When the reﬂux drum furnishes reﬂux and the feed stream to another unit then
the drum must furnish “ upstream protection” surge and “ downstream protection”surge.
3.0 If there is a vapor product from the drum additional volume must be provided
in the drum to allow vapor/liquid disengaging. This will be such as to retain thesame liquid surge capacity as described above.
4.0 Should the vapor phase from the reﬂux drum be routed to the suction of a com-
pressor an even larger volume reﬂux drum will be required. This is to ensurecomplete disengaging of the vapor/liquid. Internal bafﬂes or screens are alsoused in the drums vapor outlet section to ensure complete phase separation.
Quantity of surge volume
The amount of surge volume will vary with the various types given above and with"
"the speciﬁc case in question. Sometimes this amount is set by company speciﬁcationsor, in the case of engineering contractors, by the client. Generally however the processengineer will be responsible for setting a safe and economic surge volume. In doingthis the engineer needs to analyze each case in terms of why the surge volume is beingprovided then deciding how much based on this answer. Figure 13.1 provides someguidelines to the amount of surge that should be applied.
Some useful equations used in setting and handling surge volumes.For surge volume vol cuft =(GPM) (minutes)/7.48

Level control
Surge volumes are maintained by controlling the amount of liquid entering or leavingthe vessel in question. There are several means of accomplishing this and these aredescribed and discussed in the following paragraphs:
(A)Control the surge liquid outlet on level control. This will give a close level control
but a ﬂuctuating outlet ﬂow. The level control valve (LCV) will close completely at
LLL. Thus ﬂow through the outlet line will be completely shut off at LLL.
(B)Control the surge liquid outlet on ﬂow control and provide a low level alarm.
This will give a ﬂuctuating level but will eliminate ﬂow ﬂuctuations. As there is no
LCV to restrict ﬂow at LLL then operators must physically reset the ﬂow controller tomaintain the surge volume. This has the disadvantage that the alarm condition couldbe missed or even ignored, resulting in possible damage to downstream equipment,and, in extreme cases, result in a ﬁre or explosion hazard.
(C)Control the surge liquid outlet on ﬂow control reset by a level control. This will
give a wandering level but a smooth outlet ﬂow. The LCV reset can still however cut
off the ﬂow completely on LLL.
(D)Control the outlet ﬂow by ﬂow control and the system feed by surge volume level.
This will give close level control and also close outlet ﬂow control. The outlet ﬂow
also will not be closed off by a LLL of the surge. In the case of the feed being thatto a fractionating tower level control on the feed stream could cause tower upsetconditions. This would be particularly undesirable on fractionators that operate closeto critical conditions such as de ethanizer.
(E)Control the surge liquid on level control to an intermediate surge vessel. The
liquid from the surge vessel may then be ﬂow controlled. This is the ideal method for
controlling feed to a ﬁred heater. The only question in this case is one of economics.
Level control rangeShould the decision now be to use an LC on the surge outlet (as in ‘ A’or ‘ E’above)
the range of the instrument needs to be determined. The range is the vertical distance528 CHAPTER 13
between the HLL and the LLL. Now if the liquid outlet is feeding another unit which
requires a smooth ﬂow it is possible to achieve this by using a wide proportional bandand a large range. The larger the instrument range and the wider the proportional bandthe less sensitive is the level controller. Consequently the ﬂow becomes smoother.However the larger the range, the more expensive is the controller and of course thelarger is the tower or vessel in order to accommodate the greater distance betweenHLL and LLL.
The selection of level control system and the level control range depends therefore on:
1.0 How many outlet streams are there from the surge vessel.
2.0 Which streams cannot tolerate complete shut off before all the available surge is
used.
3.0 The degree to which the outlet stream requires smooth ﬂow.
Pressure control for gases
Pressure control for gases is similar to level control for liquids in that it is really
a material balance control. If gas production rate varies, which is the usual case, apressure controller will relieve the system of gas by holding a given pressure in adrum or tower. In this case the entire space above the liquid level actually constitutesa surge volume.
Summary
There are two very general rules to follow in selecting a control system. These are:
rIf it is permissible for the product outﬂow rate to vary, use level control and a
relatively small amount of surge capacity.
rIf the product goes to a subsequent process where feed rate must be held constant,use ﬂow control and considerably more surge.
The control valve
Control valves are used throughout the process industry to motivate the control of the
operating parameters listed above."
"Figure 13.2 shows a conventional control valve which in this case is taken as a double
seated plug type valve. Like most control valves it is operated pneumatically by anair stream exerting a pressure on a diaphragm which in turn allows the movement ofa spring loaded valve stem. One or two plugs (the diagram shows two) are attached tothe bottom of the valve stem which, when closed, ﬁt into valve seats thus providingSUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 529

tight shut off. The progressive opening and closing of the plugs on the valve seats
due to the movement of the stem, determines the amount of the controlled ﬂuidﬂowing across the valve. The pressure of the air to the diaphragm controlling thestem movement is varied by a control parameter, such as a temperature measurement,or ﬂow measurement, or the like. In many of the more modern reﬁneries many controlvalves are operated electronically.
Figure 13.3 shows two other types of control valves in common service in the industry.
These are the venturi type and the butterﬂy type. Both these types when pneumaticallyoperated (which they usually are) work in the same way as described above for a plugtype valve. The major difference in these two types are in the valve system itself. Inthe case of the venturi the ﬂuid being controlled is subjected to a 90
◦angle change
in direction within the valve body. The inlet and outlet dimensions are also different,with the inlet having the larger diameter. The valve itself is plug type but seats in thebend of the valve body. Venturi type or angle valves are used in cases where thereexists a high-pressure differential between the ﬂuid at the inlet side of the valve andthat required at the outlet side.
Butterﬂy valves operate at very low-pressure drop across them. They can operate quite
effectively at only inches of water gauge pressure drop, and where the operation of theconventional plug type valves would be unstable. The action of this valve is by meansof a ﬂap in the process line. The movement of this ﬂap from open to shut is made bya valve stem outside the body itself. This stem movement, as in the case of the otherpneumatically operated valves, is provided by air and spring loads onto the stem froma diaphragm chamber. The only major disadvantage in this type of valve is the factthat very tight shut off is difﬁcult to obtain due to the ﬂap type action of the valve.SUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 531
The plug valve
There are two types of plug valves used for the conventional control valve function.
These are:
rSingle seated valves
rDouble seated valves
Single seated valves are inherently unbalanced so that the pressure drop across theplug affects the force required to operate the valve. Double seated valves are inherentlybalanced valves and are the ﬁrst choice in most services.
The conventional control valves predominantly in use can have either an equal percent-
age, or linear characteristics. The difference between these two is given in Figure 13.4.
With an equal percentage characteristic, equal incremental changes in valve stem lift
result in equal percentage changes in the ﬂow rate. For example if the lift were to
Figure 13.4. Control valve characteristics.532 CHAPTER 13
change from 20% to 30% of maximum lift the ﬂow at 30% would be about 50% more
than the ﬂow at 20%. Likewise, if the lift increases from 40% to 50% the ﬂow at 50%would be about 50% more than at 40%.
With a linear valve having a constant pressure drop across it, equal incremental
changes in stem lift results in equal incremental changes in ﬂow rate. For example,if the lift increases from 40% to 50% of maximum, the ﬂow rate changes from 40%to 50% of maximum. Thus equal percentage is the more desirable characteristic formost applications and is the one most widely used.
Pressure drop across control valves
In sizing or specifying the duty of the control valve the pressure drop across the
control valve must be determined for the design or maximum ﬂow rate. In addition,if it is known that a valve must operate at a ﬂow rate considerably lower than themaximum rate, the pressure drop at this lower ﬂow rate must also be calculated. Thiswill be required to establish the range ability of the valve.
As a general rule of thumb the sum of following pressure drops at maximum ﬂow
may be used for this purpose:
(a) 20% of the friction drop in the circuit
1(excluding the valve).
(b) 10% of the static pressure of the vessel into which the circuit discharges up to
pressures of 200 psig, 20 psig from 200 to 400 psig, and 5% above 400 psig.
The static pressure is included to allow for possible changes in the pressure level in"
"the system (i.e., by changing the set point on the pressure controller on a vessel). Thepercentage included for static pressure can be omitted in circuits such as recycle andreﬂux circuits in which any change in pressure level in the receiver will be reﬂectedthrough the entire circuit. In some circuits the control valve will have to take a muchgreater pressure drop than calculated from the percentages listed above. This occursin circuits where the control valve serves to bleed down ﬂuid from a high-pressuresource to a low-pressure source. Examples are pressure control valves releasing gasfrom a tower or streams going out to tankage from vessels operating at high pressure.These are the circumstances where venturi or angle valves are used, as describedearlier.
V alve action on air failure
In the analysis of the design and operation of any process or utility system the question
always arises on the action of control valves in the system on instrument air failure.
1A circuit generally includes all equipment between the discharge of a pump, compressor or vessel and
the next point downstream of which pressure is controlled. In most cases this latter point is a vessel.SUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 533
Should the control valve fail open or closed is the judgment decision based principally
on evaluating all aspects of safety and damage in each event. For example: controlvalves on ﬁred heater tube inlets should always fail open to prevent damage to thetubes through low or no ﬂow through them when they are hot. On the other handcontrol valves controlling fuel to the heaters should fail closed on air failure to avoidover heating of the heater during the air failure.
The failed action of the valve is established by introducing the motive air to either
above the diaphragm for a failed open requirement or below the diaphragm for a failedshut situation. The air failure to the valve above the diaphragm allows the spring topull up the plugs from the valve seats. Air failure to valves below the diaphragmforces the spring to seat the valves in the closed position.
Sizing a control valve
The sizing procedure for sizing control valves is given in Appendix 13.3 of this
chapter.
13.2 Offsite systems
In most reﬁneries the off sites facilities are often the major capital cost center second
only to the process plants themselves. Indeed in some instances where the off sitesinclude one or more complex jetties it can be the principal capital cost center. Amongthe major units found in most reﬁneries are:
rStorage
rProduct blending
rRoad and rail loading
rJetty facilities
rWaste disposal
rEfﬂuent water treating
Many reﬁneries consider that the ﬂare is part of the safety system. To a large extentthis is justiﬁable as most relief valves exhaust to the ﬂare as does the process andother vent systems. For the purpose of this publication however the ﬂare system isconsidered as part of the off sites and speciﬁcally comes under the section on wastedisposal.
Storage facilities
The crude oil feed and the processed products are stored in storage tanks of various
sizes and types. These tanks are usually collected and located together in the reﬁneryarea suitably deﬁned as ‘ The Tank Farm’ . There will be many other tanks (usually534 CHAPTER 13
Figure 13.5. Cone roof tank.
much smaller than those in the tank farm) which will contain chemicals to be used in
the processes and the slops or spent chemicals from the various processes and utilityplants. Most reﬁnery storage tanks fall into the following categories:
rAtmospheric storage
rPressure storage
rHeated storage
Atmospheric storage
As the name implies, all atmospheric storage tanks are open to the atmosphere, or are
maintained at atmospheric pressure by a controlled vapor blanket. These tanks fallinto two categories:
rCone roof tanks
rFloating roof tanks
Cone roofed tanks
Among the most common atmospheric storage tank is the cone roofed tank shown
in Figure 13.5. This tank is used for the storage of non-toxic liquids with fairlylow volatility. In its simplest form the roof of the tank will contain a vent, open toatmosphere, which allows the tank to “ breathe” when emptying and ﬁlling. A hatchSUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 535
Figure 13.6. Floating roof tank.
in the roof also provides access for sampling the tank contents. In oil reﬁning this
type of tank is used for the storage of gas oils, diesel, light heating oil, and the verylight lube oils (e.g., spindle oil).
In keeping with the company’ s ﬁre protection policy tanks containing ﬂammable
material will be equipped with foam and ﬁre water jets located around the base ofthe roof. All storage tanks containing ﬂammable material and material that couldcause environmental damage are contained within a dyked area or bund. The size ofthe bunded area is ﬁxed by law and is usually such as to contain the total contents ofone of the tanks included in the area. The number of tanks per bunded area is alsoﬁxed by legislation."
"Floating roofed tanks
Light volatile liquids may also be stored at essentially atmospheric pressure by the
use of “ Floating Roof ” tanks. A diagram of this type of storage tank is also given inFigure 13.6.
The roof of this tank literally ﬂoats on the surface of the liquid contents of the tank. In
this way the air space above the liquid is reduced to almost zero, thereby minimizingthe amount of liquid vaporization that can occur. The roof is specially designedfor this service and contains a top skin and a bottom skin of steel plate, held togetherby steel struts. These struts also provides strength and rigidity to the roof structure.The roof moves up and down the inside of the tank wall as the liquid level rises whenﬁlling and falls when emptying. The roof movement is enhanced by guide rollersbetween the roof edge and the tank wall. A scraper ring around the edge of the roof536 CHAPTER 13
top and pressed tightly against the tank wall ensures a seal between the contents and
the atmosphere. It also provides additional guide to the roof movement and stabilityto the roof itself.
When the tank reaches the minimum practical level for the liquid contents the roof
structure comes to rest on a group of pillars at the bottom of the tank. These providethe roof support when the tank is empty and a space between the roof and the tankbottom. This space is required to house the liquid inlet and outlet nozzles for ﬁllingand emptying the tank which, of course, must always be below the roof. The space isalso adequate to enable periodic tank cleaning and maintenance.
A hinged drain line running inside the tank from the roof to a “ below grade” sealed
drain provides the facility for draining the roof of rain water. The hinges in the drainline allows the line to move up and down with the roof movement. A pontoon typeaccess pier from the platform around the perimeter at the top of the tank providesaccess to the sample hatch located at the center of the roof. This “ pontoon”alsomoves upward and downward with the roof movement. Automatic bleeder vents areprovided on all ﬂoating roof tanks. They vent air from under a ﬂoating roof when thetank is being ﬁlled initially from empty. After the liquid rises high enough to ﬂoatthe roof off its supports, the vent automatically closes. Likewise when the tank isbeing emptied, the vent automatically opens just before the roof lands on its support,thereby preventing the development of a vacuum under the roof. Other accessoriesinclude rim vents, ﬂoat gauges, anti rotation devices, and manholes.
Liquids stored in this type of tank have relatively high volatilities and vapor pressures
such as gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, and the like. In oil reﬁning the break betweenthe use of cone roof tank and ﬂoating roof is based on “ ﬂash point” of the material.Flash point is that temperature above which the material will ignite or “ ﬂash” in thepresence of air. Normally this break point is 120
◦F.
Pressure storage
Pressure storage tanks are used to prevent or at least minimize the loss of the tank
contents due to vaporization. These types of storage tanks can range in operatingpressures from a few inches of water gauge to 250 psig. There are three major typesof pressure storage. These are:
rLow-pressure tanks— These are dome roofed tanks and operate at a pressures ofbetween 3 ins water gauge and 2.5 psig.
rMedium pressure tanks— These are hemispheroids which operate at pressures be-tween 2.5 and 5.0 psig, and spheriodal tanks which operate at pressures up to 15 psig.
rHigh-pressure tanks— These are either horizontal “ bullets”with elipsoidal orhemispherical heads or spherical tanks (spheres). The working pressures for theseSUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 537
types of tanks range from 30 to 250 psig. The maximum allowable is limited by
tank size and code requirements. For a 1,000 bbl sphere, the maximum pressure is215 psig, for a 30,000 bbl it is 50 psig. These pressure limits can be increased ifthe tank is stress relieved.
Although it is possible to store material in tanks with pressure in excess of 250psig normally when such storage is required refrigerated storage is usually a betteralternate.
Heated storage tanks
Heated storage tanks are more common in the petroleum industry than most others.
They are used to store material whose ﬂowing properties are such as to restrict ﬂow atnormal ambient temperatures. In the petroleum industry products heavier than dieseloil, such as heavy gas oils, lube oil, and fuel oil are stored in heated tanks.
Generally speaking tanks are heated by immersed heating coils or bayonet type im-"
"mersed heaters. Steam is normally used as the heating medium because of its avail-ability in petroleum complexes. Very often where immersed heating is used the tankis agitated usually by side located propeller agitators for large tanks. Where externalcirculating heating is used for tanks, the contents are mixed by means of jet mixing.Here the hot return stream is introduced into the tank via a specially designed jet noz-zle as shown in Figure 13.7. External tank heating is used when there is a possibilityof a hazardous situation occurring if an immersed heater leaks.
Figure 13.7. A jet mixing nozzle.538 CHAPTER 13
Calculating heat loss and heater size for a tank
Heat loss and the heater surface area to compensate for the heat loss may be calculated
using the following procedure:
Step 1. Establish the bulk temperature for the tank contents. Fix the ambient air
temperature and the wind velocity normal for the area in which the tank is to be sited.
Step 2. Calculate the inside ﬁlm resistance to heat transfer between the tank contents
and the tank wall. The following simpliﬁed equation may be used for this:
hc=8.5(/Delta1t /µ)0.25
where
hc=Inside ﬁlm resistance to wall in Btu/hr sqft◦F.
/Delta1t=Temperature difference between the tank contents and the wall in◦F.
µ=The viscosity of the tank contents at the bulk temperature in cps.
The heat loss calculation is iterative with assumed temperatures being made for
the tank wall.
Step 3. Using the assumed wall temperature made in step 2 calculate the heat loss to
atmosphere by radiation using Figure 13.8. Then calculate the heat loss from thetank wall to the atmosphere using Figure 13.9. Note the temperature difference inthis case is that between the assumed wall temperature and the ambient air tem-perature. Correct these ﬁgures by multiplying the radiation loss by the emissivityfactor given in Figure 13.8. Then correct the heat loss by convection ﬁgure by thefactors as described in item 4 below.
Step 4. The value of h
coread from Figure 13.9 is corrected for wind velocity and for
shape (vertical or horizontal) by multiplying by the following shape factors:
Vertical plates 1.3Horizontal plates 2.0 (facing up)
1.2 (facing down)
Correction for wind velocity use

w=F1+F2
where
Fw=wind correction factor
F1=wind factor @ 200◦F calculated from:

F2=Read from Figure 13.10
Then the corrected hcois:
hco×shape correction ×Fw.SUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 539
Figure 13.8. Heat loss by radiation.
Step 5. The resistance of heat transferred from the bulk of the contents to the wall
must equal the heat transferred from the wall to the atmosphere. Thus:
Heat transferred from the bulk to the wall =‘a’
=hcfrom step 2 ×/Delta1tin Btu/hr ·sqft.
where /Delta1tin this case is (bulk temp— assumed wall temp)540 CHAPTER 13
Figure 13.9. Heat loss to atmosphere by natural convection.
Figure 13.10. Plot of ‘ F2’v ersus surface temperature.SUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 541
Heat transferred from the wall to the atmosphere =‘b’
=(hco+hr)×/Delta1tin Btu/hr sqft
where /Delta1tin this case is (assumed wall temp— air temp).
Step 6. Plot the difference between the two transfer rates against the assumed wall
temperature. This difference (‘ a’−‘b’ ) will be negative or positive but the wall
temperature that is correct will be the one in which the difference plotted =0.
Make a last check calculation using this value for the wall temperature.
Step 7. The total heat loss from the wall of the tank is the value of ‘ a’ or ‘ b’ calculated
in step 6 times the surface area of the tank wall. Thus:
Qwall=hc×/Delta1t×(πDtank×tank height) in Btu/hr.
Step 8. Calculate the heat loss from the roof in the same manner as that for the wall
described in steps 2–7. Note the correction for shape factor in this case will be for
horizontal plates facing upward, and the surface area will be that for the roof.
Step 9. Calculate the heat loss through the ﬂoor of the tank by assuming the ground
temperature as 50◦F and using;
hf=1.5 Btu/hr sqft◦F
Step 10. Total heat loss then is:
Total heat loss from tank =Qwall+Qroof+Qﬂoor.
Step 11. Establish the heating medium to be used. Usually this is medium pressure
steam. Calculate the resistance to heat transfer of the heating medium to the outsideof the heating coil or tubes. If steam is used then take the condensing steam valuefor h as 0.001 Btu/hr sqft
◦F . Take value of steam fouling as .0005 and tube metal
resistance as 0.0005 also. The outside fouling factor is selected from the following:
Light hydrocarbon =0.0013
Medium hydrocarbon =0.002
Heavy Hc such as fuel oils =0.005
The resistance of the steam to the tube outside =1
h+R
where R=rsteam fouling +rtube metal +routside fouling .
Step 12. Assume a coil outside temperature. Then using the same type of iterative
calculation as for heat loss, calculate for ‘ a’as the heat from the steam to the coil
outside surface in Btu/hr sqft. That is
‘a’=h×/Delta1ti"
"Calculate for ‘ b’as the heat from the coil outside surface to the bulk of the tank
contents. Use Figure 13.11 to obtain ho and again ‘ b’is ho×/Delta1towhere the /Delta1tois
the temperature between the tube outside and that of the bulk tank contents. Makefurther assumptions for coil outside temperature until ‘ a’=‘b’ .
Step 13. Use ‘ a’or ‘ b’from step 12 which is the rate of heat transferred from the
heating medium in btu/hr sqft and divide this into the total heat loss calculated542 CHAPTER 13
Figure 13.11. Convection heat transfer coefﬁcient.
in step 10. The answer is the surface area of the immersed heater required for
maintaining tank content’ s bulk temperature.
An example calculation using this technique is given as Appendix 13.1 at the end ofthis chapter.
Product blending facilities
Blending is the combining of two or more components to produce a desired end
product. The term in reﬁnery practice usually refers to process streams being combinedto make a saleable product leaving the reﬁnery. Generally these include gasolines,middle distillates such as: jet fuel, kerosene, diesel, and heating oil. Other blendedSUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 543
ﬁnished products will include various grades of fuel oil and lube oil. The blending
of the process streams is accomplished either by batch blending in blending tanks orin-line blending in the pipe line itself.
In-line versus batch blendingIn batch blending the components are routed separately into a single receiver tank.
They are mixed in this tank to meet the ﬁnished product speciﬁcation. In the case onin-line blending the component streams are routed through automatically operatedﬂow valves to a ﬁnished product tank. With modern computerized control technologyin-line blending is becoming the more common form of blending process. In the caseof gasolines and lube oils in particular in-line blending is extensively the acceptedmethod. Middle distillates and residuum blending by batch has still some advantagebecause there are much fewer components to be handled, although the quantitiesinvolved are usually greater.
The in-line blender operationAn in-line blender is essentially a multiple stream controller with feed-back. The
controller itself is a computer into which the recipe for the blend is keyed. Suchblending recipes have been covered in some detail in Chapter 1 of this Handbook.The controller automatically starts the pumps for the blend components and moti-vates the ﬂow control valves on the component lines to meet the required componentquantities. In most cases the component lines join together to form the blended prod-uct which is then routed to the ﬁnished product tank. A series of on line analyzerslocated in the blend run down lines, monitor the ﬁnished product properties and inturn, reset the controller adjusting the component quantities to meet the end productspeciﬁcation.
The in-line blender designMost reﬁnery companies have their own proprietary component blending recipes for
their ﬁnished products. These will be in computer program form and usually utilizingthe linear programming techniques described in Chapter 8 of this Handbook. It is thisprogram software that is installed into the blender controller to activate the respectivecomponent systems. The blender controller acts to start the selected pumps and thecontrol valves. It also receives data from the on line analyzers located in the productrun down line.
The design of the blending system as a whole is the combined effort of the pro-
cess engineer, the instrument engineer, and the computer specialist. It will be theduty of the process engineer to develop the blending recipe in terms of componentpercentages and quantities to meet a particular product speciﬁcation. The instrumentengineer will ensure that the control valves, pump starting assembly and the on stream544 CHAPTER 13
analyzers meet the process requirements. A typical list of the instrument engineer’ s
responsibilities in this regard are as follows:
rThe control panel, panel instruments, instrument power supply, annunciators pumpstart push buttons, indicating lights, graphic display and all panel wiring
rTurbine meters and pre-ampliﬁers
rControl valves with positioners
rStream analyzers
rField transmitters (ﬂow, temperature, pressure)
Finally it will be the computer specialist’ s duty to translate these requirements intothe software program for the controller computer.
Component tankageBecause the in line blender permits the rapid conversion of the components to ﬁnished
products, the ratio of component to ﬁnished product tankage should be quite large.For good ﬂexibility this ratio should be 4 or 5 to 1.
The most signiﬁcant process requirement for successful blending is that the properties"
"of the individual components do not change during the blending operation. Alkylatesand catalytically cracked naphtha vary little unless feed or operation are changed.Reformates and straight run naphtha however have a greater variability due to changesin source crude feed quality. These are often stored in separate “ running gage” tankage
the quality of the contents of which are tested when full.
Lube oils are a particular problem in component storage, because of the tendency of
the oils to ‘ stratify’ . That is these oils tend to separate in storage with the heavier
gravity and viscosity portion of the oil sinking to the tank bottom. In most casesthe contents of these tanks are continually mixed using propeller type mixers. Manycompanies adopt this system to all heavy component tankage such as gas oils, andfuel oil product components.
Finished product tankageFinished product tankage is needed even with the most efﬁcient in line blender. This
is because of required product disposal rates, and product certiﬁcation. However inmany design cases, in-line blending will still only require about one half the productstorage required by batch blending.
Actual requirements of product tankage will usually be dictated by the manner in
which the product is to be shipped from the reﬁnery. The blend rate is usually sized toblend a day’ s production in a certain number of hours. The maximum rate of an eco-nomically sized blender will usually be too slow to blend into an ocean going tanker.SUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 545
Thus, product tankage and loading pumps are needed to supplement the blender. Con-
versely, the minimum rate of a blender will usually be too fast to blend directly intoa road tanker. In some cases however this is done by limited volume transfer pumpstaking suction directly from component tankage.
Road and rail loading facilities
The extent of product shipping facilities required in a chemical or petroleum complex
depends on the size of the complex, the local market, the number of different productsto be shipped and the market to be supplied. Normally the shipping facilities installedin most plants is sufﬁcient to cater for normal product handling and the ﬂexibilityrequired for seasonal demands. The capacity of these facilities will almost invariablyexceed the plant’ s total production.
The most common method of shipping product is by road or rail in suitably designed
tanker cars. In the case of large complexes located on coastal or river side sites shippingby barge or ships carry the bulk of the plant products. This section however will dealonly with dispatch by road and rail.
Loading rates
Loading rates for road and rail tankers vary from as low as 150 GPM to as high as
1,000 GPM, but most terminals load at rates between 300 to 550 GPM. Road tankershave capacities from 1300 to 6500 gals and one tractor can haul two 6500 gals tanks.The number of loading arms required for each product to be loaded varies with:
rTruck size
rNumber of loading hours per day
rNumber of loading days per week
rTime for positioning, hook up, and depositioning of the truck.
Figure 13.12 gives the number of arms or spouts required for loading a 3,500 galtruck under various conditions.
The conditions shown in Figure 13.12 is for ﬁlling at a rate of 300 GPM (bottom
curve) and for 500 GPM (top curve). The loading time is taken as the ﬁlling time pertank truck plus 10 minutes. Thus loading time is:
Tank truck capacity gals
GPM+10 minutes
Tank car capacity is taken as 3,500 Gallons. Thus for the lower curve loading timeis 22 minutes per car, and for the upper curve 17 minutes per car. Assuming that asingle product is loaded over 4 hr in an 8 hr day 5 days a week then number of trucks546 CHAPTER 13
Figure 13.12. Number of loading arms for quantity shipment.
required per Barrel/Day is:
B/D×42×5d a y s ×8 hr/day
3500 gals/truck ×20 hr loading per week=0.024 trucks per Barrel/Day.
Then for 1000 B/D number of trucks per working day =0.024×1000
=24 Trucks/day of 4 hr ﬁlling.
Time to load trucks at 300 GPM ﬁlling rate =24×22 minutes =528 minutes.
To complete loading in 4 hrs the number of arms required =528
240=2.2
Continuing with this calculation for several more shipping capacities and for ﬁlling
rates of 300 and 500 GPM produces the data given in Figure 13.12.
Loading equipment
Figure 13.13 is a schematic drawing for a typical road or rail loading facility.The loading pumps which are located close to the product storage tanks take suction
from these tanks. The loading pumps are high capacity, low head type with ﬂathead/capacity characteristic. They operate at between 35 and 45 psi differential head.SUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 547
Figure 13.13. Schematic diagram of a loading facility.
These pumps discharge through an air eliminator drum into the loading header. Several"
"loading arm assemblies are connected to the loading header. Each of these assembliesinclude a remote operated block valve followed by a desurger (optional), then astrainer located before the loading meter. The product ﬂows from the meter into aswivel jointed loading arm and nozzle. Tank trucks and rail cars are loaded throughtheir top hatches into which the nozzles of the loading arm ﬁt.
Air eliminators are used to disengage air and other vapors which would interfere with
the accuracy of the meters. Disengaging of the vapors is accomplished at about 3 psig.Should there not be sufﬁcient static head at the disengaging vessel a back pressurevalve must be provided to obtain this pressure. The meters are positive displacementtype and desurgers are installed to decrease hydraulic shock resulting from quickshutoff.
Loading facilities arrangement
Figures 13.14 and 13.15 show the arrangement of loading facilities for truck and
railcar, respectively.
The dimensions shown on the diagram are applicable to one world area and may not
be applicable to other localities. The equipment and its arrangement shown in thediagrams however are standard for most of these facilities.548 CHAPTER 13

In truck loading the meters and strainers are located at the loading station. The con-
nection of the loading arm is made by an operator actually standing on the car itself.In the case of the truck loading facilities the loading arm is operated from an adjacentplatform. As in the case of the truck loading the meter and strainer together with theon/off valve is located on the loading site.

Jetty and dock facilities
Tankers and barges are loaded and unloaded at jetties or docks. In almost all circum-
stances these facilities for handling petroleum products are separate from those usedfor general cargo. Very often tankers, particularly the modern ‘ Super’tankers areloaded and unloaded by submarine pipelines at deep water anchorage. This sectionof the chapter however deals only with onshore docking facilities.
Jetty size, access, and location
Tanker sizes range from small coastal vessels of 10,000 bbl capacity to super tankers
in excess of 250,000 bbl capacity. The more common tanker size is one of 140,000 bblcapacity and this size tanker is labeled a T2. This tanker is usually used for productcarrying. It can carry as much as three different product parcels at the same time. Thelarger tankers are usually used for crude oil transportation.
Ideally the jetty size should be sufﬁcient to cater for both these size tankers, and
usually at least one of each size at the same time. In some reﬁneries which havejetty facilities these usually include barge loading items also. The barge loadingmay however be located on remote docking facilities from the larger sea goingtankers.
The location of the jetty itself must consider the following:
rThere is sufﬁcient deep water to cater for the larger crude carrying tanker
rIt is located as close as possible to the reﬁnery’ s tank farm
rIt is in an area that has a good approach road and park
rThere is sufﬁcient room for a product/crude pipe-way
rThere is sufﬁcient waterway in which to maneuver and handle tanker docking
A fully loaded T2 tanker has a maximum draft of 30 ft. The larger crude carrying
tanker would have a maximum draft around 45 ft. It is important to minimize rundownpipe lengths to and from the jetty loading area and the reﬁnery tank farm. The ﬁrstis the piping cost factor and the second is that often the pumping characteristics mayhave a negative static head during the pumping program.
A good onshore jetty approach road is mandatory for the operation of the jetty. This
is required for safety reasons and the easy approach way for emergency vehicles(such as ﬁre engines and ambulances). The approach road is also required for thetransportation of the operating staff, ship’ s crew, and the ships chandler vehicles.Usually this approach road is dedicated for jetty use and will be quite independent ofany adjacent reﬁnery road.550 CHAPTER 13
There must be room on shore and on the jetty itself for the loading and unloading pipe
way(s). This can be quite extensive depending on the reﬁnery size and the number ofproducts that are exported. There are several options for the location and size of thispipe way conﬁguration. On the jetty itself it maybe carried on overhanging supportson both sides of the jetty pier or it can be supported by an independent pipe rackadjacent to the jetty pier (much more expensive however), and this pipe rack could bemultitiered. On shore the pipe way can be located along the roadway at ground levelor elevated with two or more tiers. It could also be elevated and run above the roadway.This does however restrict access by limiting vehicle height using the roadway.
Finally the location of the jetty must allow sufﬁcient waterway room for tankers to"
"be berthed properly. Tankers arriving from the open sea must have room so that tugscan handle and turn the ship around to face open sea before tying up at the jetty.
A layout plan of a typical tanker jetty is shown below as Figure 13.16.EquipmentThe equipment required for tanker loading include pumps, hose or ﬂexible loading
pipe, and handling cranes or structures. The loading pumps are located at the tankfarm. These are centrifugal type with discharge pressures in excess of 100 psig. Thisis dependant on rundown pipe lengths, but pressure drop through the loading hosesor ﬂexible loading pipes are within 10–25 psig. Also, and as mentioned earlier thereis often a static head loss to the deck manifold of an empty tanker.
When a rubber hose is used, it is supported by a dockside derrick plus the tanker boom.
Some installations employ a combination of hose and pipe or ﬂexible assembliesof pipe and swivel joints supported by structures. Automatic adjustment for tideand tanker draft is incorporated in this equipment. Hose and various assemblies areavailable in sizes from 2 to 12 inches diameter with the 8 and 10 inch most frequentlyused for products.
Barges are usually loaded through hoses supported by dockside derricks or, in some
cases by derricks on the barges. To conserve space barges are frequently moored twoor three abreast with the loading hose being manhandled across the in board bargesto the outboard barge. This hose is accordingly limited in size to a 6 inch diameterweighing about 8 lb/ft.
Loading ratesTanker piping and pumping systems are designed for relatively high rates. The un-
loading pumps for the T2 tanker size can handle up to 8,000 bph. Super tankersunloading crude have pumps that can handle quantities of 22,000 bph or more. ASUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 551

practice to load two products simultaneously. Loading rates for barges are usuallylimited to 2,000 bph. Barges have capacities ranging from 600 to 2,000 bbl. Bargesare ﬂat bottomed shallow draft vessels used to transport products short distances incanals, harbors, or inland waterways.
Quantities loaded aboard tankers are measured by metering storage tanks and tanker
compartments. Products loaded into barges are measured by metering. Meters arelocated on the dock near the hose connections. These metering facilities includestrainers, and ﬂow controllers.552 CHAPTER 13
Other features
Some of the other features that are considered in the establishing of jetty facilities are:
rShip ballast handling
rTanker mooring facilities
rSlop and spill collection facilities
rLighting and communication facilities
Ship ballast water is handled using specially allocated on shore tanks to collect the
water which will of course be contaminated. This contamination will be the petroleumproduct residue remaining in the ships tanks after product unloading. Ships arrivingat the reﬁnery jetty under ballast are usually the smaller product tankers. These arethe vessels that will load at the reﬁnery with the ﬁnished products for shipment. Theballast water is pumped from the ships tanks to the onshore ballast water tankage bythe ships pumps. From the ballast water tanks the content is drained off to the reﬁnery’ sefﬂuent treating facilities. The hydrocarbon contaminants are removed from the waterin the treating plant and routed to the reﬁneries slop system to ﬁnally enter the reﬁneryprocesses. The treated efﬂuent water is drained back to the sea.
The length of the jetty’ s loading/unloading wharf where the ships are moored are sized
to accommodate two or more tankers of ﬁxed length (say two T2’ s). The allocatedspace for these vessels must conform to standard conditions usually established by theparticular Port Authority Regulations. One of these regulations which sets the lengthof the wharf is that the space between moored vessels should be such that the sternand aft mooring lines of adjacent vessels measured at an angle of 45
◦to the center
line of the vessels do not overlap.
Slop and spill facilities around loading or unloading vessels at the wharf may be
contained by a temporary boom installed around the vessel during these operations.Any spillage is contained by the boom and is subsequently disposed of by the sameroute as the ballast water.
Jetty lighting is based on the main reﬁnery lighting code and practice. This means"
"that all access ways and roads will have general street lighting. Areas where personnelare employed on a 24 hr basis will be ﬂood lit between the hours of sun set and sunrise. This lighting will be supplemented by the ships lighting facilities as requiredfor loading/unloading activities and for ship berthing and departure. Ship to onshorecommunication by means of telephone. radio, and company computer systems areactivated as soon as the ship has been berthed.
Waste disposal facilities
All process plants including oil reﬁneries produce large quantities of toxic and/or
ﬂammable material during periods of plant upset or emergencies. A properly designedSUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 553
ﬂare and slop handling system is therefore essential to the plant operation. This section
describes and discusses typical disposal systems currently in use in the oil reﬁningindustry where the hydrocarbon is immiscible with water. Where the chemical ismiscible in water special separation systems must be used.
Figure 13.17 shows a completely integrated waste disposal system for the light end
section of an oil reﬁnery. The system shown here consists of three separate collectionsystems being integrated to a ﬂare and a slops rerun system. A fourth system is for thedisposal of the oily water drainage with a connection to the ﬂare and a separate connec-tion for any oil laden skimming. This later connection would be to route the skimmedoil to the reﬁnery slop tanks. In the three integrated systems, the ﬁrst collects all thevapor efﬂuent streams from the relief headers. The contents of this stream will be ma-terial normally vapor at ambient conditions. It would be the collection of the vaporsfrom the relief valve and the vapor venting on plant shut down or upset conditions. Thesecond of the three systems is the liquid hydrocarbon drainage. The material in thissystem is liquid under normal ambient conditions and is collected from drain headersused to evacuate vessels during shutdown or upset conditions. Both the ﬁrst and thesecond collection systems are routed to the ﬂare knockout drum. The second (liquidsystem) may also be routed to the light ends slop storage drum. The liquid phase fromthe ﬂare knockout drum is also routed to the slops storage drum. The third systemis the light ends feed diversion. This allows the light ends unit to be bypassed tem-porarily by sending the feed to the slop drum for rerunning later.
Further description and discussion of these disposal systems is given in the following
sections:
rBlow-down and slop disposal
rFlares
Blow-down and slop
This system generally consists of the following drums:
rNon-condensable blow-down drum
rCondensable blow-down drum
rWater disengaging drum
A typical non-condensable blow-down drum is shown in Figure 13.18. These types of
drums are provided for handling material normally in the vapor state and high volatilityliquids. These drums receive and disengage liquid from safety valve headers, and drainheaders. These drums are often referred to as ﬂare knockout drums as the disengagedvapor is routed directly to a ﬂare. The drum is basically a surge drum and thereforeshould be sized as one using the following criteria:
1.0 Normal liquid surge is based on the daily liquid draw-off to drain per operating
day of 24 hr. This includes spillage, sample point draining, etc.Figure 13.17. An integrated water disposal system.Figure 13.18. A non-condensable blow down drum.556 CHAPTER 13
2.0 The surge capacity between the HLSO (High Level Shut Off) for normal drainage
and the HLSO for feed diversion should be such as to contain the total feed to
a unit routed to this drum for a period sufﬁcient to shutdown the unit producingthe feed stream. Should there be more than one unit routed to the drum then thissurge capacity should be for the largest of a single feed streams.
3.0 The capacity between the highest HLSO and the high level alarm (HLA) should
be sized to handle the largest liquid volume that can be discharged in 30 minutesby the relief valves constituting any single risk.
4.0 The drum must be sized for a vapor velocity above the HLA at a maximum of
100% of the critical ﬁgure calculated by:
V=0.157√(ρ
l−ρv)/ρ v
where
V=critical velocity in ft/sec
ρl=liquid density in lbs/cuft
ρv=vapor density in lbs/cuft at drum conditions of pressure and temperature.
Drum pressure. The maximum operating pressure for this drum will be about 0.5psig or that of the water disengaging drum tied to the same ﬂare header.
Condensable blow-down drum and system is used for collection and containmentof heavier hydrocarbons with low volatility. For example this would account for themiddle and waxy distillates (kerosene, gas oils, and the like).
Figure 13.19 shows a typical blow-down drum and quench. The material entering"
"this system is generally above ambient temperatures. Very often hot streams directlyfrom operating units ﬁnd their way into this system. To handle these materials thecondensable blow-down drum is designed as a direct contact quench drum. The blow-down material leaves the unit in a drain collection system to enter the bottom sectionof the drum. Cooling water is introduced at the top of the drum and passes over abafﬂed tray section to contact the hot blow-down stream at the drum base. Any hotvapors rising from the blow-down stream are condensed in the bafﬂe section of thedrum and carried down to the bottom of the drum. Uncondensed material leaving thetop of the vessel is routed to the ﬂare. The aqueous mixture containing the condensedblow-down leaves the bottom of the drum through a seal system to enter the chemicalor oily water sewer for separation and treatment.
The following criteria is used to size this vessel:
rThe vapor load on the drum is based on the safety valve(s) constituting the largest
single risk
rThe maximum operating pressure for the drum is usually 1–2 psig
rThe stack may vent to atmosphere rather than the ﬂare if desired. However if ventedto atmosphere the stack should vent at least 10 ft above the highest adjacent structure.SUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 557
Figure 13.19. A typical blow down drum with quench.
In any case the vent should not release to atmosphere below 50 ft above grade.
Snufﬁng steam should also be provided.
rThe cooled efﬂuent leaving the drum should be at 150◦F or colder. The cold water
supply should be controlled either by efﬂuent temperature or inlet blow-down streamﬂow. There should however be a bypass ﬂow of water entering the drum at all times.
rThe drain system from the unit(s) to the drum should be free draining into the drum.The drum therefore should be located at a minimum height to grade. Where verywaxy materials are likely to be handled, steam tracing of lines and a steam coil inthe drum should be considered.558 CHAPTER 13
Figure 13.20. A water separation drum.
The water separation drum arrangement is shown in Figure 13.20. The purpose of this
drum is to remove any volatile and combustible material from certain water efﬂuentstreams before they enter the sewer system.
Thus:
rAll water from distillate drums which have been in direct contact with ﬂammable
material such as light hydrocarbons are sent to the disengaging drum before disposalto the sewer. The exception is where a sour water stripper is included in the plant;then these streams are sent to this stripper.
rCooling water drainage from coolers and condensers which may have been contam-inated with ﬂammable high volatility material are sent to the disengaging drum. Sotoo are steam condensate streams which fall in the same category.
The drum is located at a minimum height above grade. It operates at about 0.5 psigand vents into the ﬂare system. The pressure and the liquid level in the drum aremaintained by the free draining of the efﬂuent through a suitable seal.
Design criteria used for the sizing of this drum are as follows:
rThe vapor load on the drum will be the result of high volatile material ﬂashing to
equilibrium conditions at the drum pressure. This design load is based on the largestSUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 559
amount of vapor arising from a single contingency. For exchangers this contingency
will be due to a fractured tube. For liquid from a distillate drum this will be due toa failed open control valve on the water outlet.
rThe liquid seal must be such as to eliminate air from the sewer system and to allowfree drainage from the drum.
rAn oil or chemical skimming valve is located at the water NLL. This allows for thedraw off of the oil phase from time to time. A high interface level alarm is oftenincluded.
The ﬂare
Vapors collected in a closed safety system are disposed of by burning at a safe location.
The facilities used for this burning are called ﬂares. The most common of these ﬂaresused in industry today are:
rThe elevated ﬂare
rThe multi jet ground ﬂare
The elevated ﬂare is used where some degree of smoke abatement is required. Theﬂare itself operates from the top of a stack usually in excess of 150 ft high. Steam isinjected into the gas stream to be burnt to complete combustion and thereby reducethe smoke emission.
The multi-jet ground ﬂare is selected where luminosity is a problem. For example at
locations near housing sites. In this type of ﬂare the vapors are burned within the ﬂarestack thus considerably reducing the luminosity. Steam is again used in this type ofﬂare to reduce the smoke emission.
Figure 13.21 shows a typical arrangement of an elevated ﬂare and Figures 13.22 and
13.23 shows that for a multi jet ground ﬂare.
The elevated ﬂareThis type of ﬂare is the normal choice in the larger process industries such as the"
"petroleum reﬁning industry. It consists of a ﬂare stack over 150 feet in height thatcontains an ignitor system, a pilot ﬂame, and the ﬂare pipe itself. The ﬂare headerenters the stack through a water seal at the base of the stack immediately above ananchor of concrete plinth. The water seal maintains a back pressure of around 0.5psig on the ﬂare header. The waste gas to be ﬂared moves up the stack to exit at thetop. At the stack top there is an assembly of ignitor and pilot gas which ensures thesafe burning of the waste ﬂare gasses. This assembly is shown in Figure 13.24. Itconsists of three tubes all external to the stack itself and each supplied with the plantfuel gas. The ﬁrst and largest of these tubes is the ignitor. Here the fuel gas supply560 CHAPTER 13
Figure 13.21. An elevated ﬂare.
is mixed with air (plant or instrument air supply) before passing upwards through a
venturi tube to an igniter chamber. A spark is induced in the ignitor chamber by anelectric current of 15 Amp. The chamber and the venturi tube are located near gradeand a sight glass on the ignitor chamber enables the operator to check on the ignitor’ soperation. The ﬂame front from the ignitor travels up the ignitor tube to contact thewaste gasses that are to be ﬂared as they exit the top of the ﬂare stack. The same ﬂameSUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 561

front ignites the “ On and Off ” pilot burner which is the center tube of the three and
initially ignites the permanent pilot burner at the stack top. The outlets of these threetubes are located at the stack top such that the prevailing wind ensures that the ﬂamefrom them is blown across the stack exit.
Steam is often injected into the stack at some point near the top to complete combustion
and eliminate or at least reduce smoke emission. The amount of steam normallyused for this purpose depends on the character or composition of the waste gasses.Aromatics and oleﬁns when burnt produce a smokey ﬂame: steam injection allowsthe free carbon which makes up the smoke to convert into CO and CO
2which of
course are invisible gasses. An estimate of the amount of steam required for smokeabatement is given in Figure 13.25.
A clear space around an elevated ﬂare is required to allow for the effect of heat
radiation from the ﬂare to the ground. Flares which have a heat release of 300 million562 CHAPTER 13
Figure 13.23. Multi jet ﬂare plan with seal details.
to 1 billion btu/hr should be located at least 200 ft from the plant property line, or any
pond, separator, tankage, or any equipment that could be ignited by a falling spark.The stack also must have a spacing of at least 500 ft from any structure or plant whoseelevation is within 125 ft of the ﬂare tip.
The elevated ﬂare stack is designed to maintain a gas velocity of between 100 and
160 ft/sec during a major blow-down to ﬂare. This rate is based on the maximumsingle emergency plus any steam added to improve the burning characteristics. Abovea velocity of 160 ft/sec noise becomes a problem and the maintenance of ignition alsois dubious unless multiple ignition tubes are used. Some proprietary ﬂare tip designshowever do claim ability to handle satisfactorily velocities up to 400 ft/sec.
The multi-jet ground ﬂare
The multi-jet ﬂare provides a completely noiseless, non-luminous ﬂaring at a reason-able cost. At normal loads the ﬂare is also essentially smokeless and is particularlyuseful where continuous ﬂaring is required. Figures 13.22 and 13.23 show the el-evation of the ﬂare stack and the plan arrangement of a two stage multi-jet ﬂare,respectively.
The two stage arrangement shown here shows the ﬂare header being directed to one
of two seal drums or to both. The ﬁst stage seal drum operates at a back pressure of20 ins of water at the ﬁrst stage burners at its design capacity. The second stage burnersSUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 563

are activated when the pressure in the ﬂare header reaches 30 ins of water gauge. Very
often, particularly in large process complexes, the ground ﬂare is designed to operatein conjunction with an elevated ﬂare. The multi-jet ﬂare takes a gas stream up to say80% of its rated capacity additional ﬂow is then diverted to an elevated ﬂare system.Thus, if there is need for the continuous ﬂaring of a reasonably small quantity, theground ﬂare caters for it. In an emergency or surge the elevated ﬂare comes intooperation automatically to take the additional load.564 CHAPTER 13
Figure 13.25. Approximate amount of steam for smoke abatement.
The burners of a multi-jet ﬂare are jet nozzles approximately 15 ins in length of 1 ins
diam stainless steel pipe. They discharge vertically from the horizontal burner lineswhich run across the bottom of the stack. The number of jets is based on gas velocityand is expressed by the equation:
N=16.4V
where
N=number of Jets
V=ﬂare design capacity in mmScf/day."
"The jets are placed on a square or rectangular pitch of 18 to 24 ins. A ﬁrst estimateof the required pitch may be obtained from the expression:

NC
where
P=pitch in ins
D=stack ID in feet
N=number of jets
C=distance between burner center lines in insSUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 565
No jet should be placed closer than 12 ins to the inside of the stack.
The inside diameter of the stack is based on the rate of heat release at design capacity.
It is calculated using the following equation:
D=0.826 Q5
where
D=stack inside diameter in feet
Q=heat release at max design in mm Btu/hr.
The stack height for diameters up to 25 ft is 32 ft and the steel shell of the stack islined with 4
/prime/primeof refractory material. A wind breaker completes the construction of the
stack. This is necessary to prevent high wind gusts from extinguishing the ﬂames.
Flame holders are installed above the burners to prevent the ﬂames ‘ riding’up to
the top of the stack. These are simply solid rods of 1/prime/primerefractory material supported
horizontally above each burner line. The position of these ﬂame holders relative tothe bottom of the stack is critical to the proper operation of the burners. The stackitself is elevated to allow air for combustion to enter. The minimum space betweengrade and the bottom of the stack is set at 6 feet or 0.3D whichever is the larger.
As for any ﬂare a continuous pilot burner is recommended. The proper operation of
this pilot is important with respect to multi-jet type ﬂares because of the danger ofun-burnt ﬂammable material escaping outside the ﬂare at ground level. A gas pilot isprovided at each end of the primary burner to minimize this risk.
Efﬂuent water treating facilities
This section of the “ Offsite Systems”deals with the treating of waste water accu-
mulated in a chemical process complex before it leaves the complex. Over the yearsrequirements for safeguarding the environment have demanded close control on thequality of efﬂuents discharged from chemical and oil reﬁning plants. This includesefﬂuents that contain contaminants that can affect the quality of the atmosphere andthose that can be injurious to plant and other life in river waters and the surroundingseas. Efﬂuent management in the oil industry has therefore acquired a position ofimportance and responsibility to meet these environmental control demands.
Water efﬂuents that are discharged from the process and other units are collected
for treating and removal or conversion of the injurious contaminants. In most oilreﬁneries imported water in the form of ship’ s ballast water is also collected on shorefor treatment before discharging back to the sea. Figure 13.26 is a schematic of thewater efﬂuent treating system for a major European oil reﬁnery.Figure 13.26. A schematic of a water efﬂuent treating system.SUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 567
Normally the water efﬂuent treating facilities for a complex would be located at the
lowest geographical point in the plant. In this way very little pumping is required tomove the waste water to and from the treating plants. The schematic in Figure 13.26is for a reﬁnery that was sited below the sea level so more than the usual number ofpumps are used.
The contaminant that is to be removed in the system shown in Figure 13.26 is, of
course, oil. Five separate systems are used in this reﬁnery’ s treatment plant. The ﬁrstis that for handling ballast water from sea going tankers. The second is the handlingof clean water. This is included because the system bypasses all the treating processesexcept the last “ guard” process which, in this case, are the retention ponds. The thirdsystem is also for handling non-oily water but water that would be high in certainchemicals. This system also discharges into retention or storm water ponds. The wateris held in these ponds to ensure that there is no contamination. Should there be thenthe water would be returned into one or the other treating processes for removal ofthe contaminants.
The last two systems shown are for the handling of contaminated water from the
reﬁneries paved area, various tank and process plant drainage and the like. These oilywater systems and the ballast water stream are treated for oil removal. In the caseof the ballast water the water drained from the bottom of the holding tanks is routedthrough an API separator. This is a specially designed pond that reduces the forwardvelocity of the water stream to allow the separation of oil from the water by settlingor gravity.
The water/oil separation for the other reﬁnery streams takes place in a series of"
"settling pods. Final clean up in this case is accomplished by the use of parallel plateinterceptors and an air ﬂotation process. The principle of the parallel plate interceptoris to force the water stream to change direction several times in rapid sequence andthus “ knocking out” any oil entrained in the stream. The air ﬂotation unit causes thecontaminated water stream to be agitated so as to force the lighter oil phase to thesurface where it can be removed by skimming or by bafﬂed overﬂow.
Other treating processes
Most chemical plants and indeed a few oil reﬁning plants require more complex
methods for clarifying their efﬂuent water to meet environmental requirements for itsdisposal. The four more common methods are as follows:
rIn-line clariﬁcation using coagulation, ﬂocculation and ﬁltration
rPlain ﬁltration
rSedimentation
rChemically aided sedimentation using coagulation, ﬂocculation, and settling568 CHAPTER 13
Clariﬁcation is a process that removes suspended (usually organic) matter that gives
the stream color and turbidity. The removal of this matter especially in a colloidal form,requires the addition of chemicals to cause coagulation and ﬂocculation to promotesettling and separation of suspended solids. Coagulants and coagulant aids addedto the inﬂuent stream chemically react with impurities to form precipitates. These,together with particles of enmeshed turbidity, are ﬂocculated into larger masses thatare then readily separated from the bulk liquid.
There are essentially three steps in the chemically-aided clariﬁcation process. These
are:
rMixing of the additives
rFlocculation
rSettling
Coagulation encompasses the process of mixing the ﬁrst formation of agglomeratesthat form the ﬂoc. This is carried out in a series of separate compartments withthe settling basin occupying the largest volume. Coagulation is the singular mostimportant step in the clarifying process. Because it involves the build up of colloidaltype particles, the chemicals and the process rate are speciﬁc to the material that isto be clariﬁed. There are companies that specialize in the design construction andthe operation of this type of efﬂuent treating. These companies use their experiencein handling the complex electrochemical kinetics associated with ﬂocculation andcoagulation principles.
Utility Systems
All oil reﬁning processes require utilities in order to function. The more common
utility systems are:
rA steam and condensate system
rA fuel system
rWater systems including cooling water, potable water, and boiler feed water (BFW)
rA compressed air systems
rA power supply system.
The engineering and design of the ﬁrst four of these systems is usually the responsi-bility of a chemical engineer. On operating plants and processes the process engineerundertakes the responsibility for the correct and efﬁcient operation of utility facilities.The duties associated with the power systems are usually left to the Electrical Engi-neer or department, although the process engineer does have an input in the sizingof the system be developing a list of power requirement for all electrically motivatedequipment. This includes all motors and electrically operated equipment such as: thedesalter, product dehydrators, and the like.SUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 569
Brief descriptions of typical utility systems
The following paragraphs describe typical utility systems found in the oil reﬁning
industry. The details of these systems may vary from company to company but theirformat and general layout will be as described here. Only the ﬁrst four systems aredescribed and discussed here.
Steam and condensate systems
In most plants steam condensate accumulated in the various processes is collected
into a single header and returned to the steam generating plant. It is stored separateto the treated raw water because condensates may contain some oil contamination. Astream of treated water and condensate are taken from the respective storage tanksand pumped to the deaerator drum. The pumps in this case are usually vertical pumpsset in a pit near the storage tanks. The condensate stream passes through a simpleﬁlter on route to the deaerator to remove any oil contamination. The combined waterand condensate streams enter the top of a packed section of the deaerator drum.Low-pressure steam is introduced immediately below the packing in the drum toﬂow upwards countercurrent to the liquid streams. Any air entrained in the water isremoved by this counter current ﬂow of steam to be vented to atmosphere.
The deaerated BFW is pumped by the BFW pumps into the steam drum of the steam"
"generator. There will normally be three 60% pumps for this service. Two will beoperational and one will be on standby. Those pumps normally operating are usuallymotor driven while the standby pump is very often driven by an automatically startup diesel engine. These pumps are quite large in capacity operating at high head anddischarge pressure. The main steam lines in most plants are high-pressure (at least 700psig at the generator coil outlet), so the pump discharge pressure will be much greaterthan the HP steam outlet. These pumps are the most important in any chemical plant.If they fail no steam can be generated and the whole complex is in danger of totalshutdown or worse. Therefore three separate pumps are used to cater for the normalhigh head and high capacity, and a separate pump driver operating on a completelydifferent power source than electrical power or steam is mandatory to minimize thedanger of complete shut down.
The steam drum is located above the generator’ s ﬁrebox. The liquid in the drum ﬂows
through the generator’ s coils located in the ﬁrebox by gravity and thermo-syphon.A mixture of steam and water is generated in the coils and ﬂows back to the steamdrum. Here the steam and water are separated with the steam leaving the drum toenter the super-heater coil. The steam is heated to the plant’ s steam main temperaturein this coil and enters the high-pressure steam header for distribution to the varioususers. The steam pressure is controlled be a pressure controller on the steam outlet to570 CHAPTER 13
the header. Steam to the lower pressure headers is generated through turbines where
possible. Where lower pressure steam is required and it is not possible to produce itthrough equipment then let down stations are located in suitable places in the system.When steam pressure is reduced to the lower pressure headers the associated increaseof temperature above that speciﬁed for the lower pressure steam may need to bereduced. Desuperheaters are used for this purpose.
Desuperheaters consist of a chamber in the steam line into which cold condensate
is injected. These items are purchased equipment with specially designed injectionnozzles for the condensate. The amount of condensate delivered is controlled by thedownstream temperature of the steam. Desuperheaters are located at critical locationsof the plant where relatively large quantities of high-pressure steam are reduced tolow pressures such as the discharge from turbines.
The condensate return header is usually operated at a positive pressure of between
5 and 10 psig. The condensate is stored at atmospheric pressure, and very often thesmall amount of steam ﬂashed from the header pressure to the storage pressure isused in the deaerator instead of the low-pressure steam (the deaerator operates at ornear atmospheric pressure).
Figure 13.27 is a schematic ﬂow diagram of a typical steam generation unit.
Fuel systems
Most oil reﬁneries have two separate fuel systems. They have:
rA fuel gas system
rAnd a fuel oil system
The user burners in these plants are of the dual purpose design. They ﬁre either the
fuel gas or the fuel oil stream and can be easily switched over from one to the other.The pilot burners however must be fuel gas, and the system is designed such that ifthe pilot burner is extinguished the whole burner system is shutdown. Generally thedesign of the burner system in most plants have many safety and shutdown features.After all in processes that handle ﬂammable material the heater burners are the onefeature in the plant design that are a major ﬁre hazard source. Thus the design of theburner operation is such as to shutdown on:
rLow fuel pressure
rHigh process outlet temperature
rPilot burner extinguished
rAtomizing steam failure (oil burners)
rLow process feed to heaterFigure 13.27. A typical steam generation unit.572 CHAPTER 13
Fuel gas system
This is the simplest of the two systems. Waste gas streams from the process plants are
gathered and directed to the plant’ s fuel gas drum. This drum operates at 30 psig pres-sure and close to ambient temperature or 60
◦F . A small steam coil is usually installed
in the drum to gasify any “ below dew point” material that may have condensed out.The drum is held at the set pressure by pressure control valves which allows surplusgas to ﬂow to ﬂare and activates an emergency source of gas on low pressure. Thisemergency source may be in the form of imported liqueﬁed petroleum gas (LPG) orsome other plant gas stream that may be diverted to fuel. If LPG is used as a secondaryfuel source it is routed to the fuel gas drum via a vaporizer. This item of equipment isa kettle type re-boiler heating and vaporizing the LPG at the drum pressure. Mediumor low-pressure steam is used as the heating medium for the vaporizer.
The gas burner at the process ﬁred heater operates at or close to atmospheric pressure."
"The burner draws fuel from a separate header than that used to supply gas to the pilotburner. Many heaters contain an automatic switch over from gas ﬁring to fuel oil ﬁringon low gas ﬂows or when manually selected. The fuel gas system is “ dead ended” .That is there is no return system to the fuel gas drum, the gas header is pressured upand gas ﬂows to the burners by means of this differential pressure and intermediatecontrol valves. The fuel gas ﬂow to the heater burners is controlled by a temperaturecontrol valve activated by a temperature controller on the heater coil process outletline. The same controller also regulates the oil ﬁring arrangement when the heater isoperated on fuel oil.
Fuel oil systemFigure 13.28 is a schematic of a typical fuel oil system. Most plants use petroleum
residues as fuel oil. These types of fuel are high in viscosity and very often have a highpour point. (Pour point temperature is the temperature that the oil ceases to ﬂow.) Forthis reason the fuel oil is stored in insulated and heated cone roofed tanks. Heatingmay be accomplished by steam coils located in the base of the tank or by externalsteam heat exchanger through which the fuel oil is continually circulated.
Positive displacement pumps (usually rotary type) are used to deliver the fuel oil
from the tank, through the distribution system to the heater burners. These pumps arealways spared and the spare pump is driven by a steam turbine, while the operatingpump is motor driven. The fuel oil passes through a duplex ﬁlter before entering thesuction of the pumps. This ﬁlter is included to remove any solid contaminants thatmay be in the oil such as ﬁne coke particles which would foul the fuel oil burner.The discharge pressure of the pumps is controlled by a slipstream routed back to thestorage tanks through a pressure control valve. This valve is activated by a pressurecontrol element on the pump discharge header.Figure 13.28. A typical fuel oil system.574 CHAPTER 13
The pumps discharge the fuel oil via the pressure controller to a pre-heater. This
pre-heater may be a simple double pipe heat exchanger for relatively small units orregular shell and tube for the larger systems. Double pipe type exchangers are favoredin this service when economical because they are easier to clean and maintain. Thefuel oil leaves the pre-heater to enter the fuel oil distribution system at a temperaturehigh enough to maintain a viscosity low enough for the oil to ﬂow easily and to beeasily atomized by steam at the fuel oil “ gun” (or burner). All the piping associatedwith residual fuel systems are heavily insulated and steam traced. The distributionsystems of residual fuel oils is usually the re-circulating type. That is the fuel leavesthe pre-heater to circulate to all the user plants in a loop where the quantity used istaken off the stream and the remainder allowed to return to the system. The returnheader is routed back to the storage tanks. The circulation system handles between 1to 3 times that amount of oil that is actually burnt.
Fuel oils are introduced into the ﬁre box and ignited through a fuel oil burner some-
times called a fuel oil gun. In order to ensure combustion in a manner suitable fora ﬁre box operation the fuel oil needs to be dispersed into small droplets or spray atthe burner tip. In heavy residual oils this is almost always accomplished by steam.Compressed air is however sometimes used for this purpose. This atomizing streamis introduced into the gun chamber and comes into contact with the oil stream justbefore the burner tip. The kinetic energy in the atomizing medium forces the oil intosuitable droplets as it leaves the burner. Steam is normally used as the atomizingmaterial because it is usually cheaper, more readily available, and has a more reliablesource than air from a compressor.
The steam pressure for atomizing should be 15–25 psig higher than the fuel oil
pressure. The quantity of steam will range from 1.5 to 5 lbs per gallon of oil. Drysteam with a superheat of about 50
◦F is preferred for atomizing. In order to con-
trol the process heater operation oil burners require a turndown ability. That is theyrequire to operate satisfactory over a prescribed range of ﬂow. In keeping with anoperating range for oil ﬂow the atomizing medium must also have a similar oper-ating range. Burner pressure is a critical requirement for turndown. The steam (orair) pressure should be 15 psi or 10% (whichever is the greater) higher than oil pres-sure. The fuel oil supply system should be 100 psi higher than the burner require-ment.
The oil burner operation as with the fuel gas burner is controlled by the heater’ s process
stream outlet temperature. The temperature control valve activated by the coil outlet"
"temperature increases or decreases the oil ﬂow from the circulating oil stream to theburner. A proportional control valve on the atomizing steam line regulates the ﬂow ofsteam to the burner in keeping with the oil ﬂow. Figure 13.29 shows a typical burnercontrol system.SUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 575
There are various methods for safety shutdown. The one shown here shuts down the
oil ﬂow on steam failure and on loss of the pilot burner. In some systems there is alsoan automatic change over to gas ﬁring on low oil pressure.
Water systems
The major water systems generated in most chemical plants are:
rCooling water
rTreated water for BFW
Potable water as raw water is usually drawn from municipal supply. Where water is
required for cleaning or drinking this potable water is used without further processing.
Cooling water
Figure 13.30 is a mechanical ﬂow sheet showing the arrangement around the base of
a cooling tower for the collection and supply of cooling water.
The cooling water system is a circulating one. That is there is a cold supply line with
an associated warmer return line from all its users. Figure 13.31 shows a section ofthis distribution system.
The water returned to the cooling tower by the return header enters the top of the
tower and ﬂows down across the tower internals counter current to an air ﬂow eitherinduced or forced by fans passing up through the tower. The water cooled by the airﬂow is collected in the cooling tower basin. Make up water (usually potable water)is added to the basin under level control. Vertical cooling water circulating waterpumps take suction from the cooling tower basin sump to deliver the water into theplant’ s distribution header. These pumps are usually high capacity with a moderatedifferential head. Because of the critical nature of the water supply the pumps areeach rated at around 60% of design capacity with two in operation and two on standby. A mixture of motor and steam turbine drivers are quite common.
The supply header pressure is kept at around 30 psig and, very often in large plants
covering long distances, booster stations are installed at predetermined locations tomaintain the supply header pressure. These booster stations consist of pump pitswith again high capacity vertical pumps rated smaller of course than the main supplypumps. The location of these booster stations is determined by a rigorous hydraulicanalysis of the distribution system which also determines the header pipeline sizes.The return ﬂow is collected from each user into the return header and ﬂows back tothe cooling tower under the users’outlet pressure.Figure 13.29. A burner control system.Figure 13.30. Mechanical ﬂow diagram of a water cooling system.578 CHAPTER 13

The water in the cooling tower basin and in the cooling tower itself requires some
treatment to prevent the build up of algae and other undesirable contaminants. Aseparate small treatment plant is used for mixing the inhibiting chemicals and injectingthem into the critical sections of the system.
Boiler feed water treating
All water contains impurities no matter from what source the water comes from. Ap-
pendix 13.2 gives a listing of the common impurities found in water for industrialuse. Normally, in a chemical plant, water with most of these impurities can be usedwithout treating of any kind. However when it comes to generating steam and par-ticularly high-pressure steam these impurities become problematic. To operate steamgenerators effectively and to avoid serious damage to the unit, these impurities eitherhave to be removed or be converted into compounds that can be tolerated in the sys-tem. Appendix 13.2 also provides a description of the effect of these impurities onsteam generators and gives the normal means of treating.
In general there are three types of soluble impurities naturally present in water and
which must be removed or converted in order to make the water suitable for boilerfeed purpose. These are:
rScale forming impurities. These are salts of calcium, magnesium, silica, manganese,
and iron
rCompounds that cause foaming. These are usually soluble sodium salts
rDissolved gases. These are usually oxygen and carbon dioxide. The soluble gases
must be removed to prevent corrosion
Solid build up in the boiler itself is removed or kept at a low level by blow down. Thisis the mechanism of draining a prescribed amount of the boiling water from the boilersteam drum at regular intervals. This amount is calculated from the analysis of thesolid content of the feed water and must equal the amount brought into the system bythe feed water. Figure 13.32 gives an example of boiler blow down.
The American Boiler Manufacturers Association (ABMA) have developed limits for
the control of various solids in BFW . These are given in Table 13.1.
Other considerations regarding the limits of solids in BFW are:"
"rSludge. This is a direct measurement of feed water hardness (calcium and magne-
sium salts) since virtually all hardness comes out of solution in a boiler.
rTotal dissolved solids. These consist of sodium salts, soluble silica, and any chemi-
cals added. Total solids do not contribute to scale formation, but excessive amounts
can cause foaming.580 CHAPTER 13
Figure 13.32. How blow down reduces the amount of solids build up.
rSilica. This may be the blow down controlling factor in pre-softened water con-
taining high silica. At elevated pressures high silica content can cause foaming and
carry over.
rIron. High concentration of iron in BFW can cause serious deposit problems. Where
concentration is particularly high blow down may be based on reducing this con-centration.
There are two types of BFW treatment in use. There are the external type of treatingand the internal processes. As the names suggest the external processes are those thattreat the water before it enters the boiler. The internal treatments are those in the form

of added chemicals that treat the water inside the boiler. Only the external processes
are described here.
The “hot lime” process
This is a water softening process which uses a hot lime contact to induce a precipitate
of the compounds contributing to the hardness. The sludge formed is allowed tosettle out. Very often coagulation chemicals such as alum or iron salts are used toenhance the settling and the removal of the sludge formed. In most plants that usethe “ lime” process the reaction by the addition of lime and soda ash is carried out atelevated temperatures. However the reaction can be allowed to take place at ambienttemperatures. The hardness of the water from the “ cold” process will be about 17–35ppm while that from the “ hot” process will be 8–17 ppm. Clean up ﬁlters containinganthracite are often used to ﬁnish the treating process.
The ion exchange processes
As the name implies this process exchanges undesirable ions contained in the raw
water with more desirable ones that produces acceptable BFW . For example, in thesoftening process, calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions. Indealkalization, the ions contributing to alkalinity (carbonates, bicarbonates, etc) areremoved and replaced with chloride ions. Demineralization in this process replacesall cations with hydrogen ions (H
+), and all anions with hydroxyl ions (OH−) making
pure water (H++OH−).
The ion exchange material needs to be regenerated after a period of operation. Theoperating period will differ from process to process and will depend to some extenton the amount of impurities in the water and the required purity of the treated water.Regeneration is accomplished in three steps:
rBack washing
rRegenerating the resin bed with regenerating chemicals
rRinsing
Figure 13.33 shows the internals of a typical ion exchange unit.
Under operating conditions the raw water is introduced through the top connection
and distributor. The water ﬂows through the resin bed where ion exchange takesplace. The treated water is removed via the bottom connection. Under regenerationoperation, raw water as backwash is introduced through the bottom connection andremoved from the top connection. During its passage upward through the resin andsupport beds it “ ﬂuffs”the beds and removes any waste material that has adheredto them. The backwash water is then sent to the plants waste water disposal system.582 CHAPTER 13
Figure 13.33. A typical ion exchange unit.
Regenerating exchange chemical is introduced directly above the resin bed through a
chemical distributor and allowed to ﬂow downward to be removed at the bottom wateroutlet. The regenerating cycle is completed with the rinsing of the bed to remove anysurplus regenerating chemicals. This is done by introducing a stream of raw water atthe top connection and removing it from the bottom connection. This water is alsodisposed to waste.
Normally ion exchange units are installed in pairs. When one is operating the other is
being regenerated. An automatic switch over of electronically controlled valves takesthe pair of units through the correct cycles at the prescribed time intervals, withoutdisrupting the treating process. Figure 13.34 shows a typical “ hook up”of an ionexchange unit.
Deaeration
The deaeration process is used in almost all BFW treatment to remove dissolved
gases from the water. Normally treated water and returned condensate are routed toa deaerator immediately prior to entering the boiler steam drum. Figure 13.35 is adrawing of a typical deaerator drum layout."
"The drum consists of a retention vessel surmounted by a degassing tower section.
The degassing section contains a packed volume over which the treated water (andcondensate) stream is passed. Low-pressure steam, usually let down saturated 50 psigsteam or, if available 5 psig steam from condensate ﬂash is introduced to the bottomof the degassing section. The steam ﬂows upward through the packed section andFigure 13.34. An ion exchange unit hook up.584 CHAPTER 13

counter current to the water. This action removes the dissolved gasses from the water.
These gasses then leave with the steam from the top of the degassing section to bevented to atmosphere. The gas free water free ﬂows into the main retaining sectionof the deaerator.
The treated water feed is introduced to the degassing section of the deaerator through
atomizing spray/distributor. This reduces the water stream to ﬁne droplets prior toentering the packed section. This enhances the removal of the gasses in the water.deaerators operate at about 2–3 psig and at this pressure all of the CO
2contained in
the water and most of the oxygen is removed.
The BFW pumps draw suction directly from the deaerator. To ensure that there is
available sufﬁcient NPSH for the pumps to operate properly deaerator drums areinstalled on a structure at least 15 ft above the center line of the pump suction.Most large pumps (as BFW pumps are) usually require a relatively high NPSH whenhandling hot water.
The retention section of the deaerator should have as a minimum 30 minutes of surge
between HLL and LLL. The water feed to the deaerator is normally on retentionSUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 585
section level control. The boiler feed from the BFW pumps will be on ﬂow control
with steam drum level reset. Very often boiler feed ﬂow has low ﬂow alarm and atvery low ﬂow has automatic boiler shut down device.
Compressed air system
All oil reﬁning plants require a supply of compressed air to operate the plant and for
plant maintenance. There are usually two separate systems and these are:
rPlant air system
rInstrument air system
Plant air is generally supplied by a simple compressor with an after cooler. Very oftenwhen plant air is required only for maintenance this is furnished by a mobile compres-sor connected to a distribution piping system. Air for catalyst regeneration and the likeis normally supplied by the regular process gas compressor on the unit. Instrument airshould always be a separate supply system. Compressed air for instrument operationmust be free of oil and dry for the proper function of the instruments it supplies. Thisis a requirement which is not necessary for most plant air usage. A reliable sourceof clean dry instrument air is an essential requirement for plant operation. Failure ofthis system means a complete shut down of the plant.
Figure 13.36 shows a typical instrument air supply system.Atmospheric air is introduced into the suction of one of two compressors via an
air ﬁlter. The compressors are usually reciprocating or screw type non-lubricating.Centrifugal type compressors have been used for this service when the demand forinstrument air is very high. The air compressors discharge the air at the requiredpressure (usually above 45 psig) into an air cooler before the air enters one of twodryers. One of the compressors is in operation while the other is on standby. Theoperating compressor is usually motor driven with a discharge pressure operatedon/off start up switch. The standby compressor is turbine (or diesel engine) drivenwith an automatic start up on low discharge pressure switch.
The cooled compressed air leaves the cooler to enter the dryers. There are two dryer
vessels each containing a bed of desiccant material. This material is either silicagel (the most common), alumina, or in special cases zeolite (molecular sieve). Oneof the two dryers is in operation with the compressed air ﬂowing through it to bedried and to enter the instrument air receiver. The desiccant in the other dryer isbeing simultaneously regenerated. Regeneration of the desiccant bed is effected bypassing through the bed a stream of heated air and venting the stream to atmo-sphere. This heated stream removes the water from the desiccant to restore its hy-groscopic properties. At the end of this heating cycle cooled air is reintroduced tocool down the bed to its operating temperature. When cool the unit is ready to beFigure 13.36. An instrument air supply system.SUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 587
switched into operation for the ﬁrst dryer to start its regeneration cycle. The various
operating and regeneration phases are automatically obtained by a series of solenoidvalves operated by a sequence timer switch control. These dryers (often including thecompressor and receiver items) are packaged units supplied, skid mounted, and readyfor operation.
The instrument air receiver vessel is a pressure vessel containing a crinkled wire mesh"
"screen (CWMS) before the outlet nozzle. It is high-pressure protected by a pressurecontrol valve venting to atmosphere, and of course is also protected by a pressuresafety relief valve (not shown in diagram). The air leaves the top of this vessel toenter the instrument air distribution system servicing all the plants in the complex.
13.3 Safety systems
A major requirement in the design and engineering of a plant or system is to ensure its
safe operation. Much of the effort in this respect is directed to determining the pressurelimits of equipment and to protect that equipment from dangerous over pressuring.Pressure relief valves are normally used for this protection service, although undercertain conditions bursting discs may be used. This section of Chapter 13 covers thevarious types of relief valves, and the procedure for calculating the correct oriﬁce sizeof the valve and the valve selection.
Determination of risk
The cost of providing facilities to relieve all possible emergencies simultaneously is
prohibitive. Every emergency arises from a speciﬁc cause, the simultaneous occur-rence of two or more emergencies or contingencies is unlikely. Hence, an emergencywhich can arise from two or more contingencies (e.g., the simultaneous failure ofa control valve and cooling water) is not considered when sizing safety equipment.Likewise, simultaneous but separate emergencies are not considered.
Every unit or piece of equipment must be studied individually and every contingency
must be evaluated. The safety equipment for an individual unit is sized to handle thelargest load resulting from any possible single contingency. If a certain emergencywould involve more than one unit, then all must be considered as an entity. Theequipment judged to be involved in any one emergency is termed “ single risk” . Thesingle risk which results in the largest load on the safety facilities in any system istermed “ largest single risk” and forms the design basis for the equipment.
Note: The emergency which results in the largest single risk on the overall basis may
be different from the emergency(ies) which form the basis for individual pieces of
equipment.588 CHAPTER 13
Contingencies generally fall into one of two categories— ﬁre (external) or operating
failure. Operating failure covers such contingencies as utility failure, mechanicalfailure, or mal-operation.
Deﬁnitions
The terms used and the descriptions given in this item are based on data given in two
API publications. These are: API RP520 and 521. References are also made to: Part 1ANSI Proposed Standard, “ Terminology for Pressure Relief Devices” and to ASMEPTC 25.2. These publications are the safety standards commonly in current use. Thefollowing deﬁnition of terms used in the design of safety systems helps to understandthe design and criteria of safety systems.
Accumulation
Accumulation is the pressure increase over the maximum allowable working pressure
of the vessel during discharge through the pressure relief valve expressed as a percentof that pressure, or in PSI.
Atmospheric discharge
Atmospheric discharge is the release of vapors and gases from pressure relief and
de-pressurizing devices to the atmosphere.
Back pressure
Back pressure is the pressure existing at the outlet of the pressure relief device due to
pressure in the discharge system.
Balanced safety relief valves
A balanced safety relief valve incorporates means for minimizing the effect of back
pressure on the performance characteristics-opening pressure, closing pressure, lift,and relieving capacity.
Blow-down
Blow-down is the difference between the set pressure and the resealing pressure of a
pressure relief valve, expressed as a percent of the set pressure, or in PSI.SUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 589
Burst pressure
Burst pressure is the value of inlet static pressure at which a rupture disk device
functions.
Conventional safety relief valve
A conventional safety relief valve is a closed bonnet pressure relief valve that has the
bonnet vented to the discharge side of the valve. The performance characteristics-opening pressure, closing pressure, lift, and relieving capacity are directly affectedby changes of the back pressure on the valve.
Design pressure
Design pressure is the pressure used in the design of a vessel to determine the minimum
permissible thickness or physical characteristics of the different parts of a vessel.
Flare
A ﬂare is a means for safe disposal of waste gases by combustion. With an elevated
ﬂare the combustion is carried out at the top of a pipe or stack where the burner and
igniter are located. A ground ﬂare is similarly equipped except that combustion is
carried out at or near ground level. A burn pit differs from a ﬂare in that it is normally
designed to handle both liquids and vapors. Flare systems are described and discussed
more fully in “ Offsite Systems” of this chapter.
Lift
Lift is the actual travel of the disk away from closed position when the valve is"
"relieving.
Overpressure
Overpressure is the pressure increase over the set pressure of the primary relieving
device; it would be termed accumulation when the relieving device is set at the
maximum allowable working pressure of the vessel.
Note: When the set pressure of the ﬁrst (primary) pressure relief valve to open is less
than the maximum allowable working pressure of the vessel, the overpressure may be
greater than 10% of the set pressure of the valve.590 CHAPTER 13
Pilot-operated pressure relief valve
A pilot-operated pressure-relief valve is one that has the major ﬂow device combined
with and controlled by a self-actuated auxiliary pressure relief valve. This type valvedoes not utilize an external source of energy.
Pressure relief valvePressure relief valve is a generic term applied to relief valves, safety valves, or safety
relief valves.
Relieving conditionsRelieving conditions pertain to pressure relief device inlet pressure and temperature
at a speciﬁc overpressure. The relieving pressure is equal to the valve set pressure(or rupture disk burst pressure) plus the overpressure. The temperature of the ﬂowingﬂuid at relieving conditions may be higher or lower than the operating temperature.
Set pressureSet pressure in psig is the inlet pressure at which the pressure relief valve is adjusted
to open under service conditions. In a safety or safety relief valve in gas, vapor, orsteam service, the set pressure is the inlet pressure at which the valve pops underservice conditions. In a relief or safety relief valve in liquid service, the set pressureis the inlet pressure at which the valve starts to discharge under service conditions.
Superimposed back pressureSuperimposed back pressure is static pressure existing at the outlet of a pressure relief
device at the time the device is required to operate. It is the result of pressure in thedischarge system from other sources. This type of back pressure may be constant orvariable; it may govern whether a conventional or balanced-type pressure relief valveshould be used in speciﬁc applications.
V apor depressing systemA vapor depressing system is a protective arrangement of valves and piping intended
to provide for rapid reduction of pressure in equipment by release of vapors. Actuationof the system may be automatic or manual.
V ent stackA vent stack is the elevated vertical termination of a disposal system which discharges
vapors into the atmosphere without combustion or conversion of the relieved ﬂuid.SUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 591
Types of pressure relief valves
The following is a list of those types of relief valves commonly used in industry. These
have been approved according to ASME V111 “ Boiler and Pressure Vessel” code.
Conventional safety relief valves
In a conventional safety relief valve the inlet pressure to the valve is directly opposed
by a spring closing the valve, the back pressure on the outlet of the valve changes theinlet pressure at which the valve will open. A diagram of a conventional relief valveis shown below as Figure 13.37.
Balanced safety relief valves
Balanced safety valves are those in which the back pressure has very little or no
inﬂuence on the set pressure. The most widely used means of balancing a safety relief
Figure 13.37. A diagram of a conventional safety relief valve.592 CHAPTER 13
Figure 13.38. A diagram of a balanced safety relief valve.
valve is through the use of a bellows. In the balanced bellows valve, the effective area
of the bellows is the same as the nozzle seat area and back pressure is prevented fromacting on the top side of the disk. Thus the valve opens at the same inlet pressureeven though the back pressure may vary. A diagram of a balanced safety relief valveis shown as Figure 13.38.
Pilot operated safety relief valves
A pilot-operated safety relief valve is a device consisting of two principal parts,
a main valve and a pilot. Inlet pressure is directed to the top of the main valvepiston, and with more area exposed to pressure on the top of the piston than on thebottom; pressure, not a spring, holds the main valve closed. At the set pressure theSUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 593
pilot opens reducing the pressure on top of the piston and the main valve goes fully
open.
Resilient seated safety relief valves
When metal-to-metal seated conventional or bellows type safety relief valves are
used where the operating pressure is close to the set pressure, some leakage can beexpected through the seats of the valve (Refer to API Standard 527, “ CommercialSeat Tightness of Safety Relief Valves with Metal-to-Metal Seats” ).
Resilient seated safety relief valves with either O-Ring seat seal or plastic seat such as
Teﬂon provide seat tightness. Limitations of temperature and chemical compatibilityof the resilient material must be considered when using these valves.
Rupture disk
A rupture disk consists of a thin metal diaphragm held between ﬂanges. The disk"
"is designed to rupture and relieve pressure within tolerances established by ASMECode.
Capacity
The maximum amount of material to be released during the largest single risk emer-
gency determines the size of the safety relief valves in any given system. Any calcu-lation to determine valve sizing must therefore be preceded by a calculation or somedetermination of the maximum amount. Among the most common sizing criteria isthe event of ﬁre and its effect on the contents of exposed vessels. There are also othercriteria which can determine maximum release that are attributable to operationalfailure.
Capacity due to ﬁre
The exact method of making this calculation must be established from the appropriate
codes which apply, API RP-520, Part I, API Standard 2510, NFPA No. 58, or localcodes which may apply. Each of the listed codes or standards approach the problemin a slightly different manner.
Liquid systems— A majority of the systems that are encountered will contain liquids
or liquids in equilibrium with vapor. Fire relief capacity in this situation is calculatedon the basis of heat energy from the ﬁre translated in terms of vapor generated in theboiling liquid.594 CHAPTER 13
Figure 13.39. Insulation factors.
API RP-520, Part I, applies to reﬁneries and process plants. It expresses requirements
in terms of heat input.
Q=21000 FA0.82
where
Q=Btu/hr heat input
A=area in sqft of wetted surface of the vessel up to 25 ft above grade.Wetted surface is calculated at the maximum ﬁll level. Grade is the groundlevel under the vessel.
F=ﬁreproof factor due to insulation becoming 1.0 for a bare vessel (see Figure13.39).
The amount of vapor generated with this is then calculated from the latent heat of thematerial at the relieving pressure of the valve by the following equation. For ﬁre reliefonly this may be calculated at 120% of maximum allowable working pressure. AllSUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 595
other conditions must be calculated at 110% of maximum allowable working pressure
thus:
Q/Ht=W
where
Q=Btu/hr heat input to the vessel
HL=Btu/lb latent heat of the material being relieved
W=lb/hr of vapor to be relieved by the relief valve
The latent heat of pure and some mixed parafﬁn hydrocarbons materials may beestimated using the data given in API RP-520. A more accurate latent heat evaluationfor mixed hydrocarbons will be found by utilizing vapor-liquid equilibrium K data andmaking a ﬂash calculation. Mixed hydrocarbons will fractionate, beginning with thelowest temperature boiling mixture and progress to the highest temperature mixture;therefore, consideration must be given to the condition which will cause the largestvapor generation requirements from the heat input of a ﬁre.
Latent heat will approach a minimum value near critical conditions; however, the
effect does not go to zero. An arbitrary minimum value that may be used is 50 Btu/lb.
Sizing of required oriﬁce areas
The safety relief valve manufacturers have standard oriﬁce designation for area and
the valve body sizes which contain these oriﬁces (API Standard 526, “ Flanged SteelSafety Relief Valves for Use in Petroleum Reﬁneries” ). The standard oriﬁces available,by letter designation and area are:
D Oriﬁce 0.110 inch

P Oriﬁce 6.38 inch2
Q Oriﬁce 11.05 inch2
R Oriﬁce 16.0 inch2
T Oriﬁce 26.0 inch2
Note: however, many small safety relief valves are manufactured with oriﬁce areas
smaller than “ D” , and many pilot-operated types contain oriﬁce areas larger than “ T” .596 CHAPTER 13

Sizing for ﬂashing liquids
The conventional method is to determine the percent ﬂashing from a Mollier diagram
or from the enthalpy values. Then consider the liquid portion and vapor portionseparately as in mixed phase ﬂow. A method to calculate the percent ﬂashing isshown in the following equation:
% Flash =h
f(1)−hf(2)
hfg(2)×100
where
hf(1)=enthalpy in Btu/lb of saturated liquid at upstream temperature
hr(2)=enthalpy in Btu/lb of saturated liquid at downstream pressure
hfg(2)=enthalpy of evaporation in Btu/lb at downstream pressure

T=temperature of gas in◦R(◦F+460)
S=mol weight of gas divided by 29
µ2=compressibility factor at downstream conditions
The following are some special considerations that may have to be made in determin-
ing.
Process C Vvalues
Pressure drop
For compressible ﬂuids the maximum usable pressure drop in equations (b) and (c)is the critical value. As a rule of thumb and for design purposes this value is 50% ofthe absolute upstream pressure. (The valve can take more than the critical pressuredrop, but any pressure drop over the critical takes the form of exit losses).
Flashing liquids
In the absence of accurate information, it is recommended that for ﬂashing servicethe valve body be speciﬁed as one nominal size larger than the valve port.
Two-phase ﬂow
If two-phase ﬂow exists upstream of the control valve experience has shown that forﬂuids below their critical point a sufﬁciently accurate process C
Vvalue can be arrived
at by adding the process CVvalues for the gas and liquid portions of the stream.
The calculation is based on the quantities of gas and liquid at upstream conditions.The valve body is speciﬁed to be one nominal size larger than the port to allow forexpansion.
V alve rangeability
The rangeability of a control valve is the ratio of the ﬂow coefﬁcient at the maximumﬂow rate to the ﬂow coefﬁcient at the minimum ﬂow rate. ( R=C
VMax/ CVMin).
Valve rangeability is actually a criteria which is used to judge whether a given valvewill be in a controlling position throughout its required range of operation (neitherwide open nor fully closed). In practice the selection of the actual valve to be installedis the responsibility of the instrument engineer. As the process engineer is usually theperson responsible for the correct operation of the process itself however he must besatisﬁed that the item selected meets the control criteria required. He must thereforesatisfy himself that the valve will control over the range of the process ﬂow.
Control valves are usually limited to a rangeability of 10 : 1. If Ris greater than 10 : 1
then a dual valve installation should be considered in order to assure good control at
the maximum and minimum ﬂow conditions.SUPPORT SYSTEMS COMMON TO MOST REFINERIES 609
In some applications, particularly on compressor or blower suction, butterﬂy valves
have been speciﬁed to be line size without considering that as a result the valve mayoperate almost closed for long periods of time. Under this condition there have beencases of erosion resulting from this. It is recommended therefore that butterﬂy valvesbe sized so that they will not operate below 10% open for any appreciable period oftime and not arbitrarily be made line size.
V alve ﬂow coefﬁcient (C
V/prime)
In order to ensure that the valve is in a controlling position at the maximum ﬂow rate,
the valve CV/primeis the maximum process CVvalue determined above, divided by 0.8.
The reasons for using this factor are that:
(1) It is not desirable to have the valve fully open at maximum ﬂow since it is not
then in a controlling position.
(2) The valves supplied by a single manufacturer often vary as much as 10–20% in
CV.
(3) Allowance must be made for pressure drop, ﬂow rate, etc., values which differ
from design.
Control valve sizing
Control valve sizes are determined by the manufacturers from the process data sub-mitted to them. However there are available some simple equations to give a goodestimate of the required valve sizes to meet a process duty. Three of these are givenbelow:
S(inches) =/bracketleftbiggValve C
V
9/bracketrightbigg1/2
Double seated control valves sizes may be estimated by:
S(inches) =/bracketleftbiggValve CV
12/bracketrightbigg1/2
Butterﬂy valve sizes may be estimated by:
S(inches) =/bracketleftbiggValve CV
20/bracketrightbigg1/2"
"The constants (9, 12 or 20) in these equations can vary as much as 25% dependingon the valve manufacturer.
A control valve should be no larger than the line size. A control valve size that is
calculated to be greater than line size should be carefully checked together with thecalculation used for determining line size. Ideally a control valve size should be onesize smaller than line size.610 CHAPTER 13
Once the valve size is estimated and the valve CVknown, then the percent opening
of the valve at minimum ﬂow and maximum ﬂow can be obtained by dividing the
respective process CVvalues conditions by the valve CV. This information is normally
required to check the percent opening of a butterﬂy at minimum ﬂow. It is not normallynecessary to calculate it for any other type of valve.
V alve action on air failureIn the analysis of the design and operation of any process or utility system the question
always arises on the action of control valves in the system on instrument air failure.Should the control valve fail open or closed is the judgement decision of the processengineer after evaluating all aspects of safety and damage in each event. For example,control valves on ﬁred heater tube inlets should always fail open to prevent damage tothe tubes through low or no ﬂow through them when they are hot. On the other handcontrol valves controlling fuel to the heaters should fail closed on air failure to avoidover heating of the heater during the air failure.
The failed action of the valve is established by introducing the motive air to either
above the diaphragm for a failed open requirement or below the diaphragm for a failedshut situation. The air failure to the valve above the diaphragm allows the spring topull up the plugs from the valve seats. Air failure to valves below the diaphragmforces the spring to seat the valves in the closed position.Chapter 14

Introduction
Certainly during the last three decades of the 1900s control of contaminants from
the reﬁning of crude oil has become a signiﬁcant consideration in the design andoperation of the oil reﬁnery. Chapter 2 of this book provides the changes that havetaken place in the speciﬁcation of motive fuels to meet legislative environmentalcontrol. These products have been singled out because they impact more promi-nently on the daily life style and health of the general public, particularly in themore advanced industrial countries. Similar changes and legislative control havebeen adopted on the levels of efﬂuents leaving the reﬁnery plants in the water andair. These changes have become more restrictive as greater knowledge of their ef-fect on the environment emerges. This chapter then deals with some of the measuresadopted in process design and operation of processes to meet these environmentalprotection measures. These are described and discussed in the following parts of thechapter:
Part 1. Aqueous wastes
Part 2. Emission to the atmospherePart 3. Noise abatement
The aqueous and atmospheric contaminants that most reﬁneries emit are shown in
Table 14.1. The table also shows the process plant source of these more commoncontaminants.
14.1 Aqueous wastes
This part is divided into a description of the pollutants in aqueous wastes, the pro-
cesses that generate the wastes, and the treatment of the various aqueous wastestreams.

Pollutants in aqueous waste streams
The most undesirable pollutants in aqueous waste streams are:
rThose that deplete the dissolved oxygen content of the waterways into which they
discharge
rThose contaminants that are toxic to all forms of life, such as arsenic, cyanide,mercury and the like
rThose contaminants that impart undesirable tastes and odors to streams and otherwaterways into which they discharge
A description and discussion on these contaminants are expressed in the followingparagraphs.
The effect of contaminants on the oxygen balance of natural waterways
Natural waterways have a complex and delicate oxygen balance. The water contains"
"an amount of dissolved oxygen which has an equilibrium of between 14 ppm in winterTHE REFINER Y ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 613
and 7 ppm in summer. Aquatic life (ﬁsh and tadpoles) continually consume oxygen
from the water, but aquatic plants produce oxygen naturally maintaining the balancerequired to sustain ﬁsh life. Any oxidizable contaminant introduced into the naturalwaterways consumes the dissolved oxygen to be oxidized. The dissolved oxygen willbe depleted below saturation point and will be replenished only by re-aeration. Therelative rate of replenishment to its saturation level will depend on a time factorequivalent to the stream distance or the stream ﬂow rate.
Oxygen depletion occurs by the introduction of one or more of the following contam-
inants entering the waterway:
rNatural pollution by surface run-off rainwater, or melting snow, in the form ofsoluble salts leached from the earth
rNatural pollution caused by decay of organic plants from swamps or other sources
rHuman and animal life excretion
rChemical pollution from reducing agents in industrial plant wastes. Such as sulﬁdes,nitrites, ferrous salts, etc.
rBiochemical pollution from such industrial wastes as phenols, hydrocarbons, car-bohydrates, and the like
The degree of oxygen depletion from the pollution sources described above may becatalogued by the following terms:
BOD— Biological Oxygen Demand.
COD— Chemical Oxygen Demand.IOD— Immediate Oxygen Demand.
BOD. Since all natural waterways will contain bacteria and nutrient, almost any waste
compound introduced into the waterway will initiate biochemical reactions. These
reactions will consume some of the dissolved oxygen in the water. This is illustratedin Figure 14.1.
The depletion of oxygen due to biological pollution is not very rapid. It follows the
laws of ﬁrst order reaction. Because of this the effect of BOD is measured in thelaboratory on a ﬁve day basis, and has been universally adopted as the measure ofpollution effect. The “ Ultimate” BOD is a measure of the total oxygen consumed whenthe biological reaction proceeds to almost completion. The “ 5 day” BOD is believedto be approximately the Ultimate. Figure 14.2 shows the “ 5 day”BOD versus the“ Ultimate” .
In summary BOD measures organic wastes that are biologically oxidizable.COD. The COD is a measure of the oxygen depletion due to organic and inor-
ganic wastes which are chemically oxidizable. There are several laboratory methods614 CHAPTER 14

accepted to measure the oxygen depletion effect of these pollution. The two most
widely accepted are the “ 4 hour permanganate” method or the “ 2 hour dichromate”
method. Although there is no generalized correlation between BOD and COD, usuallythe COD will be larger than the BOD. The following table illustrates how differentwastes exhibit a different relationship between COD and BOD (Table 14.2).
IOD. Oxygen consumption by reducing chemicals such as sulﬁdes and nitrates is
typiﬁed as follows:
S
2−+2O2−→ SO2−
4
NO−2+1/2O2−→ NO−3
These types of inorganic oxidation reactions are very rapid and create what is measured
in the laboratory as immediate oxygen demand. If waste contaminants contain theseinorganic oxidizers the “ 5 day” BOD test will include the consumption of the oxygendue to IOD also. A separate test to determine IOD must be made and this resultsubtracted from the “ 5 day” BOD to arrive at the true BOD result.
Toxic pollutants common to oil reﬁning
Toxic pollutants that are most commonly contained in untreated reﬁnery aqueous
wastes are:
Oil. Heavy oil and other hydrocarbons are the most problematic pollution to be found
in reﬁnery water efﬂuent. All reﬁneries exercise the most stringent methods to control
and remove these undesirable pollutants. Indeed in many cases the treated efﬂuent616 CHAPTER 14
streams leaving the reﬁnery may well be purer than incoming portable water used in
the processes.
Phenols. These chemicals often formed in reﬁnery processes such as catalytic and
thermal crackers, are highly toxic to aquatic life in concentrations of 1 to 10 ppm."
"Apart from their toxicity phenols also unpleasant taste and odor to drinking water inthe range of 50 to 100 ppb. In concentrations of 200 ppm and more, these chemicalscan also deactivate water treatment plants such as trickle ﬁlters and activated sludgeunits.
Caustic soda and derivatives. Solutions containing sodium hydroxide are used in a
number of reﬁnery processes. Inevitably some of this chemical enters the reﬁnery’ s
waste water system. This contaminant is toxic to humans and marine life in even lowconcentrations. The spent caustic (compounds leaving the process) such as sodiumsulﬁde is even more injurious.
Aqueous solutions of ammonium salts. The most common of these are ammonium
sulﬁde NH
4SH, and ammonium chloride. Both these salts are present in efﬂuent
water from the crude distillation unit overhead accumulator, however the sulﬁde
salt is present in all aqueous efﬂuents from the cracking processes, and the hydrotreaters. Other ammonium salts are also present in hydro cracking and deep oil hydrotreating.
Acids in aqueous efﬂuents. The most common of these are from the alkylation pro-
cesses which use either hydroﬂuoric acid or sulfuric acid. In some isomerization
processes hydrochloric acid is used to promote the aluminum chloride catalyst. Insome older processes sulfur dioxide is used to remove aromatics. This efﬂuent usu-ally leaves these plants as dilute sulfuric acid.
Ketones, furfural, and urea. These compounds are used in the reﬁning of lube
oils. MEK and Urea are used in the dewaxing processes while furfural is used in
the extraction processes for ﬁnished lube oil stock. All of these compounds aretoxic.
Treating reﬁnery aqueous wastes
The treatment of aqueous wastes from oil reﬁneries fall into three categories. These
are:

rSecondary treatment, which includes chemical coagulation, activated sludge pro-
cesses, trickle ﬁlters, air ﬂotation and aerators
Most energy reﬁneries contain only the ﬁrst two of the above categories.
Sour water strippers. This is one of the most common treating process. Its purpose is
to remove the pollutant gases included in process plant efﬂuents. The more common
pollutants are ammonia, ammonium salts, and hydrogen sulﬁde. The sour water strip-per is almost always located in the process area of the reﬁnery. The feed to the stripperis the efﬂuent water from the crude unit overhead condenser, the water phase fromthe desalter, the condensed water from the vacuum unit’ s hot well, and all the watercondensate from the hydro-treater product steam strippers. The sour water stripper isusually a single trayed tower with no reﬂux or a similar tower with an overhead reﬂuxstream. Figure 14.3 shows a simple stripper tower with no reﬂux and Figure 14.4shows a stripper with an overhead condenser and reﬂux.618 CHAPTER 14

Both these type of sour water stripping lend themselves to tray by tray mass and heat
transfer. The sour water feed is introduced on the top tray of the tower while steamusually at a rates of 0.5–1.5 lbs/gallon of feed is introduced below the bottom tray. Inthe case of a tower with reﬂux the reﬂux enters the tower with the fresh feed. The designof both towers utilize the partial pressure relationship of NH
3and H 2S in aqueous
solution. A series of graphs giving these relationships are given in Appendix 14.1of this chapter as Figures 14.A.1–14.A.10. An example of the design for a sour waterstripper with no reﬂux is given in Appendix 14.2.
Spent caustic disposal. The other major efﬂuent from oil reﬁning is the spent caustic
streams from hydrogen sulﬁde removal and also the removal of phenols. Reﬁners usu-
ally have the following options in the disposal of these streams. In order of preferencethese can be listed as follows:THE REFINER Y ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 619

Both the phenolic and sulﬁdic spent caustic have a commercial value in industrial
areas and where transportation costs make sales an attractive economic option. In thecase of the phenolic spent caustic, processors recover, separate, and purify variouscresylic acid fractions for commercial use and sales. In the case of the sulﬁdic spentcaustic this can be sold as sodium sulﬁde with some additional processing.
Neutralizing phenolic spent caustic. As listed above phenolic spent caustic can be"
"neutralized using acid or ﬂue gas. When neutralized the mixture separates into two
liquid phases. The upper phase contains the acid oils while the lower phase is anaqueous solution of sodium sulfate or sodium carbonate. The neutralization usingeither acid or ﬂue gas can be accomplished in a batch or continuous operation. Batchneutralization using acid is considered to be the preferable route in this case. Fluegas neutralization, although practical and commercially used in many installations ismore complex in design than the acid application and does not lend itself readily tobatch operation. It may require in some instances large pipe-work, switch valves, andab l o w e r .
A diagram of a phenolic caustic batch neutralizer is shown in Figure 14.5.The process is fairly simple involving the following steps:
1. Charging the spent caustic batch into the neutralizer vessel.
2. The addition and thorough mixing of the acid neutralizer into the batch. This has
to be accomplished slowly and carefully to avoid lowering the pH of the batch toofar. A pH of between 4 and 5 will be required to free the phenols completely.
3. A settling period is necessary to allow the sprung acids to separate from the sprung
water.
4. This step is the pumping out and disposal of the sprung water.Figure 14.5. Batch neutralization of spent caustic with acid.THE REFINER Y ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 621
5. The sprung acid is steam stripped to remove any residual H 2S and light mercaptans.
6. Pump out the interface material which will be included in the next spent caustic
batch.
7. Finally pumping out of the sprung acid.
The neutralization step is exothermic giving out around 125 Btu/lb of sprung acid.
As the objective of the process is to produce a phenol-free sprung water for disposalthe system temperature should be kept as low as possible until the sprung water isremoved. For example the solubility of phenol in pure water at 120
◦F is about 11%wt
while its solubility at 100◦F is 8.5 wt%. For this reason therefore steam stripping
should not begin until the sprung water has been removed. Routing the sprung waterto the sour water stripper ensures the removal of any entrained H
2S in that stream.
Mixing of the acid/spent caustic is usually achieved using a mixing valve at the inletof the neutralizer. An educator or a jet nozzle inlet to the vessel itself would ensurecomplete mixing if this is required.
Spent caustic oxidation
Spent caustic cannot be steam stripped to remove the sulﬁdes contained in it due
to the H
2S removal process in which the caustic was used. This is because sodium
sulﬁde does not hydrolyze even when heated. Acids could be used, of course, toneutralize the spent caustic which would release gaseous H
2S. This would however
be a costly procedure and causes a potential air pollution problem. The alkaline sulﬁdecan be economically oxidized to form thiosulfates and sulfates. This is the processmost commonly used in reﬁneries where only sulﬁdes are the pollutants in the spentcaustic and the release of gaseous H
2S is a problem. The oxidation process also applies
to the presence of ammonia sulﬁde in the stream. The process has not been applied towastes containing a higher percentage of phenols, because the phenols interfere withthe oxidation process.
Oxidation of sulﬁdes to thiosulfates
The oxidation of Na
2S or (NH 4)2S to the corresponding thiosulfates may be expressed
in ionic terms as follows:
2S2−+2O2+H2O→ S2O2−
3+2OH−

Similarly the oxidation of NaSH or NH 4SH to the corresponding thiosulfate can be
expressed as follows:

"Figure 14.6 shows a typical oxidizing unit. Brieﬂy the unit consists of an oxidizingtower, and an overhead separator. The sour water feed enters the oxidizing tower afterpreheating by exchange with the hot oxidizer overhead efﬂuent. Heating steam and airis injected into the sour water feed stream before entering the oxidizer tower. The steamﬂow is controlled by the temperature of the inlet mixture while the air is ﬂow controlledto meet the reactor condition premise. The oxidizing tower itself is divided into threesections with mixing nozzles connecting the inlet to each section. The reactants (airand the sour water feed ) enter the base of the oxidizer also through a mixing nozzleand ﬂow upwards through the sections of the tower. The oxidized efﬂuent leaves thetop of the tower to be cooled and partially condensed by exchange with the sour waterfeed. The cooled efﬂuent enters a separator operating under pressure control.

gases leave through this controller to ﬂare or other suitable disposal equipment (such
as a heaters ﬁrebox). The oil phase of the efﬂuent is skimmed off as a side streamwhile the water phase after settling leaves the bottom of the separator as the oxidizedefﬂuent.
High temperature and low pressures tend to vaporize some of the water in the top
section of the oxidizer. This results in more sulﬁdes being stripped out into the vaporphase. Thus it is recommended that the oxidizer top pressure be at least 25–40 psiabove the vapor pressure of the water at the oxidizer top temperature. Typical designcriteria for these oxidizing units are given in Table 14.3.
Oxidation of mercaptans
If caustic soda has been used to remove H
2S there will almost certainly be mercaptans
present in the sour stream. Caustic soda will also react with and remove these from
the process stream. Certainly in treating these light streams from sour crudes themercaptan content of the spent caustic stream could be as high as 3,000 ppm ofsodium mercaptide sulﬁde. The greater part of the mercaptides will be oxidized tohydrocarbon disulﬁdes according to the equation:
2RSNa +
1/2O2+H2O−→ RSSR +2NaOH.
Almost all the mercaptides will be oxidized in a concurrent ﬂow reactor. Howeversome of the mercaptides will be partially hydrolyzed and it can be assumed thatthere will be a certain amount of free mercaptans present in accordance with theequilibrium:
RSNa +H
2O←→ RSH+NaOH.
The free mercaptan formed by this reaction will be stripped out of solution and leavethe reactor in the overhead vapor phase. Now if the separator is operating at 62 psia and125
◦F , the vapor pressure of water at 125◦F is 2 psia, then the partial pressure acting
to condense the overhead vapor is 60 psia. Methyl mercaptan may condense underthese conditions but the heavier mercapans and the disulﬁde certainly will condense.The disulﬁdes are immiscible in aqueous alkaline efﬂuent and will form the upper oillayer to be skimmed off for disposal. The mercaptans that are condensed will form624 CHAPTER 14
mercaptides with the NaOH present. Since this will really occur in the feed/efﬂuent
exchanger when the reformed mercaptides are still in contact with the reactor airsupply and most if not all will be oxidized to disulﬁdes again.
The theoretical oxygen requirement for oxidizing mercaptides to disulﬁdes is 0.25
pounds per pound of mercaptide sulfur, and the theoretical air requirement is 1.09pounds per pound of sulfur. For convenience, the following value of the theory in thiscase can be taken as:
1 Theory =0.0091 (lb air/gal)/(1,000 ppm RSH-S)
Oxidation of sulﬁde to sulfate
The oxidation of sulﬁdes to thiosulﬁdes only reduces the ultimate oxygen demand of
the sulﬁdes from two pounds of oxygen per pound of sulﬁdes to one pond per pound ofsulﬁde. The oxidation to thiosulfate will remove the short term or immediate oxygendemand. Thiosulfate limits are not usually stipulated in water pollution regulationswhile sulﬁdes are always stipulated. In those cases where thiosulfates are a regulatedlimit it will be necessary to convert the thiosulfate to the sulfate. The chemistryrelating to this may be written as follows:
S
2−+2O2−→ SO2−
4
The above equation applies equally to aqueous ammonium sulﬁde and to sodium
sulﬁdes.
The theoretical oxygen requirement is 2 pounds per pound of S, and the theoretical air
requirement is 8.66 ponds per pound of S. The theoretical heat of reaction is 12,700Btu evolved/lb of S. That is one theory of air is:
0.072 (lb air/gal)/(1,000 ppm S)"
"The following table compares those units oxidizing to thiosulfates to those oxidizingto sulfates (Table 14.4). Although many units processing the sulﬁdes to sulfates donot use a catalyst but convert the sulﬁde to a mixture of thiosulfates and the sulfate.To convert the sulﬁde completely to the sulfate a copper chloride catalyst is used toaccelerate the reaction rate. The reaction of this conversion is quite slow without thecatalyst.
Oil–water separation
Most aqueous efﬂuents from a reﬁnery will contain oil. This oil content has to be
reduced to at least 10 ppm before it can be deposited into a river, lake or ocean. Theoil contamination sources are from process water run down, paved area drainage,THE REFINER Y ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 625

from these sources is treated in oil separation processes. The most important of theseoil–water separation process is the API Separator.
The API oil–water separator
The design of an API separator is based on the difference in gravity of oil and water
in accordance with the general laws of settling. These laws are given by the followingequations:
V=8.3×10

When the Re number is <2.0 use Stokes Law. When Re number is between 2 and
500 use the Intermediate Law. When the Re number is >500 use Newton’ sL a w .
The Re number in this case is given as10.7×dVS c
η
As a guide the minimum droplet size of the oil in water can be taken (as a minimum)
0.008 ins when the oil gravity is 0.850 or lighter and 0.005 ins when the gravity ofoil is greater than 0.850.
The above laws of settling in oil reﬁning processes usually apply to the hydrocarbon
being the continuous phase with water (the heavier phase) being the one that settlesout. In the case of the API separator the reverse is true. That is the continuous phaseis water and the lighter oil phase is the one that is separated to be disposed as theproduct skimmed from the surface. In the design of this system Stokes Law is used to
reﬂect the rate at which the oil rises to the surface through the water. This modiﬁedStokes law may be written as follows:

η=viscosity of the continuous phase (water) in centipoises.
An example of the application of the equation in the design of an API separator isgiven in Appendix 14.3.
The oil phase from the separator is removed using specially designed skim pipes and
an oil sump. A simpliﬁed diagram of a typical API separator is given in Figure 14.7.
Ancillary equipment used in the design and operation of the API separator are de-
scribed in the following items.
Oil skim pipes. As a good part of the oil will separate from the water on leaving the
inlet ﬂume and two oil retention bafﬂes with skim pipes are provided. One is located
ahead of the ﬂow bafﬂe and the other ahead of the overﬂow weir. The distance betweenthese bafﬂes will be the function ‘ L’ as calculated in Appendix 14.3. The API manual
recommends 10 ins diameter skim pipes where the horizontal run is less than 40 ft.Larger diameter skim pipes will be installed in greater horizontal runs.
The oil sump. The oil recovery sump is located at one edge mid way along the
horizontal run. The size of the sump is based on the oil content of the inlet stream toTHE REFINER Y ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 627

the separator plus four times that amount as water delivered by the skim pipes. For
example if the inlet stream contains 200 ppm by volume of oil and the water outletcontains 50 ppm Then the oil removal from the separator will be 150 ppm or 0.015%vol which in the case of the speciﬁcation given in Appendix 5.3 will equate to:
0.00015 ×600×1,440 =130 gals/day."
"Use the API recommendation to add to this ﬁgure four times this ﬁgure for the amountof water contained with the oil delivered by the skim pipes. Then the total liquid tothe sump will be 650 gals/day. For ease of operation a sump size is often based ona predicted weekly accumulation which amounts to 4,550 gals. Assume the sumpcross sectional area is 144 sqft (12 ft ×12 ft) then the liquid depth to NLL should
be 4,550/(7.48 ×144)=4.2 ft and the HLL can be set at 5 ft. To ensure adequate
gravity head for the oil removed by the skim pipes the bottom of the sump will be8 ft below the NLL of the separator.
The sump pump. The sump pump will be a standard vertical pump with a capacity to
pump out the entire sump in about 1 hr or less. Normally reﬁneries pump the sump
oil to the ‘ Bottom Settling Tanks’of the reﬁnery. These are tanks used to store thebottoms of crude oil tanks which usually contain high water and sediment content notsuitable for the normal process plants. The contents are allowed to sit for some time628 CHAPTER 14
and then returned as feed to the normal reﬁnery processes. The bottom settling from
these tanks are routed to the API separator.
Oil retention bafﬂes. API recommends that oil retention bafﬂes have a depth below
the level in the separator of 0.6–0.8 of the liquid level. Further the bafﬂe should extend
1 ft above the normal liquid level of the separator.
Distribution bafﬂes. An important feature in the design of the API separator is a
means of distributing the inﬂuent evenly. API recommends either ‘ V’shaped bafﬂes
or pipes installed at the inlet of the separator to be used for this purpose. It is alsorecommended that the the open area between slots be 3–7% of the chamber crosssectional area.
Sludge sumps. Sludge sumps are located immediately downstream of the distribution
bafﬂes. API recommends that these sumps should be at least 30 ins deep. That is 30
ins below the ﬂoor of the separator. The sludge pump suction is to extend to 6 insof the sump bottom and the suction line will be 3 ins diameter. Normally the sludgebottom will be 4 sqins in cross sectional area or 2 ins ×2 ins. API recommends that
these sumps slope a minimum of 1.7 ins vertical to 1.0 ins horizontal. In the case ofthe example design in Appendix 5.3 an 18 ins ×18 ins sumps sloping to the bottom
of 2 ins ×2 ins would give a slope of 1.9 which would meet the API recommendation.
Such a layout could accommodate 6 sumps.
Trash rack. API recommends that a trash rack made up of series of 3/8 ins rods on
1.5 ins centers be installed as a trash trap.
Storm surge ponds
These ponds are installed to provide storage for maximum rainfall conditions. There
are several forms of these surge ponds, some requiring pumps, some located upstreamof the API separator, and some downstream of the separator. In most cases the stormdrain system is directed to the storm surge pond. Thus in a storm the excess rainfall isheld in this pond and fed to the API separator, over a period of time and at a rate thatwill not exceed the separator’ s capability to handle the water effectively. In this waythe reﬁnery ensures that any oily water will not by-pass the separator under the worstcondition. The size of the surge pond must be able to handle the maximum rainfalland the ﬂow from all catch basins and open culverts that form part of the reﬁnerydrainage system.
Surge ponds are constructed with a shallow depth over a large surface area. Its location
is usually only slightly elevated above the API separator but near the low point ofthe reﬁnery. Thus, even when the pond is full the water, it will not ‘ back-up’to theprocess area drains.THE REFINER Y ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 629
Other reﬁnery water efﬂuent treatment processes
Oxidation pondsOxidation ponds are usually used as a secondary efﬂuent cleanup after the API sepa-
rator. There are three types of these ponds which are:
Aerobic. Where the oxidation of the water utilizes oxygen from the atmosphere plus
oxygen produced by photosynthesis.
Anaerobic. Where oxidation of the wastes does not utilize oxygen.
Aerated. Where oxidation of the wastes utilizes oxygen introduced from the atmo-
sphere by mechanical aeration.
Aerobic oxidation. Consider a shallow pond containing bacteria and algae. The bac-
teria will utilize oxygen to oxidize bio-chemically the incoming water. In so doing
it will produce H
2O, CO 2, and perhaps NH 3. The algae will utilize sunlight plus the
H2O and CO 2to produce oxygen. Oxygen in turn produces additional bacteria and
algea growth. This cycle is shown below:

Waste water out at reduced BOD
Air ﬂotation
The purpose of the air ﬂotation process is the clariﬁcation of waste water by the"
"removal of suspended solids and oil. This is achieved by dissolving air in waste waterunder pressure, and then releasing it at atmospheric pressure. The released air formsbubbles which adhere to the solid matter and oil in the waste water. The bubblescause the adhered matter to ﬂoat in the froth on the surface of the water bulk. Thedissolved air in the water also achieves a reduction in the BOD of the efﬂuent stream.Figure 14.8 shows the principle of a typical air ﬂotation process.630 CHAPTER 14

in the mixing tank with the raw water feed before the feed enters the ﬂotation vessel.
The processes described above are those found in oil reﬁning most often. Indeed of

14.2 Emission to the atmosphere
Oil reﬁners have two responsibilities with regard to atmospheric emissions. The ﬁrst
is to produce products that minimize the release of toxic or unacceptable emissionswhen used or stored. Much of this subject has been dealt with in Chapter 2 of thisvolume. The other responsibility, of course is to identify and control those unsavoryemissions from the reﬁning operation and processes. This is in keeping with all otherindustries that contain processes that have atmospheric emissions. It is this secondresponsibility that is addressed in this part of the chapter. It begins with a synopsisof the Clean Air Act. This Act is the basis of all standards and limits of control inthe atmospheric emission from industrial and other sources. The sections of the Actgiven in the following sections refer to the USA although most other countries followthese items quite closely.
Features of the Clean Air Act
The Clean Air Act reﬂects a numbers of revisions of a law ﬁrst passed in 1970. This
summary covers some of the important provisions of the Clean Air Act.
This summary is only a brief introduction to the Clean Air Act. The document itself
is much more extensive and provides details of all the most complicated aspects of airpollution. The reader should consult the latest versions and amendments to the CleanAir Act.
The role of the federal government and the role of the states
Although the Clean Air Act is a federal law covering the entire country, the states do
much of the work to implement the Act. For example, a state air pollution agency holdsa hearing on a permit application by a power or chemical plant or ﬁnes a companyfor violating air pollution limits.
Under this law, EPA sets limits on how much of a pollutant can be in the air anywhere
in the United States. This ensures that all Americans have the same basic health andenvironmental protections. The law allows individual states to have stronger pollutioncontrols, but states are not allowed to have weaker pollution controls than those setfor the whole country.
The law recognizes that it makes sense for states to take the lead in carrying out the
Clean Air Act, because pollution control problems often require special understandingof local industries, geography, housing patterns, etc.
States have to develop state implementation plans (SIPs) that explain how each state
will do its job under the Clean Air Act. A SIP is a collection of the regulations a632 CHAPTER 14
state will use to clean up polluted areas. The states must involve the public, through
hearings and opportunities to comment, in the development of each SIP .
EPA must approve each SIP , and if a SIP isn’ t acceptable, EPA can take over enforcing
the Clean Air Act in that state.
The United States government, through EPA, assists the states by providing scientiﬁc
research, expert studies, engineering designs and money to support clean air programs.
Interstate air pollutionAir pollution often travels from its source in one state to another state. In many"
"metropolitan areas, people live in one state and work or shop in an-other; air pollutionfrom cars and trucks may spread throughout the interstate area. The Clean Air Actprovides for interstate commissions on air pollution control, which are to developregional strategies for cleaning up air pollution. The Clean Air Act includes otherprovisions to reduce interstate air pollution.
International air pollutionAir pollution moves across national borders. The law covers pollution that originates
in Mexico and Canada and drifts into the United States and pollution from the UnitedStates that reaches Canada and Mexico.
PermitsOne of the major breakthroughs in the Clean Air Act is a permit program for larger
sources that release pollutants into the air [2].
[2] A source can be a power plant, factory or anything that releases pollutants into
the air. Cars, trucks and other motor vehicles are sources, and consumer products and
machines used in industry can be sources too. Sources that stay in one place are referredto as stationary sources; sources that move around, like cars or planes, are called mobilesources.
Requiring polluters to apply for a permit is not a new idea. Approximately 35 states
have had state-wide permit programs for air pollution. The Clean Water Act requirespermits to release pollutants into lakes, rivers or other waterways. Now air pollutionis also going to be managed by a national permit system. Under the new program,permits are issued by states or, when a state fails to carry out the Clean Air Actsatisfactorily, by EPA. The permit includes information on which pollutants are beingreleased, how much may be released, and what kinds of steps the source’ s owneror operator is taking to reduce pollution, including plans to monitor (measure) the
pollution. The permit system is especially useful for businesses covered by more thanTHE REFINER Y ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 633
one part of the law, since information about all of a source’ s air pollution will now
be in one place. The permit system simpliﬁes and clariﬁes businesses’obligationsfor cleaning up air pollution and, over time, can reduce paperwork. For instance, anelectric power plant may be covered by the acid rain, hazardous air pollutant andnon-attainment (smog) parts of the Clean Air Act; the detailed information requiredby all these separate sections will be in one place-on the permit.
Permit applications and permits are available to the public; contact your state or
regional air pollution control agency or EPA for information on access to these doc-uments.
Businesses seeking permits have to pay permit fees much like car owners paying for
car registrations. The money from the fees will help pay for state air pollution control
activities.
Enforcement
The Clean Air Act gives important new enforcement powers to EPA. It used to be
very difﬁcult for EPA to penalize a company for violating the Clean Air Act. EPA has
to go to court for even minor violations. The law enables EPA to ﬁne violators, muchlike a police ofﬁcer giving trafﬁc tickets. Other parts of the law increase penalties forviolating the Act and bring the Clean Air Act’ s enforcement powers in line with otherenvironmental laws.
Public participation
Public participation is a very important part of the Clean Air Act. Throughout the
Act, the public is given opportunities to take part in determining how the law will becarried out. For instance, you can take part in hearings on the state and local plans forcleaning up air pollution. Y ou can sue the government or a source’ s owner or operatorto get action when EPA or your state has not enforced the Act. Y ou can request actionby the state or EPA against violators.
The reports required by the Act are public documents. A great deal of information
will be collected on just how much pollution is being released; these monitoring(measuring) data will be available to the public. The Clean Air Act ordered EPA toset up clearinghouses to collect and give out technical information. Typically, theseclearinghouses will serve the public as well as state and other air pollution controlagencies. See the list at the end of this summary for organizations to contact foradditional information about air pollution and the Clean Air Act.634 CHAPTER 14
Market approaches for reducing air pollution: economic incentives
The Clean Air Act has many features designed to clean up air pollution as efﬁciently
and inexpensively as possible, letting businesses make choices on the best way to reachpollution cleanup goals. These new ﬂexible programs are called market or market-
based approaches. For instance, the acid rain clean-up program offers businesses
choices as to how they reach their pollution reduction goals and includes pollutionallowances that can be traded, bought and sold.
The Clean Air Act provides economic incentives for cleaning up pollution. For in-"
"stance, gasoline reﬁners can get credits if they produce cleaner gasoline than required,and they can use those credits when their gasoline doesn’ t quite meet clean-up re-quirements.
The major effects of air pollution and the most common pollutants
Air pollution can make people sick. It can cause burning eyes and nose and an itchy,
irritated throat, as well as trouble in breathing. Some chemicals found in polluted aircause cancer, birth defects, brain and nerve damage and long-term injury to the lungsand breathing passages. Some air pollutants are so dangerous that accidental releasescan cause serious injury or even death.
Air pollution can damage the environment. Trees, lakes and animals have been harmed
by air pollution. Air pollutants have thinned the protective ozone layer above the Earth;this loss of ozone could cause changes in the environment as well as more skin cancerand cataracts (eye damage) in people. Air pollution can damage property. It can dirtybuildings and other structures. Some common pollutants eat away stone, damagingbuildings, monuments and statues. Air pollution can cause haze, reducing visibilityin national parks and sometime interfering with aviation.
The Clean Air Act is aimed at improving air quality and therefore to protect the health
of the general public. The Act changed the way people work or do business, and itcould, in some ways, change the way people live.
Some of the major and more serious pollutants are described in the following sections
(see also Chapter 2 on ‘ Motive Fuels’ ).
SmogOften, wind blows smog-forming pollutants away from their sources. The smog-
forming reactions take place while the pollutants are being blown through the air byTHE REFINER Y ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 635
the wind. This explains why smog is often more severe miles away from the source
of smog-forming pollutants than it is at the source.
The smog-forming pollutants literally cook in the sky, and if it’ s hot and sunny, smog
forms more easily. Just as it takes time to bake a cake, it takes time to cook upsmog-several hours from the time pollutants get into the air until the smog gets reallybad. Weather and geography determine where smog goes and how bad it is. Whentemperature inversions occur (warm air stays near the ground instead of rising) andwinds are calm, smog may stay in place for days at a time. As trafﬁc and other sourcesadd more pollutants to the air, the smog gets worse.
Since smog travels across county and state lines, the respective local governments
and air pollution control agencies must cooperate to solve their problem.
The Clean Air Act is applied to reduce pollution from criteria air pollutants, including
smog, in this way.
First, EPA and state governors cooperate to identify non-attainment areas for each
criteria air pollutant. Then, EPA classiﬁes the non-attainment areas according to howbadly polluted the areas are. There are ﬁve classes of non-attainment areas for smog,ranging from marginal (relatively easy to clean up quickly) to extreme (will take a lot
of work and a long time to clean up).
The Clean Air Act uses this new classiﬁcation system to tailor clean-up requirements
to the severity of the pollution and set realistic deadlines for reaching clean-up goals.If deadlines are missed, the law allows more time to clean-up, but usually a non-attainment area that has missed a clean-up deadline will have to meet the stricterclean-up requirements set for more polluted areas.
Not only must non-attainment areas meet deadlines, states with non-attainment ar-
eas must show EPA that they are moving on clean-up before the deadline-makingreasonable further progress.
States will usually do most of the planning for cleaning up criteria air pollutants, using
the permit system to make sure power plants, factories and other pollution sourcesmeet their clean-up goals.
The comprehensive approach to reducing criteria air pollutants taken by the Act covers
many different sources and a variety of clean-up methods. Many of the smog clean-uprequirements involve motor vehicles (cars, trucks, buses). Also, as the pollution getsworse, pollution controls are required for smaller sources.636 CHAPTER 14
Acid rain
In addition to the commonly accepted term “ acid rain” , there are also acid snow, acid
fog or mist, acid gas and acid dust. All of these “ acids”are related air pollutants,that can harm health, cause hazy skies and damage the environment and property.The Clean Air Act includes an innovative program to reduce acid air pollutants (allreferred to here as “ acid rain” ).
The acid rain that has received the most attention is caused mainly by pollutants from
big coal burning power plants. Coal from most sources contains sulfur. Sulfur incoal becomes sulfur dioxide (SO
2) when coal is burned. Big power plants burn large
quantities of coal, so they release large amounts of sulfur dioxide, as well as NO x"
"(nitrogen oxides). These are acid chemicals, related to two strong acids: sulfuric acidand nitric acid. Reﬁneries too which burn heavy hydrocarbons such as fuel oils aresubject to the same scrutiny and restrictions that may be in force.
The sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides released from the burning of fossil fuels etc
are routed high into the air by the heater stacks and are carried by winds to areasremote from the actual source. When winds blow the acid chemicals into areas wherethere is wet weather, the acids become part of the rain, snow or fog. In areas wherethe weather is dry, the acid chemicals may fall to Earth in gases or dusts.
Lakes and streams are normally slightly acid, but acid rain can make them very
acid. Very acid conditions can damage plant and animal life. In the United Statesacid lakes and streams have been found all over the country. For instance, lakes inAcadia National Park on Maine’ s Mt. Desert Island have been very acidic, due topollution from the Midwest and the East Coast industries. Streams in Maryland andWest Virginia, lakes in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and lakes and streams inFlorida have also been affected by acid rain. Heavy rainstorms and melting snow cancause temporary increases in acidity in lakes and streams in the eastern and westernUnited States. These temporary increases may last for days or even weeks.
Acid rain does more than environmental damage; it can damage health and property
as well. Acid air pollution has been linked to breathing and lung problems in childrenand in people who have asthma. Even healthy people can have their lungs damagedby acid air pollutants. Acid air pollution can eat away stone buildings and statues.
Health, environmental and property damage can also occur when sulfur dioxide pol-
lutes areas close to its source. Sulfur dioxide pollution has been found in towns wherepaper and wood pulp are processed and in areas close to some power plants. The CleanAir Act’ s sulfur dioxide reduction program complements health-based sulfur dioxidepollution limits already in place to protect the public and the environment from bothnearby and distant sources of sulfur dioxide.THE REFINER Y ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 637
The Act as originally enacted in 1990 took a new nationwide approach to the acid
rain problem. The law set up a market based system designed to lower sulfur dioxide
pollution levels. Beginning in the year 2000, annual releases of sulfur dioxide wereto be about 40% lower than the 1980 levels. Reducing sulfur dioxide releases causeda major reduction in acid rain.
Phase I of the acid rain reduction program went into effect in 1995. Major users of
high sulfur fuels had to reduce releases of sulfur dioxide. In 2000, Phase II of the
acid rain program went into effect, further reducing the sulfur dioxide releases fromthe traditional sources, and covering other smaller polluters.
Reductions in sulfur dioxide releases are obtained through a program of emission
(release) allowances. EPA issues allowances to those industries covered by the acid
rain program; each allowance is worth one ton of sulfur dioxide released from the
smokestack. To obtain reductions in sulfur dioxide pollution, allowances are set belowthe current level of sulfur dioxide releases. Plants may only release as much sulfurdioxide as they have allowances. If a plant expects to release more sulfur dioxide thanit has allowances, it has to get more allowances, perhaps by buying them from anotherplant that has reduced its sulfur dioxide releases below its number of allowances andtherefore has allowances to sell or trade. Allowances can also be bought and sold by“ middlemen,” such as brokers, or by anyone who wants to take part in the allowancesmarket. Allowances can be traded and sold nationwide. There are stiff penalties forplants that release more pollutants than their allowances cover.

Monitoring atmospheric emission
Monitoring to develop an improved understanding of human activity on the local envi-
ronment is the primary activity of most industrialized countries today. In a great manycases independent consultants are used for this purpose. Normally these consultantswill set up a number of monitoring stations. For example in the highly industrial sec-tion of Eastern Canada (Ontario) and the neighboring cities in Eastern United Statesseveral of these stations are in operation. All instrumentation associated with thesestations is frequently cross-calibrated by the Ontario Ministry of Environment and En-ergy, the local regulatory agency. The existence of this monitoring network provides amajor cost beneﬁt to members, in that the regulatory agency accepts the co-operativemonitoring rather than requiring fenceline monitoring at individual facilities. Mon-itoring results are provided via telemetry to a central computer accessible throughremote terminals by each member. In this way, all members have real-time access tocurrent ambient conditions, and can respond quickly to changing ambient conditions.
The air monitoring stations are located within, as well as north and south of the
industrialized area, including the United States. Local winds are predominantly northor south, generally aligned with the river. Not all sites are completely instrumented;however, most contaminants of concern are well represented among the stations,including:
rSulfur dioxide, due to the many sources of heavy fuel combustion in the area;
rGround level ozone, as it is a chronic problem in much of urbanized North America,resulting in high levels during the summer months;
rNitrogen oxides, having been recognized as major contributors to ozone formation;
rNon-methane hydrocarbons, as they provide a simple measure of VOCs, importantin a large petrochemical complex, and are also contributors to ground level ozoneproblems;
rEthylene, which is monitored at most stations, is a major local commodity withhigh levels of local production and consumption;
rTotal reduced sulfur, which provides a general measure of potential odourants,important in such a concentration of industries;640 CHAPTER 14
rParticulates, measured as both Total Suspended Particulates and as Inhalable Par-
ticulates on a six day cycle corresponding to the cycle used on a national basis inCanada.
rWind speed and direction at 10 meters above ground level as this has proven to bevaluable component in assessing the atmospheric emission data."
"Trend data, such as average annual sulfur dioxide levels are available over manyyears. Data from the early 1960s showed sulfur dioxide routinely exceeding an annualaverage of 0.020 ppm. Data through the 1970s and 1980s demonstrated acceptablelevels and more recent data showed continuing reductions.
Reducing and controlling the atmospheric pollution in reﬁnery products
As stated earlier much of the atmospheric pollution from oil reﬁning is centered in
the pollution emitted by the products of that industry when they are utilized. Thus amajor effort in reﬁnery design and operation is geared to produce products that havea minimum effect on the environment and in particular atmospheric pollution. Thisresults in the research into reﬁning technology and product composition to change thecharacter of many of the traditional reﬁnery products. This is detailed in Chapter 2 ofthis volume. The following items included below are some additional requirementsthat are or have been adopted to minimize atmospheric pollution from motive fuels:
Each of today’ s cars produces 60–80% less pollution than cars in the 1960s. More
people are using mass transit. Leaded gas was phased out, resulting in dramaticdeclines in air levels of lead, a very toxic chemical. Despite this progress, most typesof air pollution from mobile sources have not improved signiﬁcantly.
At present in the United States:
rMotor vehicles are responsible for up to half of the smog-forming VOCs and nitrogen
oxides (NO
x)
rMotor vehicles release more than 50% of the hazardous air pollutants
rMotor vehicles release up to 90% of the CO found in urban air
What went wrong?
rMore people are driving more cars more miles on more trips. In 1970, Americanstraveled 1 trillion miles in motor vehicles; it is estimated that today they drive around5 trillion miles.
rMany people live far from where they work; in many areas, buses, subways, andcommuter trains are not available. Also, most people still drive to work alone, evenwhen van pools, high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes and other alternatives toone-person-per-car commuting are available.THE REFINER Y ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 641
rBuses and trucks, which produce a lot of pollution, haven’ t had to clean up their
engines and exhaust systems as much as cars.
Auto fuel has become more polluting. As lead was being phased out, gasoline reﬁnerschanged gasoline formulas to make up for octane loss, and the changes made gasolinemore likely to release smog-forming VOC vapors into the air.
Although cars have had pollution control devices since the 1970s, the devices only had
to work for 50,000 miles, while a car in the United States is usually driven for 100,000miles. The Clean Air Act took a comprehensive approach to reducing pollution from
motor vehicles. The Act provided for cleaning up fuels, cars, trucks, buses and othermotor vehicles. Auto inspection provisions were included in the law to make surecars are well maintained. The law also includes transportation policy changes thatcan help reduce air pollution.
Cleaner fuels
It will be very difﬁcult to obtain a signiﬁcant reduction in pollution from motor vehi-
cles unless fuels are cleaned up. The phase out of lead from gasoline was completedby January 1, 1996. Diesel fuel reﬁning must be changed so that the fuels contain lesssulfur, which contributes to acid rain and smog. Gasoline reﬁners will have to refor-
mulate gasoline sold in the smoggiest areas; this gasoline will contain less VOCs such
as benzene (which is also a hazardous air pollutant that causes cancer and aplasticanemia, a potentially fatal blood disease). Other polluted areas can ask EPA to includethem in the reformulated gasoline marketing program. In some areas, wintertime COpollution is caused by people starting their cars. In these areas, reﬁners have to selloxyfuel, gasoline with oxygen added, usually in the form of 10% ethanol, to make thefuel burn more efﬁciently, thereby reducing CO release.
All gasolines have to contain detergents, which, by preventing build-up of engine
deposits, keep engines working smoothly and burning fuel cleanly.The Clean Air Act encouraged development and sale of alternative fuels such as
alcohols, liqueﬁed petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gas.Gas stations in many areas have installed vapor recovery nozzles on gas pumps. These
nozzles cut down on vapor release when you put gas in your car.
Cleaner cars
The Clean Air Act required cars to have under-the-hood systems and dashboard warn-
ing lights that check whether pollution control devices are working properly. Pollu-tion control devices must work for 100,000 miles, rather than the older 50,000 miles.642 CHAPTER 14
Electric cars, which are low-pollution vehicles, are also available in California and,"
"more recently, hybrid cars that improve mileage by using a combined gasoline/electricmotor have been gaining in acceptance. Hydrogen-powered fuel cell cars are also be-ing used, but mostly experimentally in ﬂeet applications (e.g., some city buses).
Inspection and maintenance programs
Under the Clean Air Act, auto manufacturers are required to build cleaner cars, and
cars to use cleaner fuels. However, to get air pollution down and keep it down, a thirdprogram was implemented, vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M), which makes
sure cars are being maintained adequately to keep pollution emissions (releases) low.The Clean Air Act includes very speciﬁc requirements for I/M programs.
Before the Clean Air Act went into effect, seventy United States cities and several
states already had auto emission inspection programs. The law required that someareas that already had I/M programs enhance (improve) their emission inspectionmachines and procedures. Enhanced I/M machines and procedures give a better mea-surement of the pollution a car releases when it is actually being driven, rather than justsitting parked at the inspection station. Enhanced I/M programs resulted in changesin where and how cars are inspected in local areas. The added expense for the newmachinery more than made up for by air pollution reductions: emission I/M programs
are expected to have a big payoff in reducing air pollution from cars.
Cleaner trucks and buses
Starting with model year 1994, engines for new big diesel trucks had to be built
to reduce particulate (dust, soot) releases by 90%. Buses had to reduce particulate
releases even more than trucks. To reduce pollution, companies and governmentsthat own buses or trucks had to buy new clean models. Introduction of ultra low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) is expected to greatly assist in these efforts. Small trucks willeventually be cleaned up by requirements similar to those for cars.
Non-road vehicles
Locomotives, construction equipment and even riding mowers may be regulated under
the Clean Air Act. Air pollution from locomotives must be reduced. For the other non-road vehicles, EPA can issue regulations if a study shows that controls would help cutpollution.
Transportation policies
The smoggiest metropolitan areas had to change their transportation policies to dis-
courage unnecessary auto use, and to encourage efﬁcient commuting (van pools, HOVlanes, etc.).THE REFINER Y ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 643
Controlling emission pollution from the reﬁning processes
Most oil reﬁneries do not have the very hazardous emissions usually met in petro-
chemical or chemical plants. In most reﬁneries the pollution that is met with is in theburning of fuels that may contain high levels of sulfur or nitrogen compounds. Theemission of VOCs is usually restricted to storage tanks and in some cases relief valvesopen to atmosphere. The release of particulates from certain process plants such asthe FCCU and the Coking units is an emission that reﬁners can handle quite well.
In all cases the pollution control in a reﬁnery starts with the design of the processes
and systems themselves, and extends to their proper operation. Some of the measuresundertaken to meet the Clean Air Act in the reﬁning industry are as follows:
Fired heatersAlmost all reﬁnery heaters have double service burners. That is the heater burners
can ﬁre fuel gas, or fuel oil. The fuel gas stream will usually have been treated forthe removal of sulfur, in the gas treating plant. So normally this fuel source is not amajor pollutant problem. However all reﬁneries have a ‘ waste liquid’pool, and thisis used as the fuel oil stream to the heaters. Unless properly treated either in terms ofthe streams that are routed to this pool or indeed the fuel oil pool itself, it becomesthe source for SO
2pollution. The treatment must reduce the fuel oils sulfur content to
acceptable levels that, when burnt in the ﬁre box, the ﬂue gases satisfy the SO 2levels
called for by the Act. Almost all reﬁneries today hydrotreat most product streamsfor the removal of sulfur and nitrogen except perhaps the very heavy residue stream.Where these residue streams are used as part of the fuel oil pool they are usuallyblended with hydrotreated middle distillate streams (gasoil, or even kero) to reducethe total stream sulfur. The individual reﬁnery planning schedules will be tailored tomeet this reﬁnery fuel criteria.
The emission of NO
xis quite another problem and this is usually controlled by the
minimum amount of excess air that is necessary for proper heater operation. The
solution to this problem often starts in the ﬁred heater manufacturer’ s design shopwhere the best heater ﬁre box geometry can assist in lowering or at least maintainingthe required excess air criteria and in the use of low NO
xburners. Modern reﬁnery"
"design engineering takes note of the stack height requirements so that the emissionfall out avoids populated areas as much as possible. It is now common reﬁningengineering practice among major contractors and heater manufacturers to utilizedeveloped computer programs which deﬁne the fallout contours at ground leveldistances from ﬁred heater stacks. These contour map programs are based on fueltype and burning data, the proposed stack height, the prevailing wind direction,and speed. The maps are used in the reﬁnery layout studies (for new reﬁneriesbeing engineered) in terms of locating processes and their ﬁred heaters on the plant644 CHAPTER 14
site. This assists in avoiding wherever possible particulate and other pollutants
contaminating high populated and ecologically sensitive areas.
Particulate emission from the ﬂuid catalytic cracking unit
The process most vulnerable to this type of pollutant emission is the Fluid Catalytic
Unit (FCCU). In this case the emission of the particulates is either a problem inoperation or less frequently a break down of protection equipment— in particular thecyclone separators located in the critical areas of the process (for example, in the re-actor outlet and the regenerator ﬂue gas outlet). The most common problem in ﬂuidizedbed processes are air surges that cause a disruption of the ﬂuidized bed. In the case ofthe FCCU this ﬂuidized bed is the catalyst bed being regenerated in the regenerator.This disruption results in loss of the catalyst to atmosphere from the regenerator exitstack. The incorporation of a CO boiler however does minimize this emission tosome extent. Usually these air surges are minimized by good ﬂow control systemswith some anti surge system. The malfunction of the cyclones is a much more seriousproblem which results in a plant shut down for repair.
VOC emission from reﬁnery facilities
The major sources of atmospheric pollution by VOC emission in reﬁnery are as
follows:
rRelief and vent valves open to atmosphere
rLeaks from poorly maintained control valves and ﬂanged joints
rStorage tanks
rRail and road tanker ﬁlling facilities
rShip loading and unloading facilities (jetty area).
Relief and vent valves normally discharge to a closed relief header which is routed toﬂare system. However in some cases, because of the location of the relief and/or ventvalve and the quantity of the discharge material the valve(s) are open to atmosphere.A typical example is the crude distillation unit relief valves. These are located at thetop of the distillation towers at about 200 ft above grade. Steam injection facilitiesare installed at the valve discharge to facilitated atomization and dispersion. Never-theless when these valves do open there will be some considerable VOC emission toatmosphere. Any unscheduled event that would cause these valves to discharge areextremely rare and do not warrant the extensive costs of increased ﬂare header andﬂare design that would be necessary to cater for these valve discharges.
Leaks from control (and other valves), pump seals, packing, and ﬂanged joints are
related entirely to the reﬁnery’ s maintenance policy and program.THE REFINER Y ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 645
Perhaps the biggest source of VOC from a reﬁnery and its operation is from the
storage tanks. This emission occurs during the tank ﬁlling, particularly in the case ofﬁxed roof tanks and LPG bullets and spheres. The emissions from ﬂoating roof tanksare generally quite low and the function of a properly installed roof should sufﬁce inminimizing the emission from this source. Many of today’ s reﬁneries have installeda closed inert gas circulating system. This system circulates an inert gas (mostlynitrogen) throughout the reﬁnery for many purposes which requires the absence ofoxygen in the air. One of these is the use of inert blanketing of ﬁxed roof tanks.Blanketing is often required in intermediate tanks whose contents are feed to processeswhich need to eliminate oxygen. Extension of this inert gas to all ﬁxed roof tanks as ablanket prevents the emission of VOC during their ﬁlling. The storage of LPG is alsoa potential for emitting VOC to the atmosphere. One method used to combat this is toﬂoat the make/break valves of the spheres and bullets on the reﬁnery fuel gas main.
Spillages from truck and railcar loading facilities have always been problematic.
Most spillages occur when ﬁlling the vessels. Most loading facilities nowadays haveautomatic shut off on the loading arm nozzles, very similar to those commonly usedin public ﬁlling stations. These operate using a level sensitive device which closes theﬁlling valve at a prescribed ﬁlling level in the tank. The other source of VOC emissionis a poorly designed slop system that allows the draining of bottoms from road tankersand railcars. Such a system should allow for steam out facilities on vessels carryingheavy petroleum cuts. Vents on this system should be routed to the ﬂare header."
"The jetty and ship loading and unloading is also a potential source of VOC emission.
Again as in the case of the tank farm and product loading facilities the most vulnerableproduct in this respect is the handling of the light hydrocarbon streams. In the loadingof LPG a ﬂash recycle system has been found to be effective. In this system the ﬂashedLPG which occurs as the LPG ﬁrst enters the ships tank which when empty would beclose to atmospheric pressure and temperature. This ﬂashed vapor is then routedunder pressure control to a compressor and cooler assembly where it is liqueﬁed andreturned to the LPG feed stream. The system continues to operate throughout theloading activity acting then as the loading relief system.
Other sources of emissions of atmospheric pollutants
The most notable of these is the reﬁnery sulfur recovery plant, and in particular the
sulfur storage pit. Most reﬁneries have a sub-surface tiled pit for storing the liquidsulfur product from the sulfur plant. This pit is covered by concrete or other suitableslabs. These are sealed to prevent the emission of the SO
2that is always present above
the liquid sulfur. The SO 2that does accumulate is normally vented off to a small
bullet partially ﬁlled with water. The ensuing sulfuric acid formed is either used inthe reﬁnery for caustic neutralization or sold to other users.646 CHAPTER 14
In bitumen production the heavy vacuum residue, which is the basis for most bitumen
grades, may be air blown. This becomes necessary to meet certain bitumen grades.The air used in this air blowing procedure must be perfectly dry to avoid an explosionin the reactor vessel. (Refer to Chapter 3.9 for details on the air blowing process.)Under normal operating conditions the vapors exiting the reactor vessel are routed tothe ﬂare header. Occasionally however an explosion does occur in the reactor. Whenthis does happen the explosion doors (located at the top of the vessel) blow open.This emits the reactor vapors which are high in SO
2and VOCs. The plant usually
returns to normal pretty quickly, and the explosion doors close as the pressure insidethe vessel returns to normal. There is no way to eliminate the effect of this occurrenceexcept, perhaps, to ensure that the air used be dry.
14.3 Noise pollution
Noise problems and typical in-plant/community noise standardsNoise has been widely organized as a major industrial/environmental problem in
most processing plants because of the risk of hearing loss involved when workers areexposed to high noise levels.
The high noise levels in process plants can be attributed to a great number of sources.
Major noise sources are compressors, fans, pumps, motors, furnaces, control valves,steam and gas turbines, and piping systems. The noise generating mechanism for eachpiece of equipment is complex but, in most cases, the noise levels can be reduced todesired limits through the implementation of proper noise control measures.
With increasing awareness of the noise problem and its effect on the general public,
regulations on noise standards have been adapted in many countries throughout theworld. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) of 1970(29 CFR 1910.95) and the Noise Control Act of 1972 and later amendments haveserved as basic guidelines for noise control requirements. OSHA contains maximumpermissible sound pressure levels for each daily time of exposure. These guidelinesare presented in Table 14.6 and serve as a basis for in-plant noise criteria for anyprocess plant constructed in the United States.
Conversely, community noise criteria are more variable and depend on a number
of factors including local ordinances, existing noise levels and the site of the plantwith respect to the community. Some typical community noise limits are shown inTable 14.7.
The art of acoustics and noise control is beyond the scope of this paper. Only the most
important concepts necessary for an analysis of process plant noise will be considered.THE REFINER Y ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 647

The classiﬁcation of different areas of the community in terms of environmental noise
zones shall be determined by the Noise Control Ofﬁce, based upon assessment ofcommunity noise survey data.
The Noise Control Act of 1972, administered by the Environmental Protection
Agency, was intended to establish federal noise emission standards. This act served abroader scope of coordinating all noise control efforts and places the primary respon-sibility for noise control on the states. Please refer to current and local regulations.

(1)Sound pressure level
Sound is a ﬂuctuation in the pressure of the atmosphere at a given point. Soundpressure level is expressed as a ratio of the particular sound pressure and a refer-ence sound pressure:
SPL=10 logp

P2
ref
where
SPL=sound pressure level in dB (decibel)
P2=mean square amplitude of the pressure variation
Pref=2×10−5N/m2
(2)Sound power level
Sound power level is deﬁned as the ratio of the particular sound power and thereference power:
PWL=10 logW
Wref
where
W=sound power (rate of acoustic energy ﬂow) in acoustic watt
Wref=10−12Watt.
The relationship between SPL and PWL is:
SPL=PWL+K
where
K=a constant dependent upon geometry and other aspects of the situation.
(3)WavelengthConsideration of the wavelength is important to noise control.It is deﬁned as:
λ=C
f
where
λ=wavelength in feet
C=speed of sound in feet per second
f=frequency, cycles per second (Hz)
(4)Octave bandAn Octave refers to a doubling of frequency. Generally, the audible frequencyrange consists of ten preferred octave bands with following center frequencies:31.5, 63, 125, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 4,000, 8,000, and 16,000.THE REFINER Y ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 649

(5)A-weighted sound pressure level (dBA)
Most noise regulations set the maximum allowable noise limits based on the useof the “ A”weighting network which provides a popular means of rating noise.This network is designed to account for the response of the human ear. The other“ B” and “ C” weighting networks are no longer in common use. Table 14.8 showsA-weighting network band correction for each octave band to convert the soundpressure level (dB) to an A-weighted sound pressure level (dBA).
(6)Adding decibelsThe noise levels expressed in decibels cannot be added arithmetically but theaddition should be performed on the basis of energy addition. Therefore, thecombined dB level is determined by:
dB

i10 dB i/10
where
dBtotal=the combined dB level
dBi=the individual dB level
N=the total number of dB levels
(7)Sound ﬁelds
A sound ﬁeld is a description of the relationship between the PWL of the sourceand the SPL at different points in the surrounding space.
(a)Idealized sound ﬁeld:The sound ﬁeld for an idealized sound sources which can be considered as avery small, uniformly pulsating sphere is given by the following equation:
SPL=PWL−20 log r+KdB
where
r=distance from source to measurement point
K=a constant650 CHAPTER 14

Q=directivity factor in the direction of interest
r=distance from source in feet.

where

(8)DirectivityThe directivity factor may be deﬁned as the ratio of the mean square soundpressure at a given distance in a particular direction to the value which wouldexist if the source were non-directional. The directivity is deﬁned by:
DI=10 log Q
where
Q=directivity factor in the direction of interest
Some typical directivity indices are shown in Table 14.9.
(9)Sound propagationThe propagation of sound waves can be affected by a number of factors. Thefactors important to noise control consists of sound absorption, transmissionloss, barriers, atmospheric, and terrain effects.

Sound waves traveling in an enclosed space are affected by the absorptivequality of the incident surface. The amount of absorption is expressed as:
R=S·ab

where
R=room constant in sqft.
S=total interior surface area in sqft.

(b)Transmission loss:The sound isolating capability of a wall is deﬁned as:
TL=10 log1
τdB
where
τ=transmission coefﬁcient (ratio of transmitted sound intensity to
incident sound intensity)
(c)Barriers:Appreciable sound attenuation can often be obtained by interposing a barrieror acoustical shield between the source and receiver. The sound attenuationof a barrier is given approximately by:
B=10 log20H

λr
where
B=reduction of the sound pressure level at a given frequency
H=effective barrier height
r=distance from source to barrier
λ=wavelength of sound at the frequency being considered"
"(d)Atmospheric and terrain effects:The propagation of sound outdoors at long distances may be signiﬁcantlyinﬂuenced by atmospheric and terrain effects. Sound propagated through theatmosphere is subject to small energy losses due to molecular effects. Thisloss is dependent upon air temperature and relative humidity. The moleculareffects for 72
◦F and 50% RH> are shown in Table 14.10.
The other effects resulting in noise reduction include attenuation due to sub-stantial vegetation, the effects of uneven terrain and tall buildings, and theeffects of wind and temperature gradients. These effects are more complexand, in most cases, can be neglected in a process plant noise analysis.652 CHAPTER 14

Coping with noise in the design phase
Because of local, state and/or federal noise regulations which establish the maximum
noise reception limits, permission to build or expand any signiﬁcant industrial facilitymay be dependent on predicting that the reception limits set by the controlling agencywill not be exceeded.
Consequently, noise control engineering must be commenced early in the design stage.

(a)Plant noise design targets:
Design criteria should be developed early in the design stage with considerationsgiven to federal, state and local laws, client standards, proximity and type ofadjacent communities as well as anticipated community growth patterns.
(b)Development of mechanical equipment and control valve noise criteria:Criteria for individual items of equipment will be developed to meet plant noisedesign objectives and will be made part of inquiry speciﬁcations for all noise-generating equipment.
(c)Preparation of preliminary noise contour map:Noise reception levels will be predicted using the engineering company’ s in houseestimate data bank and noise prediction computer programs.
(d)Preparation of noise control budget:A budget is prepared which identiﬁes funds necessary to implement noise controlmeasures.
(e)Plot plan assistance:Equipment location can be optimized based on projected noise levels which willminimize the need of attenuation treatment.
(f)Noise control recommendations:Recommendations for noise attenuation are prepared based on the contributionof all major equipment to the composite noise level, of a given plant area.
(g)Preparation of ﬁnal noise contour map:After ﬁnal noise level data have been obtained, the plot plan has been ﬁnalized andany noise control measures have been implemented, a noise contour map can beprepared. The noise contour map identiﬁes that the plant noise design objectiveshave been met. This contour map is normally prepared using the company’ so w n
modeling program. Alternatively a proprietary program can be leased from anappropriate soft ware company.
An effective noise control program requires an analysis in the early stage of plantdesign when no equipment has been purchased. The most efﬁcient and economicalapproach to nose control is to include noise control features as an integral part ofequipment design through equipment speciﬁcations. An optimal plot plan arrange-ment can also minimize the need for attenuation treatment by strategically locatingnoisy equipment or positioning process areas or known noise sources at maximum dis-tances from sensitive areas. The task of predicting noise levels to be used in the designphase can be overwhelming without the aid of the computer. A typical project mayinvolve hundreds of thousands of noise sources, and attempting to do the noise levelpredictions by hand computer program to predict community/in-plant noise levels.This program is discussed below in “ a typical community/in-plant noise program” .
A typical community/in-plant noise program
The noise pollution cycle is one of emission, propagation and reception. A computer
program is usually developed to simulate the noise propagation from several types of654 CHAPTER 14
noise sources with different conﬁgurations. This section will describe the capabilities
of such a program and its application to plant design.
(1)Capabilities
The computer program calculates sound pressure levels generated by single ormultiple noise sources at speciﬁed grid points or special receptors. This programshould utilize a simple algorithm to simulate the propagation of four differentsource models. These models include point, line, discrete points on a line, andplane sources.
(2)The Mathematical modelThe basic equation used in the program is:
SPL=PWL+10 log [ F(R)]+DI+K−AE
where"
"SPL=sound pressure at any receptor in dB
PWL=source sound power level in dB
10 log[ F(R)]=distance attenuation factor for various types of source whichwill be deﬁned in the following paragraphs in dB
DI=directivity index in dB
K=Characteristic resistance of air in dB
AE=total excess attenuation factor (molecular absorption, Groundabsorption, screening effect, barrier effect, etc.) in dB.

In-plant shielding corrections may be included in the ground absorptioncorrection. Corrections due to the effect of wind, temperature gradients, rain, sleetand barriers will be added at a future date.

(i)Input data requirements
The requirements for each noise source are basically the source sound power
spectrum, the source location and the desired noise level prediction model.Additionally, excess attenuation factors including molecular and ground ab-sorption data can be input if available.
(ii)Output
In the program described here, all the input data will be summarized and thecalculation results will be printed in the computer print out. The calculatedoctave band sound pressure level, overall sound pressure levels, and A-weightedsound pressure levels will be tabulated for all the special receptors speciﬁed.The calculated A-weighted sound pressure levels for all grid points will alsobe listed in the computer printout.Special routines are available to draw conﬁgurations of equipment normallypresent in a process plant, such as round-headed vessels, cooling towers, aircoolers, and ﬁred heaters.
(iii) Applications
The community/in-plant noise program described here can be used to performthe following applications:
rEstimating the net noise impact due to a prospective industrial activity
rChecking plant design for compliance with noise regulations
rEstablishing noise emission levels and plant design necessary to complywith the applicable environmental regulations
As with other computer programs, the accuracy of computer-calculated noiselevels depends on the accuracy of the input data as well as the application ofthe model selected for a particular noise source.THE REFINER Y ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 657

Appendix 14.2: Example of the design of a sour water stripper with no reﬂux
SpeciﬁcationFeed: The tower is to be designed to handle 200 gpm (at 100
◦F) of sour water con-
taining 10,000 ppm of H 2S and 7,500 ppm of NH 3(by weight).
Unit: The unit shall be a trayed column using sieve trays (efﬁciency of 0.5) with no
reﬂux.
Steam rate: Reﬁnery 50 psig saturated steam shall be used at a rate of 1.3 lbs/gpm of
feed.Tower pressure and temperature: The vapors leaving the tower top shall have sufﬁcient
pressure to enter a ‘ Rat Tail’burner in a nearby heater. The tower top pressure shall
be 20 psia. The feed entering the top tray shall be preheated to a temperature of 200
◦F.
Total tower pressure drop shall be 2 psi.
Stripped water speciﬁcation: The tower shall be designed and operated to remove
99.0% of the H 2S in the feed and 95% of the NH 3.
The design
Assume the stripping will be accomplished using four theoretical trays. Then at an
efﬁciency of 0.5 the number of actual trays will be 8. The pressure drop per tray willbe 0.25 (that is 2 psi/8 trays).
Calculate feed mass per hour:
Water @ 100
◦F has a speciﬁc volume of 0.1207 gals/lb.
Then 200 gpm of water =200×60
0.1207=99,420 lbs/hr.

Then steam used for heating =99,420(33/924) =3,550 lbs/hr.
And steam used for stripping =15,550 −3,550 =12,000 lbs/hr.

Reﬁnery safety measures and handling
of hazardous materials
D.S.J. Jones
Introduction
From the very nature of crude oil, its reﬁning and the processes relating to its operation
provide an extremely hazardous situation. Above all, of course, is the inherent dangerof ﬁre. Considerable steps are taken therefore to prevent this, and if a ﬁre does occur,to combat and restrain it in the most effective manner.
Although the ﬁre hazard is always the primary concern in the reﬁning of petroleum,"
"there are other hazards that are present and always need to be addressed. Amongthese are the handling of toxic and dangerous chemicals that are used in the reﬁningprocesses. There is also always present the danger to life of toxic products that areproduced in some of the reﬁning processes. Perhaps the most notable is hydrogensulﬁde, which is common to all modern reﬁneries.
This chapter deals ﬁrst of all with the nature and handling of these common hazardous
materials (Part 1). The chapter then continues with the description and discussion ofthose basic ﬁre protection methods used in reﬁnery design and operation (Part 2).
15.1 Handling of hazardous materials
Anhydrous hydroﬂuoric acidBecause of anhydrous hydroﬂuoric acid’ s (AHFs) highly toxic and corrosive nature,
this item is included to highlight its characteristics and the safe handling of the acid.
Anhydrous hydroﬂuoric acid is a colorless, mobile liquid which boils at 67
◦Fa t
atmospheric pressure, and therefore requires pressure containers. The acid is also
hygroscopic therefore its vapor combines with the moisture of air to form “ fumes” .This tendency to fume provides users with a built-in detector of leaks in AHF storage

and transfer equipment. On the other hand, care is needed to avoid accidental spillage
of water into tanks containing AHF . Dilution is accompanied by a high release ofheat. The physical properties of AHF are given in Table 15.1.
AHF vapor, even at very low concentrations in air, has a sharp penetrating odor that is
an effective deterrent to willful overexposure by operating personnel. Both the vaporand liquid forms of AHF cause severe and painful burns on contact with the skin,eyes, or mucous membranes.
Hydroﬂuoric acid is very corrosive. It attacks glass, concrete, and some metals—
especially cast iron and alloys which contain silica (e.g., Bessemer steels). The acidalso attacks such organic materials as leather, natural rubber, and wood, but does notpromote their combustion.
Although AHF is non-ﬂammable, its corrosive action on metals, particularly in the
presence of moisture, can result in hydrogen forming in containers and piping tocreate a ﬁre and explosion hazard. Potential sources of ignition (sparks and ﬂames)should be excluded from areas around equipment containing hydroﬂuoric acid.
Despite its corrosive nature, AHF can be handled with relative safety if the haz-
ards are recognized and the necessary precautions taken. This item describes certainprocedures for the safe handling of large bulk quantities of AHF .
Safe handling
The safe handling of AHF requires that well-designed equipment be properly operated
and maintained by well-trained, adequately protected, responsible personnel.
Tanks and other containers of AHF should be protected from heat and the direct rays
of the sun. Storage-area temperatures should preferably remain below 100
◦F . If they
reach or exceed 125◦F , means for cooling the containers must be applied.
Acid-transfer lines between the unloading station and the storage tank should tilttoward the latter to insure free drainage. Relief valves should be installed in thosesections of acid-transfer lines where acid may be entrapped between two closed valvesHANDLING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND SAFETY 677
in the line, because expansion of the liquid might create excessive pressure and rupture
the line.
No open ﬁres, open lights, or matches should be allowed in or around acid containers or
lines. The possibility of acid acting on metal to produce hydrogen gas is ever present.Only non-sparking tools and spark-proof electrical equipment should be used in theAHF storage and handling areas.
Safety showers should be readily accessible at the unloading station, in the storage
area, and at other locations where acid is handled. The showers should be capable ofsupplying volume ﬂows of 30 GPM through quick-opening valves in 2-inch waterlines. Handles at hip level should actuate the valves which, with a 0.25-inch weep holedirectly above the valve, should be positioned below the frost line and surrounded bycrushed rock or gravel to provide drainage.
A water hydrant and hose should also be available in the unloading area to ﬂush away
spilled acid. Good drainage should be provided, and also a supply of dry soda ash,ground limestone, or hydrated builders lime. Accidental spills of acid on walkwaysor equipment should be washed off immediately with large volumes of water and, ifnecessary, neutralized with one of the agents mentioned.
Personal protective equipment
Personal protective equipment is not a substitute for good, safe working conditions."
"Its purpose is to protect the wearer in the event of an accident— major or minor.The extent of protection needed depends upon the degree of exposure attending theparticular job at hand. Protective equipment should not be worn or carried beyondthe operating area. It should be thoroughly washed with sodium bicarbonate solutionimmediately after each use.
The minimum protection required for operating and maintenance personnel includes
the following items:
rCoveralls with sleeves to the wrists
rFace shield or chemical safety goggles
rHard hat
rPoly(vinyl chloride)— or neoprene-dipped gauntlets
rPoly(vinyl chloride)— or neoprene-soled rubber shoes
When taking acid samples, opening equipment which may contain hydroﬂuoric acid,or performing similar hazardous duties, operators should wear the following:
rPoly(vinyl chloride) or neoprene overalls
rPoly(vinyl chloride) or neoprene boots
rLightweight poly(vinyl chloride) or neoprene gloves under poly(vinyl chloride)— orneoprene-dipped gauntlets678 CHAPTER 15
rPoly(vinyl chloride) or neoprene jumper
rAirline hood
Air should be applied to the hood until the absence of fumes in the work area has
been fully established.
Unloading and transfer of AHF
AHF is shipped in rail tank cars having capacities ranging from approximately 5,400
gallons to 25,000 gallons and in road tank trucks of approximately 5,250 gallons AHFcapacity. Compressed dry gas (air, hydrocarbon, or nitrogen) is the preferred meansfor transferring bulk quantities of AHF , but a centrifugal, rotary or positive-pressurepump can be used if necessary.
The unloading of AHF tank cars or tank trucks, with transfer of the acid to plant
storage, consists of ﬁve steps:
(1) Spotting the tank car or tank truck at the unloading station.
(2) Connecting the plant compressed-gas (or vapor) and AHF-unloading lines to the
proper valves on the carrier tank.
(3) Transferring the AHF from the carrier tank to the storage tank.(4) Disconnecting the plant compressed-gas (or vapor) and AHF-unloading lines
from the carrier tank valves.
(5) Releasing the tank car or tank truck for return to the shipper.
Equipment
Mild steel is satisfactory for storing and handling AHF at temperatures up to 150
◦F
maximum. Type 300 stainless steels are useful up to 200◦F. “Monel” nickel-copper
alloy and “ Hastelloy” C nickel steel are suitable for higher temperatures. TEFLONTFE ﬂuorocarbon resin is completely resistant to all concentrations of hydroﬂuoricacid at temperatures up to 500
◦F.
Steel should not be used for movable parts because the corrosion-product ﬁlm willcause movable parts to “ freeze” . Cast iron, type 400 stainless steel, and hardenedsteels are unsatisfactory for AHF handling. Copper is velocity-sensitive. StressedMonel may stress crack if exposed to moist vapors or aerated acid containing water.Welds in Monel corrode rapidly.
The selection of construction materials used for AHF equipment depends very much
on such corrosion-affecting variables as moisture, temperature, aeration, ﬂuid veloc-ity, and impurities. Each storage and handling situation requires separate study toevaluate these factors before selecting materials which must meet the requirementsof the installation.HANDLING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND SAFETY 679
Storage tank. The capacity of the storage system should be approximately 11/2times
the maximum quantity normally ordered to insure against running out of acid between
receipt of shipments. As a rule, too large a storage system is preferable to too small asystem. The additional investment required for the larger installation is not great. Thelarger installation permits further expansion, less precise scheduling of shipments,and larger inventories when desired.
The horizontal cylindrical storage tank should be manufactured according to the
current ASME Code for Unﬁred Pressure Vessels or other equivalent codes whichmeet State or local mandatory requirements. It is further recommended that the wallthickness of the tank be at least 1/8 inch in excess of the ASME Code requirements.The tank should be double-welded, butt-joint construction, the welds to be slag-free (conforming to ASME Code, Section 8) and ground smooth inside to facilitateinspection. X-ray inspection of welds is recommended.
The storage tank should be suitably supported above ground level. Structural steel
supports or concrete saddles (protected with an acid-resistant paint) are satisfactory.
Safety devices for relieving abnormal internal tank pressures should be obtained from
qualiﬁed manufacturers who are familiar with AHF . The maximum working pressureof the storage system should not exceed 2/3 the rated relief or bursting pressure ofthe safety devices. The dual relief system is recommended which has a 2-way valveand rupture discs ahead of the relief valves and also a separate rupture-disc line incase of relief valve failure.
Piping. All pipe lines should be installed so that they drain toward the storage tank,"
"or toward the point of consumption. This will prevent the accumulation of acid in
low points, thereby eliminating possible safety hazards when repairs are necessary.Relief valves should be installed in the various sections of the lines in case acidbecomes conﬁned between two closed valves in the line. All ﬂanges in the linesshould preferably be coated with an acid-indicating paint such as Mobil #220-Y -7hydroﬂuoric acid-detecting paint, which changes in color from orange to yellow inthe presence of AHF liquid or vapor.
The line from the unloading station to the storage tank should be equipped with a
gate valve so acid ﬂow can be stopped at any time. The line should also be securelyanchored to the storage tank as considerable vibration may occur, especially whenunloading by means of compressed gas.
Extra heavy (Schedule 80) or, better, triple extra-heavy black seamless or welded steel
pipe which is free from non-metallic inclusions is satisfactory.
Fittings. Larger lines (2 ins and over) should preferably be welded to conform to
ASME Code, Section 8. Alternatively, properly gasketed forged steel ﬂanges can be
used.680 CHAPTER 15
On smaller lines, extra-heavy forged steel, screw-type unions with steel-to-steel seats
can be used for pipe joints. Graphite-and-oil is satisfactory as lubricant.
Gaskets. Gaskets made of TEFLON TFE ﬂuorocarbon resin are recommended.
V alves. Jamesbury “ Double-Seal”ball valves have given excellent service to AHF
manufacturing operations. The valve seats are preferably of TEFLON TFE; the balls
and bodies of 316 stainless steel, “ Durimet”20 austenitic stainless steel alloy, orequivalent. Gate valves should be of the O, S, and Y ﬂange type, with a ring ofTEFLON TFE or “ Kel-F” ﬂuorocarbon thermoplastic material on the plug seat andpacking of either TEFLON TFE or Kel-F .
Globe valves can be of Monel nickel-copper alloy or have a forged steel body and
trim of Monel.
Good service has been reported for Hills–McCanna diaphragm valves with body of
Durimet 20 or equivalent, or Monel alloy; diaphragm of polyethylene, Kel-F , or alaminate of neoprene and TEFLON TFE; and a wheel closure.
Plug valves of Monel with a sleeve of TEFLON TFE have been found satisfactory.Check valves should be of the forged ball and body type— made of Monel metal.Pressure gauges. Pressure gauges should be constructed of 316 stainless steel or
Monel metal Bourdon tubes. The bottom connection of the gauge should be
1/2-inch.
The case should have a “ blow-out” back.Pumps. Centrifugal, rotary or positive-pressure types of pumps are satisfactory. The
300 series stainless steels; Durimet 20 or equivalent, Hastelloy C, Monel alloys; nickel,
bronze, and acid bronze have been recommended as construction materials.
Level gauge. ANF Manufacturers suggest the use of a magnetic-type level gauge,
such as a Fischer & Porter Model 13 C 2265W Liquid “ Levelrator” with donut-type
ﬂoat.
An alternative means for monitoring storage-tank content is to set the tank on load
cells or strain gauges.
Filters. Where the critical nature of the process has warranted, cartridge-type ﬁlters
in the storage tank-to-process line have been recommended. Two such ﬁlters are
normally mounted in parallel to permit replacing the cartridge in one line whilediverting the acid ﬂow through the other. Construction materials used in fabricating theﬁlters are the same or similar to those described above for other auxiliary equipment.HANDLING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND SAFETY 681
Poly-propylene can be used as ﬁlter material for AHF alone if the liquid temperature
remains below 200◦F.
When a fouled ﬁlter is removed for replacement, it should be promptly ﬂushed withwater, neutralized with a solution of soda ash, and rinsed before discard.
Personal safety
Liquid AHF causes immediate and serious burns to any part of the body on contact.
Dilute solutions of hydroﬂuoric acid often do not cause an immediate burning sensa-
tion where they came in contact with skin. Several hours may pass before the solutionpenetrates the skin sufﬁciently to cause redness or a burning sensation.
Wearing clothing which may have absorbed small amounts of hydroﬂuoric acid (such
as leather shoes or gloves) can result in painful delayed effects similar to those causedby dilute acid solutions.
Hydroﬂuoric acid vapor causes skin irritation and inﬂammation of the mucous mem-
branes; the burns become apparent a few hours after exposure. Inhaling the vapor inhigh concentrations may cause lung damage (pulmonary edema).
The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists recommends a
Threshold Limit Value of 3 parts (by volume) AHF vapor (hydrogen ﬂuoride) permillion parts air. This value refers to a time weighted concentration for a seven or 8 hrworkday and 40-hr work week.
The 3 ppm ﬁgure is based on both experimental and occupational evidence; however,"
"nosebleeds and sinus troubles have reportedly occurred among metal workers exposedto even lower concentrations of a ﬂuoride or ﬂuorine in air. Therefore, for protectionagainst acute irritation, 3 ppm should be considered a ceiling limit.
Anyone who knows or even suspects he has come in contact with hydroﬂuoric acid
should immediately seek ﬁrst aid.
In the event of an accident, the plant nurse or physician should be called as soon as
possible; however, all plant supervisors should be aware of ﬁrst aid procedures forHF burns. All affected persons should be referred to a physician even when the injuryseems slight.
The amines used in gas treating
Amine solvents are used in petroleum and natural gas reﬁning to remove hydro-
gen sulﬁde from the various streams. In petroleum reﬁning, the monoethanolamine682 CHAPTER 15

(MEA) compound of the homologue is the more common in the treating processes.
Diethanolamine (DEA) however is a close second with proprietary compounds ofamine such as Sulﬁnol and ADIP following closely in usage. All of these amineshowever are similar in respect to their hazard in the reﬁning operation, their handlingand their effect on people’ s health. For the purpose of this work, only MEA willbe considered here. However as a point of reference Table 15.2 gives the physicalproperties of those amines used in petroleum reﬁning (see also Chapter 10). MEAis corrosive and a combustible liquid and requires special handling and personnelprotection considerations.
Personal safety
All Amines are injurious to personnel. The effects of exposure to MEA are as follows:
Target organs: Kidneys, central nervous system, liver.
Potential health effects
The eyes: MEA causes severe eye irritation and burning.
The skin: May be absorbed through the skin in harmful amounts. Causes moderate
skin irritation.
Ingestion: Causes gastrointestinal tract burns.
Inhalation: Inhalation of high concentrations may cause central nervous system ef-
fects. This is characterized by headaches, dizziness, unconsciousness, and coma.Also causes respiratory tract irritation.
Chronic: May cause liver and kidney damage.
Safe handling
MEA is transported by road or rail tanker in its concentrated form. It is transferred in
the normal way to an onsite storage bullet, which is blanketed by an inert gas. MEA isHANDLING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND SAFETY 683
degraded on exposure to air. The use of this, and other enthanolamines, in the reﬁnery
processes is in a dilute form. This dilution and its onsite storage is very often in asuitably constructed pit usually in the proximity of the user plant. In some cases, acone roof tank may be used for onsite storage. In all cases, though, the product mustbe kept free from exposure to air by inert gas blanketing. The dilution of MEA foruse in the reﬁnery process is between 15 and 20 wt%. The water for this dilution isusually treated boiler feed water, which is essentially free of impurities.
Vessels and piping in the process in which the amine is used should be of a suitable
grade of carbon steel. The temperatures at which the amine is exposed to is below300
◦F throughout the process. Personnel likely to be exposed to the amine must
wear protective clothing, including eye pieces. As in the case of handling AHF , theminimum protection for operating and maintenance personnel should be:
rCoveralls, with sleeves to the wrist
rChemical safety goggles
rHard hat
rGauntlets (polyvinyl chloride)
rStandard safety footwear
In addition to the standard, protective clothing listed certain operating and mainte-nance work requires the use of a respirator. Such an instance would be in the changingof the amine ﬁlter (see Chapter 10) cartridge. Although the ﬁlter will have been steamcleaned prior to opening the ﬁlter vessel respiratory protection is essential until thepresence of amine and H
2S is certiﬁed to be absent. The certiﬁcation is established
by gas testing and the special processes to determine the absence of the sulﬁde (LeadAcetate test).
Equipment and piping
As is the case with all alkaline substances Amines cause stress corrosion. Conse-
quently, all vessels and piping (welds) are stress relieved. Valves and piping are incarbon steel as are pumps and heat exchanger tubes.
Caustic soda
Caustic soda solution is used in oil reﬁning mostly for the absorption of hydrogen"
"sulﬁde or light mercaptans from light petroleum products from LPG thro the Kerosenecut. Very often the compound is delivered to the reﬁnery in a strong aqueous solutionto be further diluted on site to the strength required by a speciﬁc process. Sodiumhydroxide in a solution is a white, odorless, non-volatile solution. It will not burn684 CHAPTER 15
but it is highly reactive. It can react violently with water and numerous commonly
encountered materials, generating enough heat to ignite nearby combustible materials.Contact with many organic and inorganic chemicals may cause ﬁre or explosion.Reaction with metals releases ﬂammable hydrogen gas.
Sodium hydroxide is produced mainly in three forms: 50% and 73% aqueous solutions,
and anhydrous sodium hydroxide in the form of solid cakes, ﬂakes or beads. Themajor impurities include sodium chloride, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfate, sodiumchlorate, potassium, and heavy metals such as iron and nickel.

glycerol
pH value: 12 (0.05% solution); 13 (0.5% solution);

Hazards associated with handling sodium hydroxide
Skin. Sodium hydroxide is extremely corrosive and is capable of causing severe burns
with deep ulceration and permanent scarring. It can penetrate to deeper layers of skin
and corrosion will continue until removed. The severity of injury depends on theconcentration of the solution and the duration of exposure. Burns may not be im-mediately painful; onset of pain may be delayed minutes to hours. Several humanstudies and case reports describe the corrosive effects of sodium hydroxide. A 4%solution of sodium hydroxide, applied to a volunteer’ s arm for 15–180 min, causeddamage which progressed from destruction of cells of the hard outer layer of the skinwithin 15 min to total destruction of all layers of the skin in 60 min. Solutions asweak as 0.12% have damaged healthy skin within 1 hr. Sodium hydroxide dissolvedthe hair and caused reversible baldness and scalp burns when a concentrated solu-tion (pH 13.5) dripped onto a worker’ s head and treatment was delayed for severalhours.
Eyes. Sodium hydroxide is extremely corrosive. The severity of injury increases with
the concentration of the solution, the duration of exposure, and the speed of penetration
into the eye. Damage can range from severe irritation and mild scarring to blistering,HANDLING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND SAFETY 685
disintegration, ulceration, severe scarring, and clouding. Conditions which affect
vision such as glaucoma and cataracts are possible late developments. In severe cases,there is progressive ulceration and clouding of eye tissue which may lead to permanentblindness.
Inhalation. A worker, exposed for 2 hr daily over 20 years to mists from boiling a
solution of sodium hydroxide in two large containers in a small room with inadequate
ventilation, developed severe obstructive airway disease. It was concluded that themassive and prolonged exposure induced irritation and burns to the respiratory systemeventually leading to the disease. It was noted that chronic exposure had not previouslybeen reported, probably since the strong and immediate irritation would normally deterworkers from further exposure. Actual exposures to sodium hydroxide aerosols werenot measured and it could not deﬁnitely exclude late onset asthma as a cause of theman’ s condition.
A report of workers exposed to sodium hydroxide aerosol for at least 16 months, was
confounded by the presence of high concentrations of Stoddard solvent and othersolvent vapors, as well as other chemicals.
There was no trend of increased mortality in relation to duration (up to 30 years)
or intensity of exposure (0.5–1.5 mg/m
3) among 291 workers exposed to sodium
hydroxide dust during the production of ﬂakes or beads of concentrated sodium hy-droxide from chlorine cell efﬂuent. This study is limited by the small populationsize.
Ingestion. There are no reported cases of industrial workers ingesting sodium hy-
droxide solutions. Non-occupational ingestion has produced severe corrosive burns
to the esophageal tissue, which has in some cases progressed to stricture formation.Should ingestion occur, severe pain; burning of the mouth, throat, and esophagus;vomiting; diarrhea; collapse, and possible death may result.
Long term effects. Sodium hydroxide has been implicated as a cause of cancer of the
esophagus in individuals who have ingested it. The cancer may develop 12–42 years"
"after the ingestion incident. Similar cancers have been observed at the sites of severethermal burns. These cancers may be due to tissue destruction and scar formationrather than the sodium hydroxide itself.
A case-control study reported an association between renal cancer and history of
employment in the cell maintenance area of chlorine production. The major exposuresin this work were presumed to be to asbestos and sodium hydroxide. An associationwas made between renal cancer and sodium hydroxide exposure. This study is limited686 CHAPTER 15
by factors such as small numbers of exposed workers, multiple exposures, reliance
on work histories and is not considered sufﬁciently reliable.
Skin. Owing to its corrosive nature, repeated or prolonged skin contact would be
expected to cause drying, cracking, and inﬂammation of the skin (dermatitis).First aid and personal safety
Contact with the skin. Avoid direct contact with this chemical. Wear chemical resis-
tant protective clothing, if necessary. As quickly as possible, remove contaminated
clothing, shoes, and leather goods (e.g., watchbands, belts). Flush contaminated areawith lukewarm, gently ﬂowing water for at least 60 min, by the clock. DO NOTINTERRUPT FLUSHING. If necessary, keep emergency vehicle waiting. Transportvictim to an emergency care facility immediately. Discard contaminated clothing,shoes, and leather goods.
Contact with the eyes. Avoid direct contact. Wear chemical resistant gloves, if neces-
sary. Quickly and gently blot or brush away excess chemical. Immediately ﬂush the
contaminated eye(s) with lukewarm, gently ﬂowing water for at least 60 min, by theclock, while holding the eyelid(s) open. Neutral saline solution may be used as soonas it is available. DO NOT INTERRUPT FLUSHING. If necessary, keep emergencyvehicle waiting. Take care not to rinse contaminated water into the unaffected eye oronto the face. Quickly transport victim to an emergency care facility.
Suffering from inhalation. Avoid direct contact. Wear chemical resistant gloves, if
necessary. Quickly and gently blot or brush away excess chemical. Immediately ﬂush
the contaminated eye(s) with lukewarm, gently ﬂowing water for at least 60 min, by theclock, while holding the eyelid(s) open. Neutral saline solution may be used as soonas it is available. DO NOT INTERRUPT FLUSHING. If necessary, keep emergencyvehicle waiting. Take care not to rinse contaminated water into the unaffected eye oronto the face. Quickly transport victim to an emergency care facility.
Ingestion. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING! Give large quantities of water or milk
if available. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Get medical
attention immediately.
Protective clothing
Personal respirators (NIOSH Approved). If the exposure limit is exceeded and engi-
neering controls are not feasible, a half-face piece particulate respirator (NIOSH type
N95 or better ﬁlters) may be worn for up to 10 times the exposure limit or the max-imum use concentration speciﬁed by the appropriate regulatory agency or respiratorHANDLING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND SAFETY 687
supplier, whichever is lowest. A full-face piece particulate respirator (NIOSH type
N100 ﬁlters) may be worn up to 50 times the exposure limit, or the maximum useconcentration speciﬁed by the appropriate regulatory agency, or respirator supplier,whichever is lowest. If oil particles (e.g., lubricants, cutting ﬂuids, glycerin, etc.) arepresent, use a NIOSH type R or P ﬁlter. For emergencies or instances where theexposure levels are not known, use a full-face piece positive-pressure, air-suppliedrespirator. WARNING: Air-purifying respirators do not protect workers in oxygen-deﬁcient atmospheres.
Skin Protection. Wear impervious protective clothing, including boots, gloves, lab
coat, apron or coveralls, as appropriate, to prevent skin contact.Eye protection. Use chemical safety goggles and/or a full face shield where splashing
is possible. Maintain eye wash fountain and quick-drench facilities in work area.Materials of construction
Carbon steel can be used throughout at moderate temperatures. At temperatures in
excess of 350
◦F nickel or nickel alloy is recommended. All carbon steel piping,
ﬂanges, welds, and vessel must be stress relieved. Caustic soda solution also attacksglass and dissolves it to some extent. As caustic soda is used in cleaning processplants during commissioning site, glasses and level gauges are removed and replacedwith silica ones for this cleaning phase of the commissioning.
Furfural
Furfural is used in petroleum reﬁning for the production of lube oils. It is a solvent in
the extraction of undesirable compounds such as naphthenes and aromatics from lubeoil stocks to improve the color of the lube oil product (see Chapter 12). Furfural orfurfuraldehyde, C
4H3OCHO, is a viscous, colorless liquid that has a pleasant aromatic
odor; which upon exposure to air it turns dark brown or black. It boils at about 160◦C. It"
"is commonly used as a solvent; it is soluble in ethanol and ether and somewhat solublein water. Furfural is the aldehyde of pyromucic acid; it has properties similar to thoseof benzaldehyde. A derivative of furan, it is prepared commercially by dehydrationof pentose sugars obtained from cornstalks and corncobs, husks of oat and peanut,and other waste products. It is used in the manufacture of pesticides, phenolfurfuralresins, and tetrahydrofuran. Tetrahydrofuran is used as a commercial solvent and isconverted in starting materials for the preparation of nylon. Its chemical propertiesare as follows:688 CHAPTER 15
Appearance: Colorless to yellowish liquid.
Odor: Almond odor.
Solubility: 8 gm/100 gm water @ 70◦F.
Speciﬁc gravity: 1.16 @ 77◦F
% V olatiles by volume @ 70◦F: 100
Boiling point: 324◦F
Melting point: –38◦F
Vapor density (Air =1): 3.3
Vapor pressure (mm Hg): 1 @ 64◦F
Hazards associated with handling furfural
Inhalation. Causes irritation to the mucous membranes and upper respiratory tract.
Symptoms may include sore throat, labored breathing, and headache. Higher concen-
trations act on the central nervous system and may cause lung congestion. Inhalationmay be fatal.
Ingestion. Highly toxic. May cause gastrointestinal disorders. Can cause nerve de-
pression and severe headache. May be fatal. Other effects are not well known.
Skin contact. Irritant to skin. May cause dermatitis and possibly eczema, allergic
sensitization, and photosensitization. May be absorbed through the skin with possible
systemic effects.
Eye contact. Vapors irritate the eyes, causing tearing, itching, and redness. Splashes
may cause severe irritation or eye damage.Chronic exposure. Can cause numbness of the tongue, loss of sense of taste, headache.
Other effects are not well-known.
Aggravation of pre-existing conditions. Persons with pre-existing skin disorders or
eye problems, or impaired liver, kidney or respiratory function may be more suscep-
tible to the effects of the substance.
First aid and personal safety
Inhalation. Remove to fresh air. If not breathing, give artiﬁcial respiration. If breath-
ing is difﬁcult, give oxygen. Get medical attention immediately.
Ingestion. If swallowed, give large quantities of water to drink and get medical atten-
tion immediately. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person.HANDLING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND SAFETY 689
Skin contact. Immediately ﬂush skin with plenty of soap and water for at least 15 min
while removing contaminated clothing and shoes. Get medical attention, immediately.
Wash clothing before reuse. Thoroughly clean shoes before reuse.
Eye contact. Immediately ﬂush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 min, lifting
lower and upper eyelids occasionally. Get medical attention immediately.Protective clothing and equipment
Airborne exposure limits. Between 2 and 5 ppm.
V entilation system. A system of local and/or general exhaust is recommended to keep
employee exposures below the Airborne Exposure Limits. Local exhaust ventilation
is generally preferred because it can control the emissions of the contaminant atits source, preventing dispersion of it into the general work area. Please refer to theACGIH document, Industrial V entilation, A Manual of Recommended Practices, most
recent edition, for details.
Personal respirators (NIOSH approved). If the exposure limit is exceeded, a full-face
piece respirator with organic vapor cartridge may be worn up to 50 times the exposure
limit or the maximum use concentration speciﬁed by the appropriate regulatory agencyor respirator supplier, whichever is lowest. For emergencies or instances where theexposure levels are not known, use a full-face piece positive-pressure, air-suppliedrespirator. WARNING: Air purifying respirators do not protect workers in oxygen-deﬁcient atmospheres.
Skin protection. Wear impervious protective clothing, including boots, gloves, lab
coat, apron or coveralls, as appropriate, to prevent skin contact.Eye protection. Use chemical safety goggles and/or a full face shield where splashing
is possible. Maintain eye wash fountain and quick-drench facilities in work area.

Materials of construction and storageThere are no speciﬁc materials of construction, a suitable grade of carbon steel is
adequate. Storage and handling of furfural must exclude air. Furfural polymerizesreadily on exposure to air. In reﬁnery practices, start up of furfural extraction plantsusually requires that the equipment which handles furfural be ﬁrst ﬁlled with eitherthe lube oil feed or a suitable middle distillate to eliminate air.
Hydrogen sulﬁde H
2S
Hydrogen sulﬁde in a reﬁnery is usually formed during the desulfurizing processes
used to sweeten distillate product streams. Hydrogen sulﬁde (H 2S) is a colorless,
extremely poisonous gas that has a very disagreeable odor, much like that of rotteneggs. It is slightly soluble in water and is soluble in carbon disulﬁde. Dissolved inwater, it forms a very weak dibasic acid. Hydrogen sulﬁde is ﬂammable, and in excessair it burns to form sulfur dioxide and water, where not enough oxygen is present,it forms elemental sulfur and water. It may be made by reacting hydrogen gas withmolten sulfur or with sulfur vapors, or by treating a metal sulﬁde (e.g., ferrous sulﬁde,FeS) with an acid. Hydrogen sulﬁde reacts with most metal ions to form sulﬁdes; thesulﬁdes of some metals are insoluble in water and have characteristic colors that help toidentify the metal during chemical analysis. Hydrogen sulﬁde also reacts directly withsilver metal, forming a dull, gray-black tarnish of silver sulﬁde (Ag
2S). One method
of detecting small concentrations of hydrogen sulﬁde is to expose it to a ﬁlter paperimpregnated with lead acetate. The paper turns black (due to the precipitation of leadsulﬁde. The degree of H
2S concentration is measured by the shade of ‘ Blackness’of
the lead acetate paper compared with standard colors. The chemical data on hydrogensulﬁde is given in Table 15.3.HANDLING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND SAFETY 691

The hazards and toxicity of hydrogen sulﬁde
Table 15.4 indicates the toxicity of hydrogen sulﬁde.At 1 ppm, most people can smell the gas. A strong smell does not necessarily mean
a high concentration and a slight smell does not mean a low concentration. A personcould work in a 10 ppm concentration of H
2S for 8 hr. If the concentration exceeds
10 ppm for a short period of time, then the time must be reduced.
A concentration of 15 ppm can be tolerated for a period of time not exceeding 15
min. There can be no more than 4 exposures of 15 ppm in an 8 hr shift with 1 hr

between exposures. If the concentration of H 2S exceeds 20 ppm, a worker must wear
approved breathing apparatus. If the concentration is not known, a worker must wear
breathing apparatus until the concentration is determined.
If exposed to a concentration of 100 ppm (1/100 of 1%), the sense of smell will be
lost or become ineffective within 2–15 min. The H 2S might cause a burning sensation
to the eyes, throat, and lungs, and could cause headache or nausea.
A 200 ppm concentration will cause immediate loss of smell and a burning sensation
in the eyes, throat, nose, and lungs. (The hydrogen sulﬁde combines with alkali inbody ﬂuids to form caustic sodium sulﬁde.)
At a concentration of 500 ppm, the victim will appear to be intoxicated, and will
lose his sense of balance and reasoning. In this state, the victim may attempt tocontinue with the job he was doing when he encountered the gas. For this reason,a person must know the people he works with, and be able to detect any unusual"
"behavior of a coworker. Obviously, persons under the inﬂuence of alcohol, or anyother mind-altering drugs, should never be allowed in an area which may contain sourgas. A victim must be watched very closely and may require resuscitation. A victimshould be taken for medical attention and not allowed to return to work for at least8h r .
At 700 ppm, the victim will be rendered unconscious very quickly, and may develop
seizures similar to those caused by epilepsy. Loss of bladder and bowel control canbe expected. Breathing will stop, and death will result, if not rescued and resuscitatedpromptly. At a concentration of 1,000 ppm (1/10 of 1%) the victim will be ren-dered unconscious immediately. THE VICTIM WILL NOT BEGIN BREATHINGVOLUNTARIL Y IF BROUGHT TO FRESH AIR. ARTIFICIAL RESUSCITATIONMUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN THREE MINUTES OF EXPOSURE TO HY -DROGEN SULPHIDE!
Protective clothing and personal safety
Much of the personal protection regarding hydrogen sulﬁde has been discussed in
item 1 above. Essentially when working in an area which is or may be exposed tohydrogen sulﬁde an appropriate respirator must be at hand if not actually worn. Inconﬁned areas such as enclosed compressor or pump houses which handle sour gas orliquids constant monitoring for H
2S concentration in the atmosphere must be made.
Preferably this will be accomplished by an automatic air analyzer with an alarmattachment. Failing this a routine analysis using a lead acetate paper should be made.In addition all such buildings should always be properly vented using an exhausterfan system.HANDLING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND SAFETY 693
Materials of construction in H 2S service
Atmospheres containing hydrogen sulﬁde and completely or almost free of oxygen
give rise to rapid corrosion of unalloyed steel by forming a sulﬁde ﬁlm on its surface.The corrosion rate in hydrogen/hydrogen sulﬁde increases as the content of hydrogensulﬁde increases up to about 5 vol%, while increases beyond that point generally onlyhave a slight effect on the corrosion rate. Steels alloyed with chromium and aluminumhave improved resistance to hydrogen sulﬁde, while nickel has no deleterious effect.
Moist and aqueous solution of hydrogen sulﬁde cause some minor pitting in unalloyed
steel and there is a risk of stress corrosion. This pitting corrosion is about 1 mm/year.This rate can be considerably reduced to about 0.1%/year using an alloyed steel of18% chrome and 9% nickel. Vessels and piping should all be stress relieved.
Methyl ethyl ketone
Methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) is used in oil reﬁning for the removal of wax from lube oil
stock (see Chapter 12). Methyl ethyl ketone is a colorless liquid with a sweet/sharp,fragrant, acetone-like odor. It is extremely ﬂammable in both the liquid and vaporphase. The vapor is heavier than air and may spread long distances and distant ignitionand ﬂashback are possible. MEK is highly volatile. Its chemical data is given inTable 15.5. MEK has a boiling point of 176
◦F and a vapor pressure of 3 ins Hg at 68◦F.
Hazards associated with MEK
Inhalation. Causes irritation to the nose and throat. Concentrations above 200 ppm
may cause headache, dizziness, nausea, shortness of breath, and vomiting. Higher
concentrations may cause central nervous system depression and unconsciousness.
Ingestion. May produce abdominal pain, nausea. Aspiration into lungs can produce
severe lung damage and is a medical emergency. Other symptoms expected to parallel
inhalation.

15.2 Fire prevention and ﬁre ﬁghting
Fire prevention and ﬁre protection is a paramount requisite in the operation of any
hydrocarbon facility. It is more important perhaps in oil reﬁning than any other relatedfacility because of the relative size of most reﬁneries compared with petrochemicalor chemical facilities. Reﬁnery prevention and protection begins at the early stagesof the reﬁnery design, and engineering. This section of the chapter begins with thereﬁnery company’ s development of the design and engineering speciﬁcation, which isthe document that instructs the Engineering and Construction company in details ofthe reﬁnery standards that are to be implemented in the building of the reﬁnery. Thissection begins with a list of the items usually contained in the design speciﬁcation.It continues with more details of those items that pertain to ﬁre prevention and ﬁreﬁghting.
The design speciﬁcation
Client companies each have their speciﬁc design speciﬁcation in terms of format and
indeed details of the various speciﬁcations. However most design speciﬁcations willcontain the following subject as a minimum.
The duty speciﬁcation. This is of interest to the design process and mechanical engi-
neer. It states exactly what facilities are to be built and the duty of each item in terms"
"of throughput and in some cases composition of the various streams. It will also givespeciﬁc detail of the local meteorological data and the parameters to be consideredin economic decisions. The duty speciﬁcation will include the products required andthe composition of the products. It will also give full details of utilities required oravailable for the process. In cases of ‘ grass roots’facilities the duty speciﬁcation willcover off sites such as tankage, blending, loading, and unloading facilities, etc.
Mechanical speciﬁcation. This deals with the requirement and standards (including
the codes to be used) the client requires for the equipment that will be installed. The
narrative speciﬁcations that the mechanical engineer will produce based on this, willHANDLING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND SAFETY 697
form part of the package to be used for procuring these items of equipment. These
equipment items will be at least the following:
rPumps
rCompressors and Turbines
rHeat Exchangers (including Air coolers, double pipe, etc.)
rFired Heaters
rOther miscellaneous equipment such as ejectors, blenders, and the like
The electrical and instrument speciﬁcation. This part will set the standards to be used
for all electrical equipment, and the bulk materials associated with the equipment. Itwill deal with the ‘ Area Classiﬁcation Code’ which sets the parameters for equipmentin terms of ﬁre prooﬁng (i.e., whether the item is to be spark proof, etc.) that will belocated in the various areas of the reﬁnery. For instrumentation it speciﬁes the typeof instruments to be used and the basic control and measuring systems to be used.
Piping and layout speciﬁcation. This is usually the largest section of a design speci-
ﬁcation. It will detail the piping codes to be used and the material break points. It will
proceed to establish the criteria for equipment and tankage layout with respect to:
rMaintenance accessibility
rFire prevention (e.g., distance of ﬁred heaters from other equipment)
rTank area layout and size of tank bunds
rDegree of ﬁre protection piping for plant units and tanks
rUnder ground piping corrosion protection, etc.
Other sections of the design speciﬁcation. These include detail requirements for ves-
sels, civil, and structural equipment and associated materials.
Fire prevention with respect to equipment design and operation
Fired heaters. Design of ﬁred heaters must incorporate snufﬁng steam facilities for
the ﬁre box. With respect to the maintenance and operation of the heater the following
points should be included into operating procedures:
1. Implement a formal, regularly scheduled preventive maintenance program for
burners and the clean-up of any refractory debris to prevent ﬂame impingement.
2. Introduce a mechanism to monitor and record, more accurately and thoroughly,
tube skin temperature to prevent hot spots.
3. Implement a thorough and complete procedure to deal with hot spots once detected
and reported. This includes the recording of descriptions and locations of any
suspected hot spot detected in a visual inspection.698 CHAPTER 15
4. Introduce an accurate method to determine the impact on tube life once a hot spot
is detected.
5. The reﬁnery personnel should be trained to recognize and respond to the changes
in metallurgical properties and characteristics demonstrated by different material
in the furnaces that are subjected to high temperature and pressure. Documentationto be updated to reﬂect this information.
Pressure vessels. These include towers, horizontal and vertical process vessels all of
which must be protected properly with pressure relieving devices (see Chapter 13for pressure relief facilities). In the design of vessels the correct wall thickness isbased on the API and ASME codes covering the design temperatures and pressures.Fireprooﬁng of vertical vessel skirts and horizontal vessel supports must be speciﬁed.In the operation and maintenance of vessels the following items must be included asstandard procedures:
rVessel alarms must be recognized and acted upon.
rAction must be taken immediately when excessively high temperatures and high orlow liquid levels are observed.
rIn the case of a ﬁre on the unit or adjacent unit the towers must be shut downaccording to the plant’ s emergency shut down procedures.
rIn the event of an emergency shut down the vessel must be purged free of hydro-carbons either by steam or inert gas.
rNo entry or work must be done on the vessel before it is certiﬁed ‘ Gas Free’ .
rAll vessels must be inspected before re commissioning after a shut down. Theinspection must ensure that all ﬂanges are secure and the correct gaskets have beenproperly installed.
rAll instruments and relief systems on the vessels must be checked and re-calibratedon every scheduled or unscheduled shut down of the plant.
rAll vessels must be pressure tested before commissioning and after any work hasbeen completed on them."
"rAll drains and vents on the vessel must be checked during scheduled plant‘ turnaround’or un scheduled shut down before re commissioning the vessel.
Heat exchangers and coolers. Shell and tube heat exchangers are designed and fabri-
cated to ASME and TEMA codes. Their shell design follows closely to that of vesselswith respect to design temperatures and pressures. The thickness of tubes and tubesheets are also calculated using the ASME code. In the case of air coolers the tubesheets and tubes are also calculated to ASME codes as are the inlet and outlet mani-folds. Air coolers tubes are usually ﬁnned to enhance the heat exchanger properties ofthe units. The operation and maintenance of shell and tube exchangers follow manyof those conditions stated for vessels with respect to ﬁre (or explosion) prevention.In the case of air coolers however some different rules and procedures apply. Forexample a number of air coolers in a reﬁnery are installed above an elevated pipeHANDLING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND SAFETY 699
rack. The pipe rack often runs through the center of a process plant, that is there will
be equipment on both sides of the rack. It is usual for the pipe rack structure to beencased in a ﬁre proof concrete as a ﬁre prevention measure. This ﬁreprooﬁng shouldextend upwards to cover the air cooler structures as well. Fire water and foam spraysshould be installed above the tube nests such as to snuff out any outbreak of tube leaksand subsequent ﬁres.
Rotary equipment. This group includes all pumps, and compressors. Next to ﬁred
heaters the compressor units, which may include gas driven turbine or turbo ex-
panders, are the items most vulnerable as ﬁre hazards. The reason in this case is thehigh pressures of the gas they handle, and this is more so in those units handlinghydrogen. All reciprocal compressors must have pressure relief facilities on the com-pressor discharge. Most also have an emergency shut down system in the case ofhigh discharge pressure. Centrifugal compressors and their drivers require a moresophisticated emergency shut down procedures however. Here critical condition canarise by poor suction conditions as well as the high-pressure discharge. All centrifugalcompressors therefore require protection against ‘ Surge’(or ‘ Pumping’ ) condition.
For example this condition can occur when the compressor suction pressure is so lowthat the unit cannot pull any of the feed gas into its impellers. Severe vibration ofthe unit follows which, in extreme cases, will cause considerable structural damageto the unit and even an explosion and ﬁre. Most modern day units do have anti surgedevices, which if properly maintained will close the unit down long before any severedamage.
Pumps, even those handling high-pressure liqueﬁed petroleum gases are less haz-
ardous. Overheating due to defective seals or packing is the more common hazardthat can cause a ﬁre. Pump cavitating due to NPSH problems being a much lessersecond hazard.
In most present day reﬁneries rotary equipment is installed in the open or in an area
which has only a roof as a cover. This helps a great deal to ﬁght any rotary equipmentﬁre. Usually the area containing rotary equipment will have both ﬁre water and foamfacilities installed. Close monitoring of the rotary equipment during operation andregular maintenance of the items are essential for the prevention of ﬁres from thesesources.
Tanks and the tank farm. Tank ﬁres are probably the worse type of ﬁre in a reﬁnery.
This is because tanks hold a high inventory of hydrocarbons. The one thing that lowers
the degree of hazard in the tank farm is that there is usually no direct source of ignition.There are no ﬁred heaters or large compressor units present in tank farms as a rule.Fires can occur however from accidents remote from the area such as a ﬁre on a jetty ora ship nearby. There was a tank farm ﬁre in New Y ork during February 2003, that wascaused by an explosion aboard a barge unloading gasoline at a nearby jetty. Large fuel700 CHAPTER 15
oil tanks on shore were set ablaze by hot debris from the explosion. Another source
of ﬁre is an explosion in a product loading station while loading a light product suchas gasoline. These explosions are usually caused by static electricity. Most petroleumcompanies do have strict procedure in place to prevent such occurrences, but accidentsdo happen from time to time.
Middle distillates and fuel oil tanks present the most difﬁcult ﬁres to ﬁght and ex-"
"tinguish. The large inventory of these tanks and their low volatility but high heatingvalue can negate for quite a time even using the most up to date foam extinguishingtechniques once the ﬁre has really established itself. The major effort then is to keepadjacent tanks cool by extensive water spray. Fires on tanks storing lighter liquidproducts are a little easier to combat. Foam is used to smother the oil inventory. Asthese light products are stored in ﬂoating roof tanks, it provides the means to builda depth of foam on the roof itself directly on the surface of the liquid if the roof hasbeen damaged by an earlier explosion. Fire water sprays are installed on LPG spheresand bullets. In almost every case the initial ﬁre on LPG tankage causes an explosion.The material remaining can be snuffed out by foam and again the main purpose of theﬁre ﬁghting is to activate the ﬁre water sprays on adjacent tanks to keep them cool.Incidentally all reﬁneries these days have in place ﬁre water and foam spray rings onall storage tanks (see Chapter 13). Water on its own should only be used to keep thetank cool from adjacent ﬁre sources. The danger of using water alone to extinguish aﬁre is that it may cause the ﬁre to spread by the hydrocarbon continuing to burn onthe surface of the water stream ﬂowing from the tank area.
The design of storage tanks and their installation shall comply with the local Fire
Regulations. In general crude oil and petroleum products with a ﬂash point of <130
◦F
shall be stored in ﬂoating roof tanks, or in the case of LPG in bullets or spheres. Middledistillates and heavier shall be stored in cone roof tanks. Storage tanks, both ﬂoatingroof or cone roof, shall be installed on concrete pads which will be piled if required.The space between tanks shall not be less than 10 ft (or according to local regulations).The tank area shall be dyked to hold at least 110% of a single tank inventory. Thisdyked or bunded area shall contain adequate drainage leading to the API separator orholding pond. LPG storage generally does not require a dyked area but both bulletsand spheres shall be installed with proper ﬁreproofed support structures.
Jetty and on shore loading stations. One of the biggest ﬁre hazards in areas of loading
rail/road cars and ship loading is ﬁre by spark caused by static electricity. The proper
earthing of the items being loaded is essential in preventing this ﬁre hazard. Thesame applies to the unloading of hydrocarbons such as crude oil feed or other productstreams transferred from other reﬁneries or depots. In small reﬁnery installations thejetty facilities and the on shore loading islands are protected by an extension of theoff sites ﬁre main and foam systems. In larger reﬁneries the jetty may have its ownﬁre main using sea water as the main water medium.HANDLING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND SAFETY 701

 To All Monitors Break Tank
 Circ Pump
Figure 15.1. Schematic ﬁre main system.
The ﬁre main
Fire mains are usually designed as a pressurized circulating water system with an at-
mospheric break tank. A schematic sketch of such a system is given as Figure 15.1. Theﬁre main is maintained at a pressure of around 100 psig by the circulating pump. Thispump is automatically switched on or off to maintain the line pressure when monitorsare opened to deliver the water to ﬁre sources or foam system or for any other appli-cation for which they are opened to atmosphere. The pump is usually electric motordriven with a spare which is usually driven by a diesel motor or steam turbine. The sparepump drive is automatically activated on electrical failure and the inability of the nor-mal ﬁre circulating pump to maintain line pressure. Make up water to the break tank ismaintained under break tank level control from the reﬁnery’ s fresh (or salt water) main.
On smaller reﬁnery facilities and smaller systems, such as a jetty ﬁre main, the system
m a yb e‘ dead ended’ . That is the ﬁre water pump would be used only to maintain the
ﬁre main pressure. The water would not be circulated to a break tank. A water sourcetank or pit would be used as the ﬁre water source reservoir. In the case of the jettyﬁre main usually sea water is used and this would be delivered from a suitable seabedpit by a vertical pump. Again an electric motor driver would be used for the normalpump with usually a steam turbine driver for the spare pump.
Fire foam and foam systems
Fire ﬁghting foam is simply a stable mass of small, air-ﬁlled bubbles with a lower
density than oil, gasoline, or water. The foam is made up of three ingredients:
rWater;
rA foam concentrate; and
rAir
The water is mixed with the concentrate (proportioned) to form a foam solution. Thissolution is then mixed with air (aspirated) to produce the foam which is very ﬂuidand ﬂows readily over liquid surfaces.702 CHAPTER 15
Balanced pressure proportioning is the most common method used for foam system"
"applications. The foam concentrate pressure is balanced with the water pressure at theproportioner inlets allowing the proper amount of foam concentrate to be metered intothe water stream. With an aspirating discharge device, foam solution passes throughan oriﬁce, past air inlets, and into an expansion area to produce an expanded foam.With non-aspirating devices, foam solution passes through the oriﬁce and dischargeoutlet where it mixes with air en route to the ﬁre.
Fire ﬁghting foam is used in a variety of applications to extinguish ﬂammable and
combustible liquid ﬁres, to control the release of ﬂammable vapors and to cool fuelsand sources of ignition. Typical foam applications include:
rLoading racks
rReﬁneries
rPumping stations
rPower plants
rAirports
rHeliports
rMarine applications
rManufacturing plants
rStorage tanks
rChemical plants
rFlammable liquid storage
rOffshore platforms
rAircraft hangars
rCrash rescue vehicles
rMining facilities
rWarehouses
rHazardous material spill control.
Fire ﬁghting foam agents suppress ﬁre by separating the fuel from the air (oxygen).Depending upon the type of foam agent, this is done in several ways:
rFoam blankets the fuel surface, smothering the ﬁre and separating the ﬂames fromthe fuel surface
rThe fuel is cooled by the water content of the foam
rThe foam blanket suppresses the release of ﬂammable vapors that can mix withair
A ﬁlm forming foam (AFFF) agent forms an aqueous ﬁlm on the surface of ahydrocarbon fuel. An alcohol-resistant concentrate (ARC) will form a polymericmembrane on a polar solvent fuel. Essentially there are six general types of foamagents:HANDLING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND SAFETY 703
Class B ﬁre foams
Film-forming foamsFilm-forming foams (AFFF) are based on combinations of ﬂuorochemical surfactants,
hydrocarbon surfactants, and solvents. These agents require a very low energy inputto produce a high-quality foam. Consequently, they can be applied through a widevariety of foam delivery systems. This versatility makes AFFF an obvious choicefor airports, reﬁneries, manufacturing plants, municipal ﬁre departments, and anyother operation involving the transportation, processing, or handling of ﬂammableliquids. These Foam Forming agents are available as 1% and 3% freeze-protectedconcentrates.

has been added. ARCs are the most versatile of the foam agents in that they areeffective on ﬁres involving polar solvents like methanol as well as hydrocarbon fuelslike gasoline. When used on a polar solvent type fuel, the ARC concentrate forms apolymeric membrane which prevents destruction of the foam blanket. When used onhydrocarbon fuels, the ARC produces the same rugged aqueous ﬁlm as a standardAFFF agent. ARCs provide fast ﬂame knockdown and good burn back resistancewhen used on both types of fuels.
Protein Foam Concentrates
Protein foam concentrates are recommended for the extinguishment of ﬁres involving
hydrocarbons. They are based on hydrolyzed protein, stabilizers, and preservatives.Protein foams produce a stable mechanical foam with good expansion properties andexcellent burn back resistance characteristics. Protein foam concentrates are availablein 3% and 6% concentrations.
Fluoroprotein foam concentrates
Fluoroprotein foam concentrates are based on hydrolyzed protein, stabilizers, preser-
vatives, and synthetic ﬂuorocarbon surfactants. When compared to protein foams,ﬂuoroproteins provide better control and extinguishment, greater ﬂuidity, and supe-rior resistance to fuel contamination. Fluoroprotein foams are useful for hydrocarbonvapor suppression and have been recognized as very effective ﬁre suppressing agentsfor sub-surface injection into hydrocarbon fuel storage tanks. Fluoroprotein foam isavailable in a 3% concentrate.704 CHAPTER 15
High expansion foam concentrates
High expansion foam concentrates are based on combination of hydrocarbon surfac-
tants and solvents. They are used with foam generators for applying foam to largeareas in total ﬂooding and three-dimensional applications such as warehouses, shipcargo holds, and mine shafts. They are especially useful on fuels such as liqueﬁednatural gas (cryogenic fuels) for vapor dispersion and control. In certain concentra-tions, high expansion foams are effective on hydrocarbon spill ﬁres of most types andin conﬁned areas.
Class A ﬁre foamsClass A foams are typically formulated from a combination of specialty hydrocarbon"
"surfactants, stabilizers, inhibitors, and solvents. They reduce the surface tension ofwater for improved wetting and penetrating characteristics and create a clinging foamblanket that suppresses combustible vapors while cooling the fuel. Class A foamscan be applied using a variety of proportioning/discharge devices and have provento be highly effective for use in structural and forest ﬁreﬁghting, coal mines, tire,and rubber manufacturing, lumber mills, coal bunkers, paper warehouses, and otherhazards involving ordinary combustible materials. Please note that Class B foamsare acceptable for use on Class A ﬁres, however they are not designed for use onClass A ﬁres as such. The foam concentrate percentage refers to the amount ofconcentrate that is proportioned or pre-mixed with water to give the resulting foamsolutions.
Environmental impact and toxicity. Most foam concentrates are formulated to maxi-
mize performance and minimize environmental impact and human exposure hazards.
All concentrates are readily biodegradable— both in the natural environment and insewage treatment facilities. However, all foam agents should be metered into the fa-cility to prevent overloading the plant due to foam formation. They are not consideredskin irritants; however, prolonged contact may cause some dryness of the skin. Forthis reason, we recommend that areas of the skin which have come in contact withthe foam concentrate be ﬂushed with fresh water.
Shelf life. Shelf life is the length of time over which foam concentrates remain sta-
ble without signiﬁcant changes in performance characteristics. Many AFFF , high-
expansion and Class A foam concentrates— if stored in accordance with recommendedguidelines— have a normal shelf life of 20–25 years. Other foam agents— those whichare not totally synthetic— have a normal shelf life of 7–10 years.Chapter 16
Quality control of products in petroleum reﬁning
D.S.J. Jones
Introduction
This chapter is concerned mostly with the laboratory testing for the control of
petroleum products. It will be concerned with those tests that establish the qualityof reﬁnery streams and in some ﬁnished and saleable products. What is not coveredare those specialized tests such as Mass Spectrometry, motor road tests and the like.Where possible sketches of test apparatus are included. Most of these tests are per-formed in the reﬁnery laboratory, and generally follow the methods provided by therespective ASTM numbered tests.
The most common tests to check the quality of ﬁnished products cover the fol-
lowing:
rSpeciﬁc gravity
rASTM distillations
rPensky Marten closed cup ﬂash point
rKinematic viscosities
rOctane numbers
rSulfur content tests
rLPG weathering tests
rReid vapor pressure
rBromine number
The chapter begins with some details of typical product speciﬁcations. More discus-sion and description of modern day trends in product quality (such as the effect ofReformulated Gasoline) are given in Chapter 2 of this book.

16.1 Speciﬁcations for some common ﬁnished products
This chapter is concerned only with those energy products that are common to ev-
eryday living. They include, the LPGs, gasolines, burning oil (including kerosene),diesel fuel, jet fuels, and the black oils including fuel oil and marine diesel.
The LPG products
This category includes the normal speciﬁcation for propane and butane LPG. They
are given in Table 16.1.
The gasolines
Two grades of gasoline are given here. They represent present day and near future qual-
ity requirements meeting the environmental parameters already discussed in Chapter 2of this volume. The two grades are:

The kerosenes
There are three grades of kerosenes which are common in most reﬁneries. These are:
rOdorless kerosene
rRegular grade kerosene
rPremium kerosene
Speciﬁcations for each of these are given in Table 16.3.
Aviation turbine gasoline (ATG) and jet fuels
This product is among the most important item produced in a reﬁnery. Its quality
must conform with stringent requirements particularly for use in commercial aircraft.In this chapter the description and discussion on ATG will be conﬁned mainly to thatfor civil purposes, although reference will be made to the military grades of ATG.The speciﬁcation that sets the standard for commercial jet fuel quality is the ASTM D1655. A summary of the speciﬁcation is given in Table 16.4.
IATA (International Air Transport Association) publishes a document for the guidance
of international users of ATG. This document is titled Guidance Material for Aviation
Turbine Fuels Speciﬁcations. This guidance contains speciﬁcations for four aviation
turbine fuel types. Three of these are Kerosene type fuels (Jet A, Jet A1, and TS1)QUALITY CONTROL OF PRODUCTS IN PETROLEUM REFINING 709
and one wide cut fuel Jet B. Jet A meets the ASTM requirements, Jet A1 meets the
Joint Checklist requirements, TS1 meets the Russian GOST requirements, and JetB meets the Canadian CGSB requirements. These speciﬁcations are summarized inTable 16.5. Jet A1 is listed as the Defense Standard 91–91 which is close to the UKJetA1 standard.

*Some of the GOST test methods are signiﬁcantly different from those used in other speciﬁcations, sovalues for these properties may not agree.
Military jet fuel. The governments of the United States and many other countries
maintain separate speciﬁcations for jet fuel for military use. The reasons for separate
speciﬁcations include the operational and logistical differences between the militaryand civilian systems and the additional demands high performance jet ﬁghter enginesplace on the fuel.
There are currently two fuels in widespread use by the US military. They are JP-5
used by the Navy, and JP-8 used by the Air Force. Both are kerosene type fuels and themajor difference between them is their ﬂash point temperature. The minimum ﬂashpoint for JP-8 is 38
◦C while that for JP-5 is 60◦C. The higher ﬂash point for JP-5 is
for safer handling of the fuel on aircraft carriers.
The gas oils
Three grades of gas oils are considered here. They are:

Heating oil is used predominately as domestic heating oil in many countries. Its most
important properties are the pour point and sulfur content, A full speciﬁcation of thegas oil is given as Table 16.6.
The speciﬁcation for automotive grade gas oil (Diesel fuel) is given as Table 16.7.
Certain properties of this product are more stringent than those for the heating oil tomeet the present environmental requirements and the present design features of thediesel engine. The one item that stands out as being very stringent is the sulfur contentof the diesel. This speciﬁcation became effective in 2002. All indications are that itwill be even more stringent in 2006 (see Chapter 2 for more details).

types). These pretty much disappeared from the markets during the 1980s. No 5 fuel
was a light residual fuel used mostly in the steel industry. It is no longer widely used.No 6 fuel is a heavy residual fuel normally a mixture of atmospheric and vacuumdistillation residues cut back to adjust for viscosity with kerosene or gas oil cutterstock. This fuel oil product is almost entirely used as ship bunker oil, with somemarket outlet to stationary power plants in producing steam for their turbines. For thelast 20 years or so these markets have been in decline. Power plants are converting tothe use of coal or natural gas, and ships are leaning more to the use of marine dieselor just diesel fuel. Environmental restrictions are calling for a continual decrease inthe sulfur content of this particular product. As a result no 6 fuel is the least valuedreﬁnery product and is worth less than the crude feed itself. Reﬁners are now installingprocesses (such as ‘ deep oil cracking’ , and residue hydrocracking) to upgrade thisproduct to the more valued distillates such as gasoline and the middle distillates. Thespeciﬁcation for a No 6 fuel oil is given as Table 16.9.
The lube oils
Most marketable lube oils produced in a reﬁnery are graded by their viscosity. Pro-
prietary brands of these lube oil grades will contain additives as provided by theirparticular marketing outlets. These basic grades and their speciﬁcation are given inTable 16.10. Other speciﬁcations apply for multi-grade lube oils
These grades and their processing are described in some detail in Chapter 12.

Petroleum coke
Petroleum coke is not found in crude oil, but is the carbon compound formed from the
thermal conversion of petroleum containing resins and asphaltenes. Coke is formedin the processes to convert the residuum fuels to the more desirable distillate productsof naphtha and lighter through to the middle distillates. There are two routes bywhich this coking process proceeds. The ﬁrst and the most common is the delayedcoking route. The second is the ﬂuid coking method, and this has been made moreattractive to many reﬁners with the development of Exxon Mobil’ s proprietary processofFlexicoking. This proprietary process eliminates the coke completely by converting
it to low Btu fuel gas. By far the largest production of coke is the sponge coke fromthe delayed coking process. Uncalcined sponge coke has a heating value of about14,000 Btu/lb and is used primarily as a fuel. High sulfur sponge coke howeveris popular for use in cement plants since the sulfur reacts to form sulfates. Spongecoke is calcined to produce a coke grade suitable for anodes in the aluminum industry.Details of the speciﬁcations for green (uncalcined) coke and calcined coke are given asTable 16.11.

Sulfur
Sulfur is a byproduct of modern day reﬁneries. By the processes that make up the"
"modern hydrogen skimming reﬁnery a signiﬁcant portion of the sulfur contained inthe crude is removed as elemental sulfur for marketing as a product. It is true tosay that as the environmental requirements for reduced sulfur levels in products andemissions from the reﬁnery decreases the sulfur produced as a product increases. Inmost countries today over half of the required sulfur is produced from the petroleumand gas industries. Sulfur is stored and transported from the reﬁnery as a moltenproduct or as solid sulfur. Almost half the world’ s sulfur production is used in makingsulfuric acid and phosphate fertilizers using the sulfuric acid produced from the sulfur.A typical speciﬁcation for sulfur is given as Table 16.12.
16.2 The description of some of the more common tests
The tests described here are usually carried out in the reﬁnery laboratory. The results
these tests are used in plant control and for the quality control of ﬁnished products.There are many more laboratory and other tests that are carried out in the reﬁnerycompany’ s research and development establishment. These later tests are carried outto improve product quality parameters or to establish design data for processes anddevelopment work. These later tests would include mass spectrometry for crude oildata and assay development, pilot plant tests to establish optimum operating data, anditems such as motor vehicle road tests. Those tests described brieﬂy in the followingsections are those listed earlier.

and ﬁnished product quality. These are the ASTM D86 for naphtha and equivalentand for the kerosenes. D156 is used for the ASTM distillation of atmospheric gasoils(heating oil and diesel). The major difference between the two tests are the volumeof sample used. In the case of the D86 the sample will be 100 ml while that for D156the sample will be 200 ml. There are other differences and these will be noted in theirdescriptions which follow:
ASTM D86
The diagram in Figure 16.1 is the apparatus used for both ASTM distillations. Only
the apparatus item sizes will change and the temperature levels in the condenser bath.The measured sample is introduced into an Engler glass ﬂask (A) at 100 ml for theD86 test. The liquid ﬁlls about two thirds of the ﬂask leaving the space above theliquid to the cork in the vessel neck as vapor space. About half way along the neckof the ﬂask there is a vapor offtake tube. The open end of this tube is connected tothe condenser tube which is routed through the condenser bath (B). This condensertube emerges from the ‘ Bath’and the open end is directed into a measuring cylinder.For the lighter boiling range samples (i.e. naphthas) this cylinder is placed in a coldwater (slightly below room temperature) bath. The Engler ﬂask rests on an asbestosor similar plate (F) which has a hole 1” in diameter exposing the bottom of the ﬂaskQUALITY CONTROL OF PRODUCTS IN PETROLEUM REFINING 717

to the heat source. In this case the heat source is shown as a Bunsen burner (C). A
thermometer is introduced into the top of the ﬂask and is positioned so that the bulbis directly in line with the vapor offtake. The condenser bath is ﬁlled with water andice and allowed to reach 32
◦F before heat is applied to the sample ﬂask and the test"
"begun. The temperature of the sample is increased slowly until the liquid begins toboil. The initial boiling point is read as the temperature measured by the thermometerlocated in the ﬂask when the ﬁrst condensate drop enters the receiving cylinder (D) atthe end of the condensate bath (B). For light boiling point samples (i.e. naphthas) thisreceiver is cooled in a water bath (E). For kerosenes the water bath (E) is not required.The test is allowed to proceed at a constant rate and temperature readings are takenat predetermined recovery levels of condensate. (usually these temperatures will beat 10 vol% recovered, 30, 50, and 90 vol% recovered). When the ﬂask (A) has beenboiled apparently dry, the temperature shown by the thermometer will rise sharplyand then begin to fall. The highest temperature observed in this rise and fall is theﬁnal boiling point of the sample.
ASTM D156
The same equipment arrangement is used for this test as for the D86. In this case
however 200 ml of gas oil or diesel sample is used and the ﬂask will be an Engler 200 mlstandard. The other differences are that the hole in the screen (F) has a diameter of 2
/prime/prime.
The condenser bath contains water at room temperature and the Receiver (D) is a200 ml measuring vessel, an no water bath is required.
The ASTM distillation curves from all of the methods described above and those in
the determination of vacuum ASTM distillation (not described here as these are not718 CHAPTER 16
normal marketing or process operation measures) can be converted to TBP and EFV
curves. The methods for such conversions are given in Chapters 1 and 3 of this book.Such conversions are used primarily for process design and planning.
Flash point test method (D93)
There are two methods used for determining the ﬂash point of an intermediate and
ﬁnished petroleum products. These are the ASTM D56 The Tag Closed Cup method(commonly known as the ABEL ﬂash point) and the ASTM D93 The Pensky MartenClosed Cup method. The D56 method is used for material which has a ﬂash of between68
◦F and 148◦F while the D93 method is used for all other distillates and residuum
products with ﬂash points above 148◦F . Based on this premise the D56 is used almost
exclusively for the kerosene cut range materials. Only the Pensky Marten D93 willbe described here.
ASTM D93
A brass test cup is ﬁlled to an inside mark with the test specimen. A cover is ﬁtted of
speciﬁed dimensions, see Figure 16.2. The specimen is heated and stirred at speciﬁedrates. An ignition source in the form of a small ﬂame is directed into the cup at regularintervals. When the specimen is seen to ﬂash, the temperature of the specimen is notedas the ﬂash point of the sample.
Signiﬁcance and use
The ﬂash point is a measure of the tendency of the, material to form a ﬂammable
mixture with air under controlled laboratory conditions. It is however only one ofseveral properties that must be considered in assessing the overall ﬂammable haz-ard of the material. The ﬂash point is used to establish the ﬂammable criteria intransporting the material. Generally shipping and safety regulations will be basedon the ﬂash point criteria. The ﬂash point should NOT however be used to describeor appraise the ﬁre hazard or risk under actual ﬁre conditions. This test method(D93) provides the only closed cup ﬂash point test procedures for temperatures up to698
◦F.
Pour point and cloud point (D97)
Pour points are determined initially by heat treating the petroleum specimen above
it’ s expected pour point and then to cool the specimen in controlled stages until thepour point is observed. The pour point is the temperature of the material that it ceasesto ﬂow.QUALITY CONTROL OF PRODUCTS IN PETROLEUM REFINING 719
Figure 16.2. The Pensky Marten closed cup ﬂash point apparatus.720 CHAPTER 16
Figure 16.3. Apparatus for pour point tests.
ASTM D97
The apparatus used to determine pour point (and cloud point) consists of a cylindrical
glass jar with a ﬂat bottom a coke stopper at it’ s top. A thermometer is insertedthrough the coke stopper so that the bulb is immersed up to 3 mm of the capillaryin the specimen. The sample is inserted into the jar up to a prescribed level. Theapparatus is shown in the following Figure 16.3 and is self-explanatory.
The sample is ﬁrst heated as follows:Material with an estimated pour point above 33
◦C— heat to a temperature of expected
pour point plus 9◦C but at least 45◦C in a bath controlled to at least 48◦C. Material
with an expected pour point of below 33◦C— heat to at least 45◦C and cool to 15◦C
in a bath controlled at 6◦C.QUALITY CONTROL OF PRODUCTS IN PETROLEUM REFINING 721
Commence the test then by sequential cooling and observing the ﬂow of the specimen
using cooling baths as follows:
For temperatures down to
Bath 1— Ice and water 9◦C
Bath 2— Crushed ice and sodium chloride −12◦C
Bath 3— Crushed ice and calcium chloride −27◦C
Bath 4— Acetone and solid carbon dioxide −57◦C."
"The specimen is checked at regular intervals of cooling (every 3–5◦C) for ﬂow. This
checking must be done with great care by just slowly tilting the jar to the horizontalposition for not more than 5 seconds, and observing if there is ﬂow. The moving ofthe sample from bath to bath should be at the following schedule:
Specimen at 27
◦C move to bath 1
Specimen at 9◦C move to bath 2
Specimen at −6◦C move to bath 3
Specimen at −24◦C and below move to bath 4.
The reporting of the pour point is the temperature where no ﬂow is observed plus3
◦C.
Kinematic viscosity (D446)
The kinematic viscosity of an oil is obtained by measuring the time required for a
sample of the oil to ﬂow, under gravity through a capillary. The capillary is a part ofthe calibrated viscometer and the ﬂow through it of the oil is at a known temperature.These viscometers are in several sizes and differing design. The conﬁguration andsize of the capillary are calibrated and tested to provide a constant value for thatparticular viscometer.
ASTM D446
The viscometer shown in Figure 16.4 is one of many types. It is used for obtaining
the viscosity of transparent liquids. The viscometer shown in Figure 16.4 is des-ignated a SIL. Its important features and its calibration constant are given in Ta-ble 16.14.
The viscometer(s) shown may be one of many. These are suspended using a specially
designed holder in a bath containing water with some glycol added to reduce vapor-ization or prevent boiling. The bath is maintained at a constant temperature at which722 CHAPTER 16

the viscosity is to be reported. The test temperature may be as high as 100◦C thus the
use of glycol in the bath water to prevent actual boiling.
The oil sample is introduced into the viscometer through tube L by tilting the viscome-
ter to about 30◦from the vertical with bulb A below capillary R. After introducing the
sample attach the viscometer into the holder and insert the viscometer into the bathso that it is vertical. Allow the sample to reach the bath temperature usually about30 min before starting the test. Using suction (all laboratories should have a vacuumsystem), draw up the sample through bulb C to about 5 mm above the upper timingmark E. Release the vacuum and allow the sample to ﬂow by gravity. Measure thetime for the sample to ﬂow from the timing mark E to the lower timing mark F . Thisis the time tin the equation:

Reid vapor pressure (D323)
This test is the standard test for low boiling point distillates. It is used for naphthas,
gasolines, light cracked distillates and aviation gasolines. For the heavier distillateswith vapor pressures expected to be below 26 psig at 100
◦F the apparatus and proce-
dures will be different. Only the Reid vapor pressure for those distillates with vaporpressures above 26 psig at 100

removed tilted once or twice and replaced for a further 15 min. At the end of this timethe vapor pressure of the test sample is read from the pressure gage to the nearest0.2 psi.
Weathering test for the volatility of LPG (D1837)
This test is a measure of the relative purity of liqueﬁed petroleum gases (LPG). The"
"test results give the indication of the pentane content of butane LPG or the amount ofbutane in a sample of propane LPG. V olatility expressed in terms of 95% evaporatedtemperature of the test sample indicates the measure of least volatile fuel componentspresent. The apparatus used for this test is shown as Figure 16.5.
The weathering tube is a centrifuge cone-shaped tube conforming to the dimen-

Smoke point of kerosenes and aviation turbine fuels (D1322)
The sample is burned in an enclosed wick fed lamp that is calibrated daily against
pure aromatic blends of known smoke point. The smoke point of the test sample isquoted as the maximum height of ﬂame that can be achieved without smoking. Theapparatus that is used for this test is shown as Figure 16.7.QUALITY CONTROL OF PRODUCTS IN PETROLEUM REFINING 727

ASTM—D1322
Calibrating the apparatusThe apparatus is calibrated daily against known aromatic compound smoke points to
establish a correction factor. The two reference fuel blends are: Toluene and 2,2,4-methyl pentane and details of these fuels are given in Table 16.16.728 CHAPTER 16

The test procedure is as follows:
Figures 16.8 and 16.9 are shown below for detailed reference:
1.0 Soak a piece of extracted and dried wick about 125 mm in length in the test
sample, and place it in the wick tube of the candle. Carefully ease out any twists
arising from this operation.
2.0 Introduce about 20 ml of the test sample into the clean dry candle place the wick
tube into the candle and screw and secure. Then insert the candle into the lamp.
3.0 Light the candle and adjust the wick so that the ﬂame is approximately 10 mm
high. Allow the lamp to burn for 5 min. Raise the candle until a smoky tailappears, then lower the candle slowly until the following stages occur:
rFirst stage: An elongated pointed as sown as Flame A in Figure 16.10
rSecond stage: The pointed tip just disappears, leaving a slightly blunted ﬂameshown as Flame B in Figure 16.10
rThird stage: A well rounded ﬂame tip as shown in Flame C in Figure 16.10

Conradson carbon residue of petroleum products (D189)
This test is to determine the amount of carbon residue left after complete evaporation"
"and pyrolysis of an oil. The degree of this carbon content is indicative of the cokeforming properties of the oil. The value of the Conradson carbon content is importantin most heavy oil hydrotreating, and most cracking processes. A number of moderncatalysts used in heavy oil cracking have been developed to withstand the adverseeffect of carbon lay-down. Still excessive coke formation remains a problem in mostcracking processes. The apparatus used for this test is shown as Figure 16.11.

The apparatus consists of a porcelain crucible containing a weighed sample of the
oil. This crucible is placed in the center of an iron crucible which is itself placed in alarger iron crucible. Both iron crucibles are ﬁtted with covers and are vented through732 CHAPTER 16

The crucibles are partially surrounded by insulating brick work on which the metallichood rests. Heat is supplied to the crucibles by a burner located below the wire meshsupport. The sample is heated for a speciﬁed period of time until all the volatilecontent of the oil has evaporated leaving the carbon as residue. The carbon contentof the oil is calculated as the weight of the carbon left as a percentage of the weightof the original sample.QUALITY CONTROL OF PRODUCTS IN PETROLEUM REFINING 733

Bromine number of petroleum distillates (D1159)
The bromine number is a measure of oleﬁns in a petroleum distillate boiling up to
600◦F . The number is supporting evidence of the purity of the product with respect
to its oleﬁn content.
D1159
The apparatus used in this test is any apparatus that can perform titration to a pre-
set end point. Such an apparatus may include an electrical meter with two polarizedelectrodes of sufﬁcient voltage to indicate the end point. The titration vessel is ajacketed glass vessel about 120 mm high and 45 mm internal diameter. The samplecontained in the vessel will be kept at 32–45
◦F . The burette will be a normal titration
burette capable of measuring the titration reagent in graduations of 0.05 ml or smaller.Place 10 ml of 1,1,1-trichloromethane or dichloromethane in the titration vessel andintroduce the test specimen as indicated in Table 16.17.
Fill the titration vessel to the mark with the selected solvent. Mix the contents well.
Titrate the sample with the standard bromine–bromate solution— stir the specimenwell during the titration. The end point is noted by a sudden change in potential onan electrometric end point indicator due to the presence of bromine. The brominenumber is calculated by the following equation:

The sample is burned in a closed system using a suitable lamp (Figure 16.12) and an"
"artiﬁcial atmosphere of 70% carbon dioxide and 30% oxygen to prevent the formationof nitrogen oxides (Figure 16.13). The oxides of sulfur are absorbed and oxidized tosulfuric acid by means of a hydrogen peroxide solution. This solution is ﬂushed withair to remove carbon dioxide. The sulfur as sulfate in the absorbent is determinedby titration of the sulfuric acid with standard sodium hydroxide. The sample size fordirect combustion is 10–15 grams if the predicted sulfur content is below 0.05% forpredicted sulfur content 0.05–0.4% the sample size should be 5–10 g.
The calculation of the sulfur content from the titration is given by the following
equation.
Sulfur Content wt% =16.03 M×(A/10W)

this case the factor 16.03M in the calculation becomes 1.0.
Octane number research and motor (details of this test are given
in ASTM standards Part 7)
By deﬁnition, an octane number is that percentage of isooctane in a blend of isooctane
and normal heptane that exactly matches the knock behavior of the gasoline. Thus,a 90 octane gasoline matches the knock characteristic of a blend containing 90%isooctane and 10% n-heptane.
The knock characteristics are determined in the laboratory using a standard singlecylinder test engine equipped with a super sensitive knock meter. The reference fuel(isooctane and C
7blend) is run and compared with a second run using the gasoline
sample. Two octane numbers are usually given: the ﬁrst is the research octane number(RON) and the second is the motor octane number (MON). The same basic equipmentis used for both octane numbers, but the engine speed is increased for the motoroctane number. The actual octane number obtained in a commercial engine would besomewhere between the two numbers. The signiﬁcance of the two octane numbers isto evaluate the sensitivity of the gasoline to the severity of the operating conditionsin the engine. Invariably the research octane number is higher than the motor octanenumber, the difference between them is quoted as the ‘ sensitivity’of the gasoline.QUALITY CONTROL OF PRODUCTS IN PETROLEUM REFINING 737
Conclusion
The speciﬁcations and the selected tests given here represent the control measures
used to establish product quality control. Much of the testing described here areused for plant control while all the tests are necessary to ensure that product qualityof ﬁnished products is met. In modern reﬁnery practice much the plant control isachieved using ‘ in line’analyzers tied to control system computers. These computersautomatically adjust plant conditions to meet set product quality criteria. A similar ‘ inline’analysis is used for blending rundown streams for ﬁnished products. Invariably,though, laboratory testing is still used to ‘ spot check’plant intermediate productquality, and laboratory testing is always used as ﬁnal check on ﬁnished product quality.Chapter 17
Economics
17.1 Reﬁnery planning, economics
and handling new projects
D.S.J. Jones
This chapter is divided into three parts. The ﬁrst deals with the planning of a reﬁnery’ s
operation, which includes its optimized crude runs, product slate, and any processexpansion or debottlenecking that may be required to meet this optimized operation.The second part deals with the process economic evaluation of a proposed new reﬁneryor new facilities within an existing reﬁnery. The third part is a brief description anddiscussion of a reﬁning company’ s participation in the execution of an approvedengineering and construction project.
This second part of the chapter is closely related to the ﬁrst part in so far that process
studies and the ultimate selection of any process or processing route is based on theapproved marketing strategy for the reﬁning company. This in turn is based on theconclusions following the work undertaken in Part 1. The ﬁnal phase in this reﬁneryoperation is described in Part 3. This outlines the preparation of contracts to thirdparties for the installation of new or expanded facilities. It includes the choice of thetype of contract to be solicited and follows with the selection of a suitable engineeringcompany to execute the work. Finally, it discusses the company’ s activities associatedwith the execution of the project by contractors and the subsequent commissioningand acceptance of the completed facilities.
17.1.1 Reﬁnery operation planning
The basic organization of an oil company consists essentially of three main depart-
ments:
1.0 The Supply Department
2.0 The Reﬁning Department3.0 The Marketing Department
739740 CHAPTER 17
The function of these three main departments are co-ordinated by a supply de-"
"partment. This department undertakes this role in accordance with the followingsequence:
1.0 Marketing department informs the supply department with the quantities of prod-
ucts they can sell.
2.0 Supply department, after making adjustments for stock levels, advise the reﬁnery
of the quantity of each product required.
3.0 The reﬁning department advise the supply department of the actual quantities
they can produce and how much crude they will require to do so.
4.0 The supply department arranges with the marine department for the necessary
shipping to:
rProvide the crude
rLift the products
rImport the quantities that cannot be produced
In the above sequence of events Item 3 is carried out by the planning section of the
reﬁnery department. Their objective is to translate the production requirements givenby the supply department into a workable system, which speciﬁes the actual operationof each plant to ensure that the ﬁnal result is the most economical one practicable.This is termed the ‘ Running Plan’for the operation.
Running plans
Running plans are developed and issued on a monthly basis. They usually cover
periods varying from 11 to 18 months ahead. Long term periods are broken down intoquarters, short term (up to 6 months ahead) are broken down into months. The mainuses of the running plan are to provide data for:
rKeeping the supply department and the company executives informed
rProvide information for long term chartering of ships
rArrangement of import programs
rPin point future product quality and equipment difﬁculties
The running plan is used in a reﬁnery as the basis for an Operating Program. Such aprogram is developed in the reﬁnery by converting the plan into a day to day operationprogram for each reﬁnery plant. At the end of every month the plant operation for thatmonth is summarized and compiled into an Operations Summary which comparesthe actual plant operation with the program. Usually the reﬁnery organization willinclude a planning department and the production of the both the Operating Programand the subsequent summary is their responsibility.ECONOMICS 741
The rules of planning
Before looking at the development of running plans in some detail it is necessary
to understand some fundamental rules. These are listed below and are the “ PlanningData” :
rEquipment Availability
rPlant Performance
rService Factors
rProduct Quality
rPlanning Properties
rBlending Properties
rCrude Availability
rCrude Quality
rTankage and Lines Availability
rEconomic Rules
Most of these rules are self explanatory, but notes on a few of those items, which arenot so apparent, are as follows:
Plant performance
This is an important requirement in planning the reﬁnery daily and long term oper-
ation. The exact operating capability of the various reﬁnery plants must be known.Such data that is essential are:
rYields under any operating condition and any feed quality
rProduct quality under any operating condition and feed quality
rMaximum and minimum plant throughput
rFuel consumption
Blending properties
Most ﬁnished products leaving the reﬁnery are blends of one or more basic process
streams. For example all gasoline products will be blends of straight run naphtha’ sand some high octane streams from a cracking unit and/or streams from a catalyticreformer. Full description and discussion on blending and blended products are givenin Chapter 1 of this Handbook. In planning the reﬁnery’ s day to day operation theseblending techniques and, when applicable, blending indices are used.
Crude availability
With most major oil reﬁning companies the company’ s central supply department
issues the availability of crude slates (quantities and crude source) when they issue742 CHAPTER 17
the requirement data. In most cases the respective reﬁning company has contract for
the purchase of a few speciﬁc crudes and their quantities. Of these basic crude slatesone or two of the crude oils may be increased or decreased if necessary. These arecalled marginal crude oils. Most often there are two types of crude oils in the slatewhich are marginal. One of these marginal crude oils would be used if more crudethan is shown on the slate is required. The other would be backed out of the slate if theentire projected slate was not required. Thus marginal crude oils play an importantpart in the economic running plans for a reﬁnery operation.
Economic rules
Using the planning rules, it is possible to devise an inﬁnite number of schemes that
would meet the majority of the market requirements. Only one such scheme howeverwould be the most proﬁtable. It is the most proﬁtable plan or scheme that has tobe determined and implemented, and to do this it is necessary to follow some basiceconomic rules. These rules may be developed with answers to the following typicalquestions:
1.0 If all requirements cannot be met, in which priority order should the various
products be placed?
2.0 Is it proﬁtable to run the reﬁnery to meet just a fuel oil product requirement. That"
"is not to produce waxy distillates at all?
3.0 What is the optimum octane number severity operation for the reforming and/or
cracking units to meet gasoline requirements?
4.0 Which is the cheapest middle distillates to import if this becomes necessary to
meet a product slate?
5.0 Is it economical to utilize a surplus unit capacity to produce feed to another? For
example to use surplus deasphalting capacity to produce feed for the catalytic
cracker.
6.0 Does it pay to divert straight run naphtha to reﬁnery fuel in a situation where
naphtha outlet is limiting?
The following table is a simpliﬁed example of the use of these economic rules todetermine the changing of fuel oil ‘ length’in a middle distillate outlet limiting situ-ation. The only units considered here are the crude distillation unit (atmospheric andvacuum), cat reformer unit, and the cat cracker (FCCU). Being a middle distillate out-let limiting there will be spare capacity in the units considered, and all requirementsare met except for fuel oil. The economic rule in this case is that the most proﬁtableplan will be when the crude and fuel oil are at a minimum while still meeting therequirements of the other products in the slate.ECONOMICS 743
Developing the running plan
In most reﬁning companies with more than one reﬁnery installation running plans
are developed in the company’ s corporate ofﬁces. In this way access to the requireddata (such as crude availability, product slate etc.) are readily available to the planner.Normally running plans are published on a monthly basis. Again normally these planscover a period of 18 months. The early part of the period, say the ﬁrst six months, willbe studied on a monthly basis, and the remainder on a quarterly basis.
The use and purpose of the reﬁnery running plans
The running plans are designed to provide corporate management with data with
respect to the following:
1. The anticipated pattern of production i.e. the surpluses and the deﬁcits that are
likely to occur.
2. The likely operations of the reﬁneries in the company. This covers crude runs and
reﬁnery throughputs.
3. Any inadequacies in reﬁning capacities to meet projected proﬁt margins. This may
form the basis for reﬁnery expansion program. (This is dealt with in a separate
item of this section of the chapter).
4. Indication as to where and when extra business can be accommodated in the
company’ s operating plan.
5. The basis for ﬁnancial forecasting and estimates of proﬁt and loss.
The planning schemes
The content of the running plan will conform to the rules of planning listed and
discussed earlier. The development of all running plans begin with schematic diagramsgiving as many options as possible of the routes by which a required product slatecan be achieved from a particular crude availability slate. The mechanism to arriveat this is not unlike the process conﬁguration study described in Chapter 2 of thisEncyclopedia. In the case of the plan schemes however the objective is to ﬁt theprocess streams to a ﬁxed reﬁnery conﬁguration in order to meet a product slate. Inthese schemes excess products are corrected by either reducing crude throughput orusing the stream as blend stock or feed to other unit(s). Deﬁcits in the product slatemay be solved by importing the necessary product components to complete a scheme.An example of a typical planning scheme to meet middle distillates (Jet Fuel in thiscase) and specialties (White Spirit in this case) is given as Figure 17.1.1.
Several of such schemes may be developed to meet this particular product slate criteria.
Each of these will be subject to an economic analysis, and this may extend to one ormore of the company’ s several reﬁneries. These economic analyses are made usingFigure 17.1.1. An example of a planning scheme diagram.ECONOMICS 745

the same criteria of cumulative product proﬁts (including plant operating costs) as
described above in economic rules and the example provided by Table 17.1.1. Com-
puter technology is used extensively in planning these days. Indeed most reﬁnerycompanies possess their proprietary programs similar to the linear program describedin Part 2 of this chapter to evaluate the economics of the schemes and to determinethe optimum one. However, the development of the scheme itself still remains withthe planning engineer or development engineer for most companies.
The application of running plans in identifying reﬁning inadequacies
This item illustrates a function of the running plan in identifying lack of reﬁning"
"capacity under certain conditions. An example of a work sheet for the report is givenin Appendix 17.1 of this chapter. The scenario surrounding this exercise is as fol-lows:
Background
A large international oil company Concord Petroleum Company (Fictional) has re-
quested two of its European reﬁning afﬁliates to submit plans for low cost debottlenecking of distillation capacity which can be ‘ on stream’by next winter. The twode-bottle neck cases that are to be considered are the company’ s Kent reﬁnery andthe company’ s South Wales reﬁnery. The expansion for the Kent reﬁnery crude unitwill be 34,000 BPSD and that for the South Wales Reﬁnery crude unit will be 40,000BPSD. The study will determine whether either or both of these debottleneckingroutes represents an economic investment route for Concord Petroleum Company tomeet the long range expansion program.746 CHAPTER 17

Basis for assessing requirements
The following table is the Base Running Plan. It highlights the two UK reﬁnery’ s crude
availability and their respective requirements with surplus and deﬁcit highlights:
Table 17.1.2 represents the short range status. Other running plans for other years, are
summarized below. This Table 17.1.3 gives the product deﬁciencies/(surplus) versuscrude requirement to satisfy product deﬁciencies over those years.
See the following notes for Table 17.1.3:
1.0Swing capacity is deﬁned as the sum of international bunkers plus volume of
seasonal storage. It is assumed that crude is run for international bunkers in the
summer if necessary, and an equal volume of fuel oil is imported in the winteragainst inland fuel oil requirements. Thus, swing capacity represents the volume
of crude which can be run in the summer against winter requirements.
2.0 Net crude is the volume of crude running capacity required in summer and winter
when maximum use is made of swing capacity.ECONOMICS 747

3.0 Minimum crude capacity is the volume of distillation capacity which must be
available just to meet deﬁciencies and making maximum practical use of the
swing capacity.
Eight basic schemes were studied to meet the minimum capacities for satisfying thedeﬁciencies. These were as follow:
Case 1. Expand Kent distillation by 82 mbsd— DebottleneckCase 2. Expand Kent distillation by 34 mbsd on CDU 101 and 50 mbsd on CDU 102Case 3. Expand Kent distillation by 50 mbsd on CDU 101 and 34 mbsd on CDU 102Case 4. Expand S. Wales distillation by 100 mbsd— Grass RootsCase 5. Expand Kent distillation by 100 mbpsd— Grass RootsCase 6. Expand Kent distillation by 34 mbsd and S. Wales by 40 mbpsd— De-bottle
neck
Case 7. Expand Kent distillation by 40 mbsd and S. Wales by 34 mbpsd – De-bottle
neck
Case 8. Expand S. Wales distillation by 75 mbsd— Grass Roots.
There were in addition one sub case for each of cases 4, 6, 7, and 8. These sub casestook into account special depreciation allowances for the S. Wales reﬁnery.
The results
The discounted cash ﬂows at 10% for the 8 cases and the four sub cases were calculated
for the entire period as shown in Table 17.1.4 (This took into account the company’ slong range plan and forecast). The preferred case was case 6 with the cognizance of theS. Wales reﬁnery depreciation allowance. This cash ﬂow for this item is as follows:748 CHAPTER 17"

Author’ s Note: The names and location of the company and its reﬁneries are, of cou-
rse, ﬁctitious. The study though is not. The author actually participated in the studyitself, and was later the lead engineer in the process design of one of the selectedreﬁnery (Case 6A) debottlenecking expansion.
A copy of one worksheet used in the study is given in the appendix to this section.
Most calculations at that time were done by hand, although the discounted cash ﬂowcalculations were computerized.
The reﬁnery operating program
One of the major uses of the running plan is to enable the reﬁneries of the company
to develop their own operating program. The running plan sets the objective for thereﬁnery production over a short term and provides a long term forecast. The operatingprogram translates these requirements into a day by day program of work. Operatingprograms are concerned about the short term plans for the operation, and are preparedfor a monthly period. Thus while running plans are calculated in terms of Barrels perCalendar Day, operating programs are always in terms of Barrels per Stream Day.
The content of the operating program
The actual format of operating programs will vary from company to company, how-
ever, they will follow a similar pattern. They will consist of the following items:
rA crude oil program
rAn intermediate stock report
rA table of programmed production
rA blending schedule
rAn operating schedule
rOperating notes
A crude oil program is a table of the reﬁnery’ s current crude oil inventory withprojected imports, feed outlets, and the storage tank reference. An example of thistable is given as Appendix 17.2 of this Chapter.ECONOMICS 749
An intermediate stock report is similar to the crude oil program but it refers to the
reﬁneries intermediate stocks, which will usually be blended to ﬁnished products. Anexample of this table is also given as Appendix 17.3.
The table of programmed production is simply the scheduled ﬁnished product make
from the reﬁnery. The blending schedule is self-explanatory and is usually in aform of simple block ﬂow diagrams. A typical middle distillate schedule is given inFigure 17.1.2.
Operating notes include any critical requirements or operational changes. Note op-
erating programs can be updated on a weekly or even daily basis if the Company’ sSupply Department initiates a change in running plans, that affect a particular reﬁn-ery’ s operating program. An example of an operating note is as follows:
Current program
Unit F101 Light gas oil Marine diesel White spirit Turbo Jet JP4
Supply dept requirement 750 m bpsd 235 m bpsd 40 m bpsd 181 m bpsd
Reﬁnery make 668 202 40 181
Supply must have absolute minimum of 725 mbpsd of light gas oil i.e. +57 MB’ s
Can stand only 152 MB’ s of Marine diesel i.e. −50 MB’ s
Action: Change kero/gas oil operation to kero/diesel operation.
Preparing an operating program
In present day reﬁning industry both the running plan and the subsequent operating
program are computerized. However, their preparation requires the same input asthe old manual system. In the case of the operating program these would follow thesequence listed below:
1.0 In order to begin assembling the operating program the planner will need to know
the following details:
rThe running plan for the reﬁnery for the month in question
rThe latest crude slate data
rWhat plants are scheduled for shut down during the life of the program

2.0 Prepare an outline operating schedule to meet intermediate product require-
ments and timed to maintain adequate intermediate products in tankage (Ap-
pendix 17.4).
3.0 Cut the crude(s) TBP into the required product cuts, for the crude unit operation.4.0 Cut the product from the other units (such as FCCU, and cat reformer) to meet
intermediate products.
5.0 Balance the crude run against production. From the cutting scheme and schedule
outline develop the detailed and balanced reﬁnery ﬂow plan.
6.0 Develop the detailed operating program (Appendix 17.5).
Monitoring the operating program"
"The planning section in a reﬁnery organization is usually delegated the duty of mon-
itoring the Program. The following activities are associated with this monitoringfunction:
1.0 A check is maintained on the actual product produced, by control room charts,
tank dips, and the like. This is done daily and deviation from program noted with
explanation of cause for the deviation.
2.0 Weekly operating schedules are issued to allow for any deviation to program.
These would include such causes as:
rDelay in tanker arrivals
rChanges in crude slate
rChanges in product requirements
rChanges in crude fractionator yields
rPlant operational problems
Example is provided in Appendix 17.6.
3.0 Daily meeting with the department responsible for oil movements and shipping
in the reﬁnery. These meetings are to review shipping and oil movement statusto and from tankage.
4.0 Frequent meetings with the operating and the reﬁnery process department to
review plant operations.
5.0 Contact the company’ s supply department with regard to:
rCrude shipment and changes
rLifting products out of reﬁnery schedule (see note below)
rChanges in requirements
Note: At times of high inventories in the reﬁnery prompt lifting is essential to keepingthe reﬁnery operating as programmed.
Operating summary
An operating summary is a document giving details of the reﬁnery’ s performance
against plan. This is issued at the end of each month. A summary of throughputs and752 CHAPTER 17
yields are usually supplied by the accounts department of the reﬁnery. Comments on
production versus program are made by the reﬁnery’ s planning department.
17.1.2 Process evaluation and economic analysis
Among the principal functions of a reﬁnery’ s development engineer is to generate
ideas for implementing the supply department’ s planned requirements (both shortterm and long term) with the most economic process conﬁguration. In carrying outthis function the engineer is required to study various processing routes or changes toexisting process routes and conﬁgurations. When satisﬁed that the technical aspect ofany proposed changes or additions are feasible and sound he or she must now satisfythe company management that it is economically attractive. The proposal must alsobe shown to be the best of any possible alternatives that may be available to achievethe same objective.
This chapter sets out to describe some basic techniques used in carrying out this
function.
Study approach
Process studies are usually initiated after a very precise deﬁnition by the company’ s
management of the company’ s immediate and long term production objectives. Apartfrom this deﬁnition being a premise of the company’ s annual operating budget it alsoaims to fulﬁll its marketing strategy. Often such a deﬁnition results in changes beingrequired to be made to the process facilities either in the short term or long termto meet these objectives. The company will look to the Development Engineers toprovide deﬁnition of these changes and to support the deﬁnition(s) with whatevertechnical and economic data necessary for management to make their “ GO/NO GO”decisions. Figure 17.1.3 shows the steps in a typical study.
This particular study route is to deﬁne an expansion of an existing process conﬁgura-
tion by adding a new group of plants. The steps shown in Figure 17.1.3 are describedas follows:
Step 1. Receive and review the supply departments requirements.
This step is extremely important. The development engineer or engineers working
on the study must understand completely what is required and what the end productof the study must fulﬁll. There is usually also a time element for the completionof the work. This too must be understood and planned for. Normally the studypremise is presented in a written document with copies to all study participants.The contents of the document must be studied by all concerned. A study ‘ KickOff’meeting is always beneﬁcial where participants and management review thestudy premises together before commencing work on the study.Review management's

Figure 17.1.3. Steps in a typical process study.754 CHAPTER 17
Step 2. Obtain stream ﬂows from existing plants.
In cases where existing plants are to form part of the study premise a detail analysis"
"of the performance of the plants must be made. This almost certainly will involveperformance test runs under pre-calculated operating conditions. The test run re-sults are evaluated and included in the analysis of products to meet the study’ sproduct slate.
Step 3. Develop product pattern from plant data for new processes.
This will be executed in parallel with step 2. Here new processes that may beincluded in the study to meet the product requirements are examined and theirproduct pattern developed. Process licensors may be involved at this stage to providedata on their proprietary processes. As may the reﬁning company’ s own researchdepartment.
Step 4. Evaluate surplus and shortfalls in meeting the objective.
Steps 2 and 3 are now used to determine the possible product slates achievableusing plant yields and blending recipes. Any surplus or shortfalls in the productslate that may now exist must be eliminated by further work in step 2 or 3 or both.
Step 5. Establish process options and constraints.
With a ﬁrm product slate work may now commence to map processing routes thatwill achieve the product objective. This will include very rough plant conﬁgurationsirrespective of cost or other constraints that will fulﬁll a processing route. Thisstep should end with the elimination of the more obvious undesirable routes. Forexample those routes which contain very small process units or those that containunit processes that have undesirable by products. This step should provide 5 or 6reasonable process options for further study.
Step 6. Commence screening studies.
The purpose of this item is to reduce the number of possible options to two or atthe most three process conﬁgurations that appear most economically attractive. Toarrive at the selected options those alternates arrived at in step 5 are allocated acapital and operating costs. The capital costs in this case are very rough estimatesarrived at by applying factors to the installed cost for similar processes. Details ofthis technique in cost estimating are given later in this chapter in item 4 “ CapitalCost Estimates” . Licensors are usually requested to participate in the developmentof these cost items in the case of their proprietary processes. The operating costsfor nonproprietary processes are also factored from similar processes. With thesecost data in place an incremental pay-out time is calculated for each option. Theoption with the lowest capital cost is used as a base case and the others comparedagainst it. Details of this calculation are given later in this chapter.The two (or three) options with the lowest positive incremental pay-out time againstthe base case are selected for further study.
Step 7. Prepare data for a more accurate cost estimate.
The credibility of any economic study depends to a large extent on the accuracyof the data used in predicting the various cost items. The principle cost item willbe the capital cost of the processes to be installed and/or revamped. The next step inECONOMICS 755
the study therefore is for the development engineer to provide basic engineering for
a“Semi Deﬁnitive” capital cost estimate to be prepared. (Very often the reﬁning
company may solicit third party Engineering Contractors to undertake this step.)Should the project proceed from study stage to installation, this estimate may beused as the ﬁrst project budget estimate for project control. Details of this typeof estimate is given later in this chapter. Brieﬂy for this estimate developmentengineers (and/or third party engineering contractors) will:
rPrepare process ﬂow sheets (complete with mass balances).
rPrepare preliminary mechanical ﬂow sheets (complete with line and instrumentSizes and speciﬁcations).
rInitiate all equipment data sheets sufﬁcient for obtaining manufacturers ﬁrmprices.
rReview and select manufacturers offers for equipment.
rUsing selected manufacturer’ s equipment data, prepare a preliminary utility bal-ance and size by factoring new or expanded utilities facilities.
rFactor additional offsite facilities as required.
Step 8. Calculate cash ﬂow for selected conﬁgurations.
The selected manufacturers equipment offer will also include a delivery time forthe equipment item. Using these and other experience factors prepare a preliminaryschedule for the installation of the facilities. This is executed by the experiencedschedule engineers of the Company or by accepted consultants.
Using this schedule the development engineer participates with others (Usually
members of the company’ s project management department or ﬁnance depart-ments) to split the budget down to annual payments over the construction periodas scheduled. The exercise continues to allocate pay-out of the capital costs on anannual basis over a prescribed period after plant start-up. This is also discussedlater in this chapter.
Step 9. Calculate the return on investment based on a discounted cash ﬂow basis."
"The development engineer proceeds to develop the return on investment using thecash ﬂow developed in step 8 for the selected conﬁgurations. A technique usingthe discounted cash ﬂow principle is used for this purpose. This provides a moreaccurate and more credible result than a ROI arrived at by the simple methodwhere no account is taken of the construction time and cash ﬂow. Details of ROIcalculations are given later in this chapter.
Step 10. Prepare the study report and presentation to management.
Much of the report should be written as the study project proceeds. In this wayfacts which are still fresh in ones mind are recorded accurately. The ﬁnal reportmust be concise but complete with all salient points. Techniques in report writingis not included as a subject here. Sufﬁcient to say that communicating the studyand its results effectively is as important as any technique and good engineering“ know how” used in the work. The same applies to the ﬁnal oral presentation tomanagement. The study, the methodology, and ﬁnally, the results must be presentedin a manner that maintains interest and stimulates the decision making mechanism.756 CHAPTER 17
This completes a typical study approach. It needs to be pointed out that should the
screening study reveal an option which far surpasses any of the others studied in termsof pay-out this could be the only option that then needs the further study as describedin steps 7–10. Such a situation saves a considerable time and effort.
Building process conﬁgurations and the screening study
(See also Chapter 2 of this Handbook).From item 1 above it can be seen that the ﬁrst major event, that involves in depth
examination in a process study, is the screening of options. Here a very simple andpreliminary economic comparison of the options is carried out. This comparison isviable because the basis for the economic criteria is the same for each of the options. Itmust be borne in mind that a prerequisite for carrying out any of these process studiesis a good working knowledge of the processes involved. This example has been chosenbecause the ultimate product slate is achieved through the addition of new processes,changing operating conditions of existing units, and of course blending base stocks.
The example then is a requirement by a petroleum reﬁnery to upgrade its fuel oil
product to more ﬁnancially lucrative lighter products. This is a fairly common pro-gram in this particular industry because of the ﬂuctuating needs of the fuel market.The example calculation given here to illustrate the study is the base conﬁgurationpublished in an earlier book “ Elements of Petroleum Processing” by the author. This
may be found at the end of the ﬁrst chapter of that book, and the block ﬂow sheet isgiven here as Figure 17.1.4. The objective of this reﬁnery conﬁguration is to maximizegasoline and middle distillate but still retaining sufﬁcient of the atmospheric residuefrom the crude distillation as fuel oil.
In the example given here it is intended to reduce the amount of fuel oil and to produce
as much gasoline and diesel as possible to give the best return on investment. For thispurpose six well proven processing routes have been selected for preliminary study.These are as follows:
rThermally crack all of the atmospheric residue. This will be a single stage unit.
rVacuum distill all of the atmospheric residue. The waxy distillate will be crackedin a ﬂuid catalytic cracker producing gas, gasoline, naphtha, and light cycle oil as adiesel blend component. The vacuum residue from the vacuum unit will be thermallycracked to give additional gas, LPG, naphtha (for gasoline production), and gas oilfor diesel blending.
rThe same as option 2. except there will be no thermal cracker for the vacuumresidue.
rVacuum distill all the atmospheric residue and hydrocrack the waxy distillate.DE – C 2

rProcess the atmospheric residue through a delayed coking unit.
rFinally, use a proprietary ﬂuid coking unit for the atmospheric residue that eliminates
the coke by converting it into low Btu gas.
The last two options are eliminated after a preliminary study because the is no eco-nomically attractive outlet for the coke and no effective use for the low Btu gas in thisreﬁnery.
The example calculation that follows provides the detail calculation for Scheme 1 and"

Similar block ﬂow sheetswould be prepared for the other study schemes but these are not shown here but aﬂow description is given for these three schemes.
Example calculation
It is required to develop a processing scheme in which the gasoline and diesel products
are increased at the expense of the fuel oil product. The capacity of the present units,the ﬂow conﬁguration and ﬂow rates are given in Figure 17.1.4. The reﬁnery fencepricing of the products are historical and do not reﬂect recent escalation

Note: There is a volumetric increase in the total products over the feed.
This is due to the changes in gravity of the products of cracking. The total
weight and moles will still be the same between feed and products.
Handling the products
Figure 17.1.5 shows the routing of the product streams from unit to unit. The gas from
the thermal cracker (Gas to C5) and the naphtha are routed to the existing naphthahydrotreater which will be expanded in size to accommodate this. The hydrotreatedmaterial will subsequently go to the splitter and debutanizer, respectively. The existingreformer and light ends unit will also be expanded to cater for the thermal crackerlight products. The gas oil from the thermal cracker will be hydrotreated in a new orexpanded hydrotreater to meet diesel pool requirements. Thus, new unit sizes will be:
Naphtha hydrotreater: Total new ﬂow =14,809 BPCD +12,732 BPCD
=27,541 BPCD
New size @ 86% service factor =27,541
0.86=32,024 BPSD
which is an increase of 72% above the existing unit. This is too large to consider a
revamp therefore build a new unit 13,500 BPSD in parallel. The same applies to thesplitter.
Catalytic reformer
New feed to the reformer is 16,191 BPCD. At a 86% service factor the new size willbe:
17,504
0.86=20,353 BPSD.
Revamp the catalytic reformer by 9,000 BPSD.ECONOMICS 761
Light ends
New total feed to the debutanizer is 9,283 BPCD. With a service factor of 90% thisgives a new capacity of 10,000 BPSD, an increase of 58%. This unit will be revampedat a cost of 10% of a new unit.
The depropanizer and deethanizer will be expanded with parallel units the same size
as the existing ones.
The diesel hydrotreater
A new hydrotreater of 9,000 BPSD will be designed to cater for the additional gas
oil from the thermal cracker. The new total amount of gas oil to be treated is 4,894BPCD +7,851 BPCD =12,745 BPCD. There is 706 BPCD spare capacity in the
existing hydrotreater through improved catalyst and service factor. Taking this intoconsideration with a service factor of 80% then the additional capacity required willbe 9,000 BPSD.
Operating costs
The following tables (Tables 17.1.5 and 17.1.6) give approximate factors for utilities"
"and labor for some reﬁnery plants. Note the use of these is acceptable for the screeninganalysis given here. For detailed economic analysis of the selected conﬁguration amore accurate operating costs using certiﬁed vendor and licensor data must be used.
Looking at the conﬁguration under study here, the operating cost for the extension of
the reﬁnery is as follows:
Total cost of utilities per stream year using 0.86 ave service factor
=28,227 $/day ×.86×365=8.840 mm $/year
Labor salaries at 15 $/hr =15×8×4×185 hr/month ×1.4.

Notes on labor:
1. The salaries are increased by 40% to take up government beneﬁts, paid days off,
vacation etc.
2. There are four shifts three on duty and one off every 24 hr.
3. Hours worked per person per month is 185 hr.
Then total labor cost per year =124,320 $/month ×12
=1.491 mm $/year.
Total operating cost per year =10.331 mm $.
Investment costs for the new facilities
There are two costs which make up the overall investment outlay. These are:
rCapital cost of the plant
rAssociated costs
The capital cost
For the screening study a capital cost of plant estimated on experience and factorsare used. This and other types of estimates are described later in this chapter. A setof capacity cost data for plants of this size are listed below:- Note that these numbersare pure ﬁction and bear no relationship to any company’ s cost data.

Thermal crackers 2,000 $/BPD
Fluid catalytic crackers 3,960 $/BPDVacuum distillation units 700 $/BPD
Associated costs
To complete the full investment picture the following costs must be included as partof the investment. These are:
rCost of ﬁrst catalyst and chemical inventory.
rCost of licensing fees for proprietary processes.
rCost of additional utility and offsite facilities. This cost is included because addi-tional processing plants will either require additions to utilities & offsite facilitiesor take up available spare capacity. This will result at some future date an expansionto these facilities which would not be necessary if this process expansion had notoccurred.
For the purpose of a screening study a ﬁgure of 15% of the capital cost is used forthese associated costs. In more deﬁnitive studies this item would be developed withmore detail.
The capital cost of the process expansion considered here is as follows:

Depreciation
In the economic analysis of the various processes the depreciation of the plant value
must be taken into account. Details of depreciation will be described and discussedlater in this chapter. For the purpose of the screening study the following depreciationfactors may be used:
Crude distillation units 6.6% of capital cost per year
Cracking units 6.6% of capital cost per yearLight end units & gas plants 5.0% of capital cost per yearHydrotreaters 6.0% of capital cost per year

Preparing more accurate cost data
Once a selected conﬁguration or study case or cases have been selected from the
screening study it is now necessary to ﬁrm up as much as possible the cost data usedin those studies. Three items of data fall into this category. These are:
rThe capital cost estimate
rThe associated costs
rThe operating cost
Development engineers supply the basic data from which an update can be arrivedat. This level of data is arrived at from a process design of the facilities makingup the case studies. The process design will include a material balance and a ﬁrmprocess ﬂow sheet. Sufﬁcient data will be generated for all equipment to allow man-ufacturers to give a good and realistic equipment budget cost. Where applicable toothe manufacturers will be requested to provide equipment efﬁciencies from whichutility usage for the various items can be calculated. Where options exist withinthe process design itself these will be optimized for equipment sizing and layout.An example of such an optimization is the case of the process heat exchange sys-tem. Full and complete equipment data sheets need not necessarily be developed forthis part of the study. Usually manufacturers are able to provide good budget costsfrom equipment summary sheets similar to those given in the Example Calculationbelow.
Where licensed processes are included in the case study the Development Engineer
will need to develop a speciﬁcation to a suitable licensor soliciting:
rA budget estimate for the plant (installed)
rThe utility requirements and the operating cost(Note: In the case of a catalytic process part of the operating cost will be the catalyst
usage or loss in operation.)
rFirst inventory of catalyst or chemicals where applicable
rThe licensing fee"
"The speciﬁcation must include the capacity of the plant and the required productquality. It must also of course give the licensor(s) details of the feedstock, utilitiesconditions, and in most cases local climatic conditions. The additional informationconcerning feed and product pricing together with utilities costs will enable the li-censor to respond with a ﬁrmer and optimized cost data.768 CHAPTER 17

The following example follows the study screening given in Item 2.0 above.
Example calculation
From the screening study the new plants included in the selected case (which was
case 1) were as follows:
rNaphtha hydrotreater (13,500 BPSD) licensed
rNaphtha splitter (13,500 BPSD)
rCatalytic reformer (9,000 BPSD) licensed
rDe-propaniser (3,830 BPSD) and de-ethanizer (2,176 BPSD)
rDiesel hydrotreater (9,000 BPSD) licensed
rThermal cracker (34,320 BPSD)
The existing debutanizer is to be revamped and a new sized equipment list will beprepared for this unit.
The units of normally licensed processes are indicated as such in the above list.
The thermal cracker may be licensed or can be designed by some major engineeringcompanies as a nonproprietary process. It is a major item of cost and for this examplethe degree of process engineering required at this stage of the study is demonstratedfor this unit.
The process design of the thermal cracker
The process ﬂow sheet for this unit is given in Figure 17.1.6. This process ﬂow sheet
contains the overall material balance for the unit together with the calculated reﬂux andquench ﬂows. Major process stream routes are shown with stream temperatures whereappropriate. The material balance table also gives the ﬂow conditions (temperatureand pressure) for those major streams. The pump capacities are shown on the ﬂowsheet next to the respective pump. These quantities are ﬂows in gallon per minute atthe pump temperature.
The major item in a thermal cracker is the furnace or heater. This has two duties,
the ﬁrst being to heat the feed to its reaction temperature and the second to maintainthe feed at its reaction temperature for the prescribed period of time. Note thereforethat the duty of this heater is shown on the ﬂow sheet as the duty to heating theoil (which also includes the steam in this case) and the duty to supply the heat ofreaction.
Data for the remainder of the equipment are given in Tables 17.1.9, 17.1.10, and
17.1.11. Sufﬁcient data for obtaining a cost and efﬁciency for the heater is providedi na“ Process Speciﬁcation”shown in Table 17.1.12. A special speciﬁcation sheetECONOMICS 771

Capital cost estimates
Capital cost estimates are usually prepared by specialist engineers who are fully
conversant with their company’ s estimating procedures and their company’ s material
and labor cost records. Reﬁnery development engineers are involved in cost estimatingonly so far as they develop and provide the basic technical data that is used to preparethe capital cost of a plant or process. To execute this part of their duty properlydevelopment engineers should know a little about cost estimates and the signiﬁcanceof the various items included in them. This section therefore sets out to deﬁne in broadterms the various levels of estimating, their degree of accuracy, and the scope of theengineering development that is required for each of them.
The accuracy of cost estimates will vary between that based on comparing similar
plants or processes on a capacity basis to the actual cost of a plant when all the billshave been paid and the plant is operational. Obviously the accuracy based on similarityof the process or plant is very low while that based on project end cost must be 100%.That is it is no longer an estimate but is now a fact. In between these two levels howeverestimates may be prepared giving increasing degree of accuracy as engineering andconstruction of the process advances. The accuracy of estimates are enhanced as moreand more money is committed to the project. The progress of a project uses milestonecost estimates coupled with completion schedules for its measurement and control.In the life of a construction project therefore about four “ control estimates” may bedeveloped. For want of better terms these may be referred to as:
rThe capacity factored estimate
rThe equipment factored estimate
rThe semi deﬁnitive estimate
rThe deﬁnitive estimate"
"Companies have their own terms for these estimates but the important point is todevelop these estimates at a time in the project when they can be most useful and776 CHAPTER 17
when sufﬁcient information is available for their best accuracy. Figure 17.1.7 shows
typical phases of a project when these estimates may be best developed.
The following paragraphs now describe these estimates in more detail and emphasize
the process engineer’ s input.
The capacity factored estimateIn most process studies this is the ﬁrst estimate to be prepared. It is the one that
requires the minimum amount of engineering but is the least accurate. This is becausethe plant that is used to factor from will not exactly match the plant in question. It isgood enough however when comparing different processes where the estimates areon the same basis.
Past installed costs of similar plants (deﬁnitive estimate) are used coupled with some
experienced factors to arrive at this type of estimate. The cost of a higher or lowercapacity plant is obtained from the equation:
C=K(A/B)
b
where
C=cost of the plant in question.
K=known cost of a similar plant of size B.
A=is the capacity of the plant in question (usually in vol/unit time).
B=capacity of known plant.
b=is an exponential factor ranging between 0.5 and 0.8.
The estimator’ s experience and records of the type of plant determines the exponentto be used. Usually this is 0.6; a listing of these factors are given in Appendix 17.7.Table 17.1.14 shows an example of a capacity factored estimate for the thermalcracking unit used in Item 3 above.
In this example the direct ﬁeld cost is used as the cost ﬁgure to be capacity factored.
This allows the cost estimator to adjust between the direct ﬁeld cost and the total costusing current experience for ﬁeld indirects, ofﬁce costs, escalation and contingencies.In this case a multiplier of 1.5 times the direct ﬁeld cost is used to collect theseitems.
The equipment factored estimateThis estimate requires a substantial amount of process engineering to deﬁne the
speciﬁc plant or process that is to be estimated. Brieﬂy the following process activityis required:0

rA detailed narrative giving a process description and discussion. (This will be re-
quired for the management review and approval of the Estimate.)
This estimate is normally developed by the process engineer and the cost estimatoronly. There may be some participation from equipment vendors and licensors in theECONOMICS 779
case of licensed processes. There is seldom any further input required from other
engineering disciplines for this level of estimating.
The equipment summary process data sheets and any process speciﬁcations that may
be required are used to solicit equipment prices from pre selected vendors. In additionto the pricing data that will be used for the estimate development vendors should alsobe asked for delivery time required, and sufﬁcient details to enable the operating costof the item to be calculated. The delivery time required is important to managementto establish a project schedule and life span for the engineering and construction ofthe facilities. Later process engineers will also require this schedule to develop cashﬂow curves and data.
On receipt of the vendor’ s pricing data the cost estimator will apply factors to each
of the equipment account data to arrive at a Direct Field Cost for each group ofequipment. This factored cost will be the multiplier of the equipment price which willinclude the materials and labor to actually install those items on site. In Table 17.1.16this factor is shown as a composite for the whole equipment prices to direct ﬁeld cost."
"In this case the ﬁgure developed was a multiplier of 2.5. These factors are proprietaryto respective companies but most major companies do have the statistics to developtheir own factors.
The total cost is again obtained by factoring the DFC (direct ﬁeld cost) as in the
previous ‘ Capacity Factored’Estimate. Note in the case of this example of an equip-ment factored estimate a factor of 1.53 has been used slightly higher than that inTable 17.1.14. This is to account for the ﬁeld erection of the heater, which was notknown previously. This would impact on future home ofﬁce engineering and ﬁeldindirects to some extent (Table 17.1.15).
The semi-deﬁnitive and the deﬁnitive cost estimates
It is not proposed to describe these two estimates in detail here. Sufﬁcient to say that
these estimates will include input from all engineering disciplines that are involved inthe engineering and construction of the plant or process. Indeed after the equipmentfactored estimate the input from process engineers is merely updates of the processdesign as it develops. However, Tables 17.1.16 and 17.1.17 shows the increasingamount of actual data as opposed to factored data that is included in these two esti-mates.
The numbers for these estimates are not included in these tables but the crosshatched
items show where normally ﬁrm cost data would be included. The factored data arealso indicated for both tables.780 CHAPTER 17

Although major manufacturing companies such as large oil companies and chemical
companies have sufﬁcient statistical data to develop semi deﬁnitive and deﬁnitiveestimates these are normally left to the engineering and construction companies. Thesecompanies develop the estimates and use them during the course of the installationproject as cost control tools for project management.
Accuracies of estimates and contingencies
For an estimate to be a meaningful basis of a process study its accuracy needs to be es-
tablished and sufﬁcient contingency be added to make the ﬁnal cost ﬁgure as realisticECONOMICS 781

as possible. Unfortunately this is easier said than accomplished. Most companies
have however developed analysis programs to meet this requirement and many ofthese are quite sophisticated. Engineering and Construction companies whose dailywork depend on good cost estimates for project control are among the front runnersin this exercise. Most of these programs revolve around principles of Risk Analysis.Figure 17.1.8 has been developed from a collection of statistical values over a longperiod of time and does provide some quick guidance to judging accuracy of the esti-mates and then setting a contingency value. Detailed software packages are availablethat can provide reasonable estimates, subject to the quality of the inputs.782 CHAPTER 17

Figure 17.1.8 shows two sets of curves. The ﬁrst is a positive to negative range of accu-
racy against the type of estimate. This type of estimate scale is based on Figure 17.1.7as the progress of the project. Thus, the widest accuracy range is for a capacity factoredestimate at the beginning of a project. The narrowest range therefore is at deﬁnitiveestimate stage around 30–40% of project duration.

Discounted cash ﬂow and economic analysis
Throughout this chapter a major role of a process engineer in conducting economic
studies has been described and discussed. The purpose of these studies is to providethe company’ s management with sound technical data to enable them to improve thecompany’ s proﬁtability at minimum ﬁnancial risk to the company. Up to now thecourse of these studies have covered
rIdentifying the viable options that will meet the study objectives
rShort listing and screening the options using simple return on investment techniques
rProviding process input into the preparation of a more detailed capital cost estimateof those options selected for further detailed economic evaluation
The cost estimates based on ﬁrm equipment costs are the most accurate possible with-out committing to more detail design and capital expenditure. Using these estimatesthe detailed and more reliable prediction of the proﬁtability of the selected optionscan now proceed. This prediction is based on a Return on Investment calculated froma projected cash ﬂow of the process over a prescribed economic life for the facility.
There are several methods of assessing proﬁtability based on Discounted Cash Flow
(DCF), but one such method is a return on investment method using the present worth(or net present value) concept. This concept equates the present value of a future cashﬂow as a product of the present interest value factor and the future cash ﬂow. Based
on this concept, the Return on Investment is that Interest value or Discount Factorwhich forces the Cumulative Present Worth value to Zero over the economic life of theproject. Other methods are described and discussed in Chapter 17.2 which follows.
Whereas the development of capital cost of plants is usually a combined effort betweenthe Development engineer and cost estimator so is the development of a DCF return oninvestment a combined effort between the Development engineer and the company’ sFinance specialist. The development engineer provides the technical input to thework such as operating costs, type of plants, construction schedules and cost, yieldand reﬁnery fence product prices, and the like. While the ﬁnancial specialist providesthe ﬁnancial data based on statutory and company policies, such as the form ofdepreciation, tax exemptions, tax credits (if any), items forming part of the company’ sﬁnancial strategy, etc. The calculation itself is in two parts, which are:
rCalculation of cash ﬂow
rPresent worth calculation
These are described in the following paragraphs.
Calculating cash ﬂow
Figure 17.1.9 gives a graph of the cumulative cash ﬂow of a typical project in relation
to its project life.ECONOMICS 785
Figure 17.1.9. A diagram of cumulative cash ﬂow.
Initially there is a ﬁnancial loss when the company has to purchase land, equipment,
pay contractors to erect equipment, and the like. To do this not unlike most privateindividuals, companies borrow money, on which of coarse they have to pay interest.In addition to the cost of construction the company must keep in hand some capitalby which it can buy feedstock, chemicals, and pay the salary of its staff during thecommissioning of the plant. This working capital must also be considered as debt atthe project initiation.
At the end of construction and commissioning the cash ﬂow into the system moves
upward toward a positive value and after a prescribed number of years moves into apositive value. During this period of positive cash ﬂow the money recovered from theoperation must be sufﬁcient to:
rRepay the loan and its interest
rPay all associated taxes
rPay all the operating costs of the project"
"rMake an acceptable proﬁt786 CHAPTER 17
When these conditions have been met over the prescribed period of time called the
“ Earning Life” or “ Economic Life” , there still remains the plant hardware, the land,and the working capital. These are considered as the projects terminal investment andare added to the ﬁnal project’ s net cost recovery.
The cash ﬂow calculation recognizes the ﬁnancial milestones shown in Figure 17.1.9
and the contents of a typical cash ﬂow calculation are discussed below:
Economic life of the project
This is the number of years over which the project is expected to yield the projectedproﬁt and pay for its installation. These are the number of years starting at year 0which indicates the end of construction and the commissioning of the facilities. Thelast year (usually year 10) is the year in which all loans and other project costs arerepaid and the “ Terminal Investment” released.
Construction period
This is the period before year 0 during which the plant is constructed and commis-sioned. Assume this period is three years then this is designated as end of year −2,−1,
0. During this period the construction company will receive incremental paymentsof the total capital cost of the plant with ﬁnal payment at the end of year 0. Theconstruction cost may be paid from the company’ s equity alone or from equity andan agreed loan or entirely from a loan. In the case of a loan to satisfy this debt thepayment of the loan interest commences in this period. The interest payment over thisperiod however is usually capitalized and paid over the economic life of the project.
Net investment
The net investment for the project includes the capital cost of the plant, which is subjectto depreciation, and the associated costs, which are not subject to depreciation. Thecapital cost of the plant is the contractor’ s selling price for the engineering, equipment,materials and the construction of the facilities. In a process study using a DCF returnon investment calculation the capital cost should be an estimate with an accuracy atleast that based on an equipment factored type.
The associated costs include the following elements:
rAny licensor’ s paid up royalties
rCost of land
rFirst inventory of chemicals and catalyst
rCost of any additional utilities or offsite facilities incurred by the project
rChange in feed and product inventory
rWorking capital
rCapitalized construction period loan interestECONOMICS 787
Revenue
This is the single source of income into the project. In most cases it is the incomereceived for the sale of the product(s). This is calculated from projected processyields of products multiplied by the marketed price of the products. A market surveyshould already have been completed to ensure that the additional products generatedby the project are in demand and the price is in an acceptable range. Later a sensitivityanalysis of the DCF return on investment may be conducted changing the revenuerecovered by price escalation or other means.
Expenses
This is the major cost of carrying out the project. It consists of the following items:
rPlant operating cost. This includes the cost of utilities used in the process, such aspower, steam, and fuel. It also includes the cost of plant person in salaries, burdens,and indirects and the cost of chemicals and catalyst used.
rMaintenance. There are two kinds of maintenance cost included in this item. Theseare the preventive maintenance carried out on a routine basis, and those costsassociated with incidental breakdowns and repair.
rLoan repayment. The loan principle is paid back in equal increments over the
economic life of the plant. This item includes the payback increments and theassociated interest on a declining basis.
These are incurred running costs and as such are considered tax free.
Depreciation
The second cost to the project which is considered as a deductible from the grossproﬁt for tax purposes is the depreciation of the plant value. This is calculated overthe PLANT LIFE as the plant capital cost divided by the plant life. The term Plant Lifeis the predicted life of the facility before it has to be dismantled and sold for scrap.Usually this is set at 20 years and indeed all speciﬁcations relating to Engineering andDesign of the facilities will carry this requirement. So that all material and designcriteria such as corrosion allowances associated with the plant will meet this plantlife parameter.
Ad valorem tax
This is the ﬁxed tax levied in most countries payable to local municipal authorities,provincial, or state authorities to cover property tax, municipal service costs etc.
Taxable income
Taxable income is revenue less operating cost, depreciation, and Ad Valorem Tax.This of course is simply put as in most countries, States, or Provinces there willprobably be certain local tax relief principles and tax credits that will affect the ﬁnal788 CHAPTER 17
taxable income ﬁgure. The company’ s ﬁnancial specialist will be in the position to"
"apply these where necessary.
Tax
This is quite simply the tax rate applied to the “ Taxable Income” ﬁgure. This will varyfrom location to location but will be taken as one rate over the economic life of theproject for the purpose of a process study, unless there are legislative changes alreadyin place.
Proﬁt after tax
This is the gross proﬁt less the tax calculated in the previous item.
Net cash ﬂow
This item is calculated for each year of the project’ s economic life. It commenceswith year 0 with the net investment shown as a negative net cash ﬂow item. Then foreach successive year until the end of the last year of the economic life, the net cashﬂow is calculated as the sum of proﬁt after tax PLUS the depreciation.
The depreciation is added here because it is not really a cost to the project. It is a
“ Book” cost only and is used speciﬁcally for tax calculation. The cash ﬂow item forthe last year of the economic life must now include the “ Terminal Investment Item” .This item is the sum of the salvage or net scrap value of the plant (scrap value lesscost of dismantling), the estimated value of the land and the Working Capital initiallyused as part of the “ Associated Costs” .
Thus the ﬁnal cash ﬂow item will be the sum of proﬁt after tax, plus depreciation,
plus terminal investment.
With the net cash ﬂow in place the second part of the calculation which is the de-
termination of the return on investment based on the present worth concept for theproject can be carried out.
Calculating the cumulative present worthThis is an iterative calculation using three or more values as the discounting per-
centage. The result of the cumulative values of the present worth at the end of theeconomic life from these calculations are plotted against the discount percentagesused for each case. The discount value when the cumulative present worth is zero isthe return on investment for the project.
For each value of the discount percentages selected ﬁrst calculate the discount factor
for each year of the economic life starting at year 0 where the discount factor isalways 1.0. Then divide the discount factor for year 0 which is 1.0 by (1.0 +d) whereECONOMICS 789
d=discount percent divided by 100. Do the same for each successive year. Thus, if
the discount percent selected is 10% then the discount factor for year 0 =1.0, for year
1=1/1.1=0.909, and for year 2 =0.909/1.1 =0.826, and for year 3 =0.826/1.1 =
0.751, and so on until the last year.
The present worth value for each year is then calculated as the net cash ﬂow value
for that year multiplied by the discount factor for that year. Remember the cash ﬂowvalue for year 0 is always negative. Next determine the cumulative present worthvalue by adding the value for each successive year to the value of the year before.Starting with that value for year 0 which is negative add that value for year 1 whichis positive to give a positive or negative cumulative value for year 1. Continue byadding the present worth value for year 2 to the cumulative value for year 1 to givethe cumulative value for year 2, and so on through the last year. The cumulative valueof the present worth for the last year in each of the discount percentages selectedis plotted linearly against the discount percentage. This cumulative value can eitherbe positive or negative. Indeed to be meaningful the discount percentages selectedmust be such that the calculated present worth values for the last economic years be amixture of negative and positive values. In this way the resulting curve plotted mustpass through zero.
The following example calculation is based on Scheme 1 in Item 8.2. Similar cal-
culations may also be carried out on one or more of the other schemes that werescreened to conﬁrm their comparative proﬁtability. In this case, it is important toremember that the economic parameters used for each case are identical to enable aproper comparison and analysis to be made.
Example calculation
This scheme includes the addition of the following units into an existing oil re-
ﬁnery.
rNew naphtha hydrotreater (13,500 BPSD)
rNew naphtha splitter (1,350 BPSD)
rRevamped debutanizer and new light end units (3,830 BPSD)
rNew thermal cracker (34,320 BPSD)
rNew diesel hydrotreater (9,000 BPSD)
rNew catalytic reformer (9,000 BPSD)
The capacity factored capital cost estimate used in the screening studies for thisscheme was 125.490 mm $. A subsequent estimate based on a more deﬁnitive designand equipment deﬁnition (equipment factored estimate) gave a capital cost ﬁgure of119.216 mm $ for this conﬁguration. This latter ﬁgure will be used as the capital costin this example calculation.790 CHAPTER 17

Associated costs
1.0 Paid up royalties. This is a once off licensing fee paid to the licensors of the

"a running licensing fee for these processes, but this will be included into theoperating cost.Paid up royalties =2.026 mm $.
2.0 First catalyst inventory =4.052 mm $.
3.0 Cost of land =1.0 mm $.
4.0 Cost of incremental utility / offsite facilities =2.501 mm $.
5.0 Cost of increased product / feed inventory (only product inventory is considered
here as there is no change in crude oil throughput). Statutory requirements forthis reﬁnery location is a mandatory inventory of 14 days feed and product.Additional inventory cost =14×((564,845 +162,798) −(452,756))
=3.848 mm $. (see this chapter Item 2)

Operating labor =1.49
Utilities =8.32
Chemicals, catalyst, running royalties =1.20
Total =11.01
Operating costs escalate at a rate of 3.0% per year. The yearly operating cost schedule
is given in Table 17.1.18.
The maintenance cost for year 1 is taken as 4% of capital cost which is 0.04 ×
119.216 =4.76 mm $. Maintenance costs are escalated at a rate of 1.0% per year.
The annual schedule for this item is also given in Table 17.1.18.
Loan repayments and interest
The total loan for the project is 55.390 mm $ and is repaid over 10 years at an interestrate of 8.0% per annum discounted annually.
The schedule of repayments and interest is given in Table 17.1.19 assuming uniform
returns in principal.
Revenue
There is a single source of revenue which is from the sale of all products at the reﬁneryprice given in Item 2 of this section of the chapter. For the base case given in thisexample there is no escalation of this ﬁgure which remains at 77.7 mm $ per year.
Sensitivity analysis performed later gives the change in ROI for escalated product
pricing of 3% and 4% per year, respectively.792 CHAPTER 17

Depreciation
Depreciation is normally the capital cost of the plant divided by the plant life. Theplant life in this example is 20 years but the capital cost in this case has been taken asthe original capacity factored estimate of 125.490 mm $. This allows for such items inthe associated costs such as the precious metal content of catalysts which are subject todepreciation. For this example therefore depreciation is taken as 7.7 mm $ per yearthroughout.
Ad V alorem Tax
This item includes plant insurance and is set at 2.0% of capital cost per year.
Tax
This is 40% of taxable income. For the purpose of this study it is assumed there areno tax credits.

Consolidation of the net cash ﬂow is given in Table 17.1.21.Figure 17.1.10 gives a plot of the cumulative net present worth versus percent discount
from the results of the calculations given in Table 17.1.22.
From Figure 17.1.9 the DCF return on investment for this scheme is 20.5% per
year. Based on the plant location and the current investment environment Returnon Investment above 18% DCF makes the venture economically attractive. Similarcalculations for scheme 3 will also be conducted to verify its ROI on a DCF basis forcomparison with scheme 1.
The sensitivity of scheme 1 to escalation of reﬁnery fence product costs are as follows:
rAt an escalation rate of 3.0% per year the ROI becomes 23.5%

Using linear programs to optimize process conﬁgurations
Linear programming is a technique to solve complex problems having multi variable
conditions by the use of linear equations. The equations are developed to deﬁnethe inter relationship of the variables. Computers are used to solve these equationsand to select from a matrix of these equations the solution or solutions to the pro-blem.
This is not a new technique. It has been used for many years in industry and particularly
the oil industry to plan and optimize its operation. Indeed in oil reﬁning today thereis considerable development in process control using linear programming “ on line”to optimize the units operation. In its use as a management tool it can reﬁne thecalculations described in item 8.2 to a very ﬁne degree. It is possible also by usingthis technique to examine many more options than could be examined in a manualoperation.ECONOMICS 795

The ﬁrst objective using this technique is to build a mathematical model that fully
deﬁnes the problem. The main model constitutes the “ objective function.” The purposeof linear programming is to either maximize or minimize the objective function (e.g.,maximize overall proﬁt or minimize overall costs) subject to a number of constraints.The model itself will consist of many submodels which will be inter-related by linearequations. In the case of an oil reﬁnery conﬁguration study the data for the modeldevelopment will include:
rAll the processing plants to be considered
rThe yield from each plant
rThe product and feed stream properties
rAll the possible routing of the streams
rAll the possible ﬁnal blending recipes
rUtility and operating requirements for each process on a unit throughput basis
rInvestment cost for each process
These data are coded and the coded items used in equations that represent allthe relationships to one another. The coded data items are shown graphically inFigure 17.1.11. The relationship equations representing physical and ﬁnancial dataare input to the computer program. Proprietary sub routines included in the programresolve nonlinear relationships to linear. Such routines as the DCF calculation are796 CHAPTER 17

also added into the main program. The computer solves the many hundreds of equa-"
"tions meeting the problem premises and any other applied constraints. The selectedconﬁgurations are optimized within the program and the ﬁnal printout shows productquantities, product quality, stream ﬂows, unit capacities, investment costs, operatingcost, and the ROI. The graphical representation of the model, part of which is shownhere as Figure 17.1.11, contains 511 variables and over 400 equations. By presentlinear program standards this is a family small model.
17.1.3 Executing an approved project
This part of the chapter deals with the activities that are carried out by the reﬁnery in
installing a new or revamped facility which has been approved by the mechanism de-ﬁned in Part 2 of this Chapter. Much of the initial work is carried out by the company’ sdevelopment engineers. Later, during the early part of the work being executed in aselected engineering ofﬁce, the company will set up a project team headed by a projectmanager to monitor and oversee that the company’ s interests and requirements are met.
Developing the duty speciﬁcation
Among the ﬁrst activities to initiate a reﬁnery project is the development of the “ Project
Duty Speciﬁcation” . The process major input to this most important document issupplied by the company’ s process development engineers.
As soon as a project and the funds have been approved for implementation work must
begin to appoint an engineering and construction contractor to do the work. Beforethis can be accomplished however it is necessary to complete the following:
1.0 Prepare the duty speciﬁcation for the plant.
2.0 Develop the contractor’ s scope of work.3.0 Develop the contractual terms and the contract itself.4.0 Assemble the document inviting contractor bids.5.0 Decide on the selection procedure for the contractor appointment.
Normally the operating company will assemble a team of people who will be
dedicated to carry out these activities. This team will usually be headed by a memberof the company’ s middle management who will be responsible for these precontractactivities. The team itself will consist of senior personnel from its engineeringdisciplines, and other parties such as the company’ s purchasing and legal departments.
The development engineer will almost invariably participate in some or all of the ac-
tivities listed above. His/her main participation however will be in the development ofthe duty speciﬁcation. The importance of this document is that it forms the basis of the800 CHAPTER 17
selected contractor’ s scope of work. It also establishes the standard of quality required
by the operating company as the client. A well drafted project duty speciﬁcation willcontain at least the following sections and information:
rThe process speciﬁcation
rGeneral design criteria
rAny preliminary ﬂow sheets (duly labeled “ Preliminary” )
rUtilities speciﬁcation
rBasis for economic evaluations
rMaterials of construction
rEquipment standards required
rInstrument standards required
These are now discussed in the following paragraphs:
The process speciﬁcation
This document is developed entirely by the senior development engineer assigned to
the project team. It gives in precise terms, the plant required, the number of units,its throughput, the product yields and quality, the required test standards, and anysalient process requirements. An example of a typical process speciﬁcation is givenin Appendix 17.8.
General design criteria
This section of the project duty speciﬁcation is usually compiled by the reﬁnery’ s
project engineers assigned to the team. Some input is required from the developmentengineer to ensure that technical documents and data developed by others will conformwith the company’ s usual format. This section, as the name implies, supplies thegeneral data associated with any work done in the company’ s plant site. The followingtopics make up this section:
Scope
This is a brief statement covering the objective of the project. This is followed by alist of the company’ s standards that are to be used in the implementation of the work.
Climatic data
A list of the following data is given here. These are the data that will be used in thevarious speciﬁcations and calculations developed during the course of the project:
rDry and wet bulb temperatures
rWinter design dry bulb temperature
rTemperature extremes
rBarometric pressureECONOMICS 801
General design considerations
This section lists allof the legislative criteria associated with the building of an
industrial plant in the area. It will include the environmental requirements, and safetyand quality standards to be adhered to by contractors and licensor.
Units of measurement
The units of measurement that will be used in all calculations, ﬂow sheets, andspeciﬁcations are given in this item. It begins by stating the units in terms of:
rEnglish units
ror SI units
ror any others
The next section then deﬁnes these units in more detail such as for example:
Linear— Millimeters (mm)"
"Mass— Kilograms (kg)Flow gas— Normal cubic meters per hour (Nm
3/h).
Flow liquid— (large) cubic meters per hour (m3/hr).
— (small) liters per minute (l/min).
There follows then a list of conversion units that should be used on the project.
Engineering flow diagrams
Many companies include those ﬂow diagrams they have developed during the ap-propriation stage of the project. These are usually the process ﬂow diagram and themechanical ﬂow diagram. The inclusion of these adds to the description of the workscope by supporting the process speciﬁcation. In most contracts however the clientcompany will expect the contractor and/or the licensor to take responsibility for theprocess performance and to guarantee it. Under this circumstance these engineeringdiagrams are released into the project duty speciﬁcation as “ Preliminary” issues. Thecontractor is expected to check and, if necessary, revise them. Thereafter, the contrac-tor must accept responsibility for the technical content of the diagrams as a basis forfuture normal design development.
Utilities speciﬁcation
Full details of the utility streams available in the clients plant is given in this item. Thisitem is generally prepared by the process engineers and must include data concerningall steam and condensate systems, water systems, air, and fuel. Such data will includeat least the temperature and pressure of these streams. In the case of circulatingsystems such as fuel oil and cooling water both supply and return conditions will berequired. Raw water available should also have a complete analysis of its impurities.The analysis of the normal fuel oil and fuel gas should be included. These wouldcontain at least the following:802 CHAPTER 17
Fuel oil: Supply temperature.
Sg @ supply temp
Visc @ 120◦Fc s
Visc @ 210◦Fc s
Supply and return pressure.
Fuel gas: Supply temperature and pressure.
Molecular weight.
Approximate molar analysis.
The dew point of instrument air required at the air supply header must be stated. If the
client has any preference as to the type of desiccant to be used in the drying of the airthis too must be stated.
All other preferences or standards that the client company requires to be utilized in
the utilities design must be given in this section. For example most companies havea standard burner control system for their plants. This should be fully described heretogether with some appropriate sketches.
The electrical engineers usually add details of the plant power supply and distribution
in this section. If some existing switch boards and substations are to be utilized thisshould be noted together with a list of drawings that should be referenced.
Other systems, although not strictly utilities, may be included here. Among these
would be:
rThe ﬁre main
rThe ﬂare(s)
rWater efﬂuent treating and disposal
rOther environmental protection systems
rBoiler blow-down systems
Basis for economic evaluationsThe process engineer completes this section with the criteria used in the evaluationstudies and the appropriation design. The section should begin with a statement thatcontractors are encouraged to review all ﬂow and equipment arrangements so thatall possible alternatives are considered. The incremental cost of any alternative ar-rangements must however yield a minimum of the company’ s stipulated return oninvestment. This return on investment is stated here.
This section continues with the detail costs of labor, utilities, feedstock, and products
to be used for any such economic analysis.ECONOMICS 803
Materials of construction
This section is usually compiled by the team’ s project engineers with some input bythe process engineers. It should begin with a paragraph on the references to be usedin selecting the materials used in handling the corrosive streams. For example:
rSelection of steels exposed to hydrogen service shall be based on “ API-941.”
rCorrosion allowances for steels subject to hydrogen sulﬁde environment shall be inaccordance with “ Computer correlations to estimate corrosion of steels” by Couperand Gorman, NACE paper No 67.
The next paragraph or sub section should detail the client’ s requirement for corrosionallowances in terms of equipment life. For example:
Equipment Life in years
Columns, drums, and reactors 20
Heat exchanger-shell 20Heat exchanger-tubes 5
Pumps 10
Compressors 10
Heater tubes 100,000 hours.
Atmospheric tankage 20Piping material 10
These data may also be supplemented by a table giving the company’ s acceptedminimum corrosion allowance in mm or ins (mils) for the various equipment items.
Equipment standards to be used for sizing and design
There follows in this section data to be used for the sizing and the specifying of themajor equipment items, which are:
rVessels and columns
rHeat exchangers
rPumps
rCompressors
rHeaters
Examples of such data included in this section are as follows:

Coil design temperature and pressure criteria
Fuel system details (company standard)Burner types preferred and burner control (company standards)
Instrument standards required
This section of the speciﬁcation is usually compiled by the instrument and the pro-cess engineers. Its objective is to convey to the contractors the instrument, safety,and control philosophy required for the company’ s plants. It may begin with the siz-ing criteria for control and relief valves that the company wishes to use. For ex-ample:
rCriteria to set the control valve pressure drop asa%o fline losses, etc.
rDesign capacities for control valves
rDesign standards required for relief valve sizing (e.g. API-520 and 521)
This item should then continue to deﬁne the company’ s preferences in piping designfor control valve hook-up, relief valve venting, and relief valve locations. Some basiccriteria concerning the relief header and its condition should be described. Finally,the section should give a list of instrument drawing symbols that the company prefers806 CHAPTER 17
or, in the case of a plant being build in an existing complex, the symbols already in
use.
This completes a review of a typical project duty speciﬁcation. This document which
usually forms part of a request for contractor’ s quotes may be smaller and less detailedthan described here. Sometimes the client company may wish to depend solely on thecontractor’ s standards and criteria. However to ensure good competitive quotations adocument such as described here or even more detailed is desirable.
The project team
Immediately after the appropriation approval for a new project the company usually
appoints a Project Manager to look after the execution of the project as a whole. TheProject Manager is chosen from senior engineers in the company. He will be a personwith wide experience in the management of engineering and installation of petroleumreﬁning facilities and ideally very familiar with his company’ s codes and stand-ards.
One of the ﬁrst activities of the Project Manager will be to form a team of experienced
people who will assist him in directing the effort of his company and third parties whowill be engaged in executing the project. In the early stages of the project the team willbe relatively small, consisting of the senior development engineer, a scheduler, anda cost estimator. Later a contracts specialist and legal advisor will join the team ona part time basis. As the project continues with the selection of the engineeringand construction company the team will include additional development/processengineers, procurement or purchasing specialists, and one or more assistant projectengineers. This team will probably move into the contractor’ s ofﬁces, so that a day byday interface with the contractor is established.
At some time soon after the contractor’ s ﬁeld ‘ move in’the company’ s project team"
"will move into the contractor’ s ﬁeld ofﬁces. At this stage of the project the teamstructure will be changed. In all probability the senior Development Engineer andthe assisting process and project engineers will return to their home ofﬁce and willparticipate only in addressing any process problems that may arise. Their place onthe team will be taken up by one or more experienced construction supervisors whowill assist in monitoring progress both with respect to time and to budget during theconstruction period.
Most oil reﬁning companies carry their own commissioning and start-up specialists.
The duty of these specialists commence when the facilities or part of the facilitieshave been declared by the contractor to be complete. Their ﬁrst activity is to checkthe plant out for completeness and that it conforms to the company’ s standards andECONOMICS 807
requirements. In doing this they develop a ‘ Punch List’of those items that do not
conform or require more work. After the contractor has worked through the ‘ Punch
List’ and the work has been accepted the plant is handed over to the ‘ care, custody, andcontrol’of the company. At this point commissioning of the facilities can commencewith the ‘ lead’specialist taking charge. Part of the duties of the commissioningspecialist is to orientate and/or train plant operating personnel to run the facilities.The senior commissioning specialist usually remains on site to monitor the guaranteetest run and interpret its results.
Primary activities of the project team
The function of the project team has been touched on in the last section. The activities
that satisfy these functions are listed as follows:
Pre contract award:
1.0 Preparation of the project speciﬁcation
2.0 Determining the type of contract3.0 Preparing the enquiry document4.0 Issuing the enquiry document5.0 Tender evaluation6.0 Recommendation of the award contract
The ﬁrst of these activities ‘ The preparation of the project speciﬁcation’has already
been discussed at the beginning of the third part of this chapter.
Determining the type of contract
Types of contracts fall into three main categories. These are:
“ Lump Sum” . With this type of contract the contractor undertakes to provide the
complete plant ready for operation for a ﬁxed lump sum of money.
“ Fixed Fee” . Here the contractor undertakes to execute some of the services associated
with the plant installation for a ﬁxed sum of money. All the other costs would bereimbursable at net cost to the contractor. For example: The contract may require thecontractor to ﬁx his ‘ Home Ofﬁce’engineering cost plus his proﬁt fee with all othercosts being reimbursable (this is called an Omnibus Fee contract). Other forms of thistype of contract may require the contractor to ﬁx just his proﬁt fee, or perhaps part ofthe ofﬁce engineering cost.
“ Cost Plus” . In this type of contract the contractor is reimbursed for all costs applicable
to the work plus a percentage of these cots as the contractor’ s proﬁt fee and overheads.808 CHAPTER 17
There are several factors that determine the choice of these types of contracts. Among
the more important of these are the following considerations:
rIs the project subject to process design changes?
rCan the scope of work be accurately deﬁned?
rIs time an essential factor?
rThe current and anticipated trend in material and labor prices
rThe amount of competition among the contracting organizations
A“Lump Sum”contract would be the preferable type of contract if the scope of
work can be accurately described in the project speciﬁcation and it was certain therewould not be any major changes to the process. However, contractors would requirea reasonable time to respond to the request for a “ lump sum”bid. After all theywould require the time to properly analyze the project speciﬁcation, obtain equipmentquotes, make preliminary layouts, design, and material take off for cost estimating.The standard of the cost estimate in this case would need to be at least a semi deﬁnitivetype (see second part of this chapter).
The advantage of “ Lump Sum” contract is that the owner knows from day one the
cost of the project. However, the owner is also faced with the need to closely monitorthe project to ensure the contractor does not effect savings at the expense of qualityto increase his, the contractor’ s, proﬁtability.
Inquiry documents for “ Fixed Fee” contracts can be prepared in a much shorter time
and with less deﬁnition than for “ Lump Sum” contracts. If time is an all importantelement and the project itself is so complicated that even a fairly accurate scope ofwork cannot be made, then a “ Cost Plus” type contract is the more preferable one. Inboth these types of contract the owner has complete control over material and laborcosts. This is a big advantage when material prices and labor costs are falling, but itimposes a signiﬁcant onus on the owner.
The types of contracts described here are the “ basic” types. There are many variations"
"or small changes to these that are often used. For example a contract may call for a“ Cost Plus” up to, say, the stages where a semi deﬁnitive estimate can be developed.It may then require the contract to be converted to “ Lump Sum” for the remainderof the project.
Preparing the enquiry document
“ The Project Speciﬁcation” is the instruction to the contractor as to what facility isrequired to be built and to what standards and codes. The enquiry document mustnow include the exact scope of the work that has to be undertaken by the contractorand what work has to be provided by the owner. It is this scope of work that willbecome the basis for the contractor’ s program and ultimately his master control planECONOMICS 809
for executing the work. It will also be the basis for negotiations with respect to changes
and the cost/schedule implication of such changes.
The next important item in the enquiry document must deﬁne in clear terms the type of
contract. This is most important in the case of “ Fixed Fee” type contract. Contractors’bidding the work must understand fully what is included as a ﬁxed portion and whatis to be reimbursed. As mentioned earlier the contract type may be a variation of thethree major categories discussed earlier. Such terms must be clearly deﬁned and ifchanges are to be made during the project such as conversion to a different type or anaddition of target pricing this too has to be clearly deﬁned. If there is a time elementfor completion a Bonus/Penalty clause is often included.
The enquiry document must include information regarding the procedures to be ad-
hered to during the life of the project and toward the latter part when the plant isconsidered ready for operation. Such instructions, which may affect the contractor’ sbid, are as follows:
rList of approvals required by the owner
rAttendance by the owner for critical reviews and conferences
rCorrespondence and communication to/from the owner
rPreferred vendor’ s list (particularly in the case of “ Lump Sum” contracts)
rGuarantees-process and mechanical
rEnvironmental considerations
rSite data (such as: elevation, location, ambient conditions etc.)
rObtaining licenses to build
rHand over procedures
Finally, the enquiry document gives instructions as to how the contractor’ s bid is tobe submitted. This includes the number of copies required, when and in what formthe bids are presented.
Issuing the enquiry document
Prior to issuing the enquiry document and in the time span in which the documentis compiled, the owner’ s company should review the contractor market. This reviewshould include a limited number of suitable engineering companies. Preparing bidswith the subsequent follow-up work does cost contracting companies a signiﬁcantamount of time and money; therefore the selection of contractors to be invited to bidshould be carefully made.
In this task the ﬁrst question to be resolved is: Which contractors are qualiﬁed to
undertake this work? For example if the project requires engineering, design, andinstallation of a hydrocracker then ideally the qualifying contractor should have in-stalled a hydrocracker or a similarly complex unit before. It would not be appropriate810 CHAPTER 17
for example to solicit a bid from a civil contractor for this kind of project or indeed a
contractor who had only installed smaller petroleum plants.
The next task is to meet with potential contractors at their respective establishments.
The purpose here is to determine the extent of their home ofﬁce facilities for engi-neering and to establish the method they use for executing a project. The other factorduring this meeting would be to determine the spare capacity they had available forundertaking the work and their program for growth or completing their existing ‘ inhouse’work.
Finally and during this meeting at the potential contractors’ofﬁces the owner should
meet the key people they would assign to the project. Certainly meeting the proposedproject manager is a must. In the case of a major reﬁnery project meeting the leadprocess engineer is equally as important. Present day contractor evaluation mustinclude the extent of this company’ s computer applications. This will be a signiﬁcantfactor in selection.
Normally three to four bidders should be selected from this pre enquiry review to
receive the invitation to bid. These selected bidders should be informed by phone orfax and conﬁrmed by letter. In this way the bidders are requested if they are interestedto receive the bid documents and subsequently submit a bid. The bid documents whencomplete should be delivered by hand if possible or by courier at a predetermineddate.
Contractors’ bid evaluation, and recommendation for award"
"The ﬁrst activity after receipt of the bids is to carefully review their contents to ensurethat they comply with the enquiry documents. In the case of Lump Sum bids carefulreview of the equipment offered is made to ensure they meet the owner’ s vendor listand approval. The bids are reviewed regarding the commercial offer. The selection isnever made on price alone but on the complete offer. While the price at ﬁrst glancemay seem very attractive, in some cases an evaluation of the other contractual offermay prove more costly in the end.
In most companies approval of major contracts is made by an executive group or
person. It is usually the duty of the Project Team to compile the bidders’offers intoa succinct form for review by the approval board. The Project Manager of the teamshould include a recommendation for approval in the report to the company’ s approvalexecutive.
A suggested content of a “ Contractors’Bid Summary” for a Lump Sum Contract is
as follows:
Contractor’ s name:ECONOMICS 811
Total price mm $
Engineering $Design $Procurement $HO overheads $
Materials
Equipment $Piping $Instruments $Electrical $Civil Structural $Others $
Construction
Direct ﬁeld costs $Indirect ﬁeld costs $Total construction $
Deviation from the duty speciﬁcation
Compliance with contractual terms.Completion time.
There may be further items depending on the enquiry content.Project manager’ s recommendation
Project manager’ s notes and justiﬁcation.
The bid summary is given top priority and early completion is usually of major
importance. Most bids do carry a limit on the time that the quotes are valid. It is in theowner’ s interest to make the award within those valid dates if possible. Many ownercompanies prefer to short list the bids to two or three and to interview the companiesso listed to discuss their bids before making the ﬁnal selection. This is very usual inthe case of Lump Sum or Fixed Fee type contracts. Such reviews certainly help tominimize “ Change Order” negotiations further down the line.
Monitoring the execution of new projects
Project initiation
As soon as possible after the award of the project the owner’ s project team moves intothe successful contractor’ s ofﬁces. The content and size of the team will vary with thetype of contract and the status of the work in the contractor’ s home ofﬁce. In generalthough the Project Team has more responsibility when administrating a Cost Pluscontract than either of the other two types. The major activities of the team in this812 CHAPTER 17
section of the work refers to those required for the Cost Plus contract. Initially the team
should consist of the Project Manager, the Senior Process or Development Engineer,one or two Project Engineers, possibly a procurement (purchasing) specialist, and aCost/Scheduling engineer. The activities of this team during the initial stages of thework will be:
rConduct the client’ s“kick off” meeting
rReview and approve preliminary schedules and budgets for the project
rReview and comment on the contractors project procedure manual
These are described in some detail in the following paragraphs:
The kick off meetings
One of the most important conferences held during the course of the project life is‘ The kick off’meeting. This takes place as soon as possible after the award of theproject by the client to the contractor. As the name implies this meeting formallyreleases the contractor to begin work on the client’ s plant and describes again in detailthe client’ s requirements. Its purpose is to communicate to the contractor’ s project
team, the scope of work, the time span required, the budget (approximate or ﬁrm), anddetails of quality requirements and speciﬁcations as outlined in the client’ s‘project
speciﬁcation’ . Discussion should then follow on the project management aspect ofthe work. The completion date required for the project is tabled together with majormilestones to be met with during the project life. These milestones usually indicatewhen cost estimates (and schedules) are to be updated or when critical overall projectdecisions are to be made.
This ﬁrst or formal ‘ kick off meeting’conducted usually by the client’ s project man-
ager is invariably followed by a second, less formal, meeting of the contractor’ s projectteam. The client’ s team may or may not be invited to attend this meeting. Howeverat the end of both these kick off meetings each key member of the client’ s and thecontractor’ s project teams should be absolutely sure of what the project requirementsare and what role they are to play in achieving them.
Preliminary schedule and budget"
"Soon after the “ kick off” meetings a preliminary schedule for the engineering workand a budget will be developed by the contractor. The contractor will be able toproduce a fairly accurate schedule for the front end work based on their experience insimilar projects. The remainder of the schedule to ‘ job end’will be far less accurate.Much of this forward scheduling will depend on equipment vendor quotes and ifapplicable licensor data, and later sub contractor quotations. The same applies to theaccuracy of this ﬁrst budget. However, both this schedule and budget will form the ﬁrstcontrol parameter for the project execution plan. On “ Cost Plus” projects the clientsapproval for these items is usually mandatory.ECONOMICS 813
Review and comment on the contractor’ s project procedure manual
Most contractor project managers develop a procedure manual on major projects thatthey work on. This project manual contains details of the particular lists, directoryof the project team, and speciﬁc procedures that will be adopted on the project. Thiseliminates the need for a great number of correspondence deﬁning instructions duringthe course of the project. Although this is contractors internal document the client’ sproject team is always invited to review and often participate in it’ s development.
A typical project procedure manual is divided into several sections. An example of
these sections are as follows:
rIntroduction
rProject organization and directory
rThe master schedule
rMan hour budgets (restricted issue)
rThe cost code of accounts
rProject control procedures
rCorrespondence and communication
rConferences and meetings
rFiling index
rIndividual engineering, procurement and design interface procedures
rDrawing index
rField organization and directory
rHand over procedures, and close out reports
The items given above may be increased or decreased depending on the wishes of thecontractor’ s project manager. After all this is the project manager’ s document althoughit is compiled by the members of the contractor’ s project team. A brief description ofthe contents of some of these sections now follows:
Introduction
This section begins with the general information as to who the client is, the ofﬁcialaddress of the client and the phone, fax, or telex numbers, e-mail address etc. Itcontinues with a short history of the project up to the award, and concludes with asynopsis of the process(es) involved. This section should not be more than three orfour pages in length.
Project organization and directory
The project organization chart for the project, is included in this section. Followingthe chart is a table of the key positions (and those of the client’ s project team) withthe individual’ s name and ofﬁce phone number or extension, and e-mail addresses.814 CHAPTER 17
The master schedule
This is the master schedule in bar chart form which shows the scheduled progressby discipline and activity. Initially and of necessity this will be preliminary but willindicate critical milestone dated clearly. It may be followed by a list of these milestonedates with explanatory notes. This will be subject to updates as the project progresses.
Manhour budgets
This includes the allocated manhour budgets by discipline for the project. This itemis restricted to the copies of the manual issued to key personnel who are responsiblefor their discipline’ s budget control. As in the case of the master schedule, initiallythese manhour estimates will be preliminary, and will be subject to updates as theproject proceeds.
The cost code of accounts
This is a summary of the cost coding that will be used on the project to identify allthe various cost centers. This coding will also be used to identify and code such itemsas purchase orders, client billing, change orders and the like. More often than not thecontractor’ s normal cost codes are used for this purpose.
Project control procedures
This section outlines the reporting procedures the project manager will adopt to controlthe project in terms of progress and budget. It will detail the data required from thekey members of the project and the timing of the data for each reporting period.
Correspondence and communication
All correspondence leaving the project does so under the project manager’ s signature.Similarly all correspondence originating outside the project is addressed to the projectmanager. All correspondence are given a coded reference number and this codedreference number also identiﬁes the origin of the correspondence. This reference codeis given in this section, together with instructions on the routing of the correspondence.Detail procedures as to the communication by other means, such as telephone, e-mail,and fax is also given here. A list giving the required distribution of all correspondenceto the project team personnel and possibly others outside the project is given in thissection.
Conferences and meetings"
"Routine meetings and conferences are scheduled in this section. This will also includea list of permanent attendees to these meetings. As time taken up in meetings is a largeutilizer of manhours, the project manager may elect to outline certain recommendedprocedures for unscheduled meetings in this section. All meetings on the project areminuted, and the minutes distributed within the team and other interested partiesaccording to the project’ s correspondence distribution list.ECONOMICS 815
The ﬁling index
The project secretary organizes the project ﬁling system. The ﬁles generated on theproject often become legal documents which may be used for such purposes as ‘ jobclose out’ negotiations, any possible litigation, or inquiries at later dates into industrialaccidents and the like. Maintaining the ﬁling therefore is an important function on theproject, and to accomplish this effectively a ﬁling index is initiated and developed.This is given in the manual to enable members of the project team to utilize the ﬁleseffectively when required.
Individual engineering, procurement, and design interface procedures
During the life of a project there will a considerable amount of data and informationgenerated and distributed to the various disciplines in the project team. To ensure thecorrect movement of these data etc each discipline develops it’ s interface procedures.For example in the case of a process engineer who has now completed the data sheet fora pump he needs to ensure that this document is sent to the correct discipline for furtherwork and ultimately purchasing. In this particular project the mechanical engineer isdesignated to be the interface between process and the purchasing department. Thenthis section of the procedure manual will detail such interface with instructions ofhow the transmittal of the data sheet is to be done.
Drawing index
This is initiated and maintained by the design coordinator. In developing the index asa list of all the drawings he also demonstrates what the items in the drawing referencenumbers signify. This is updated as the project proceeds.
The remaining items of the manual are self explanatory. These are usually added only
in later editions of the manual. For example just before or immediately after ﬁeld‘ move in’etc.
Monitoring the engineering, procurement, and design phaseWith the project now underway the work continues in the home ofﬁce of the contractor
to detail the engineering of the plants, to purchase the equipment and materials to beinstalled, and to arrange the ‘ lay out’the facility on the site provided by the client.Each of the various disciplines proceed with their function to meet the progressmilestones deﬁned by the ‘ master schedule’ . Some of these milestones are ﬁnalizedby conferences of all the contractor’ s participants and the client’ s project team. Theﬁrst of these, and perhaps the most important is the mechanical ﬂow sheet conference.
The mechanical ﬂow sheet conference and approval
One of the major objectives of the process engineering’ s early activities is to providesufﬁcient data to enable other disciplines to commence effective work as early aspossible. A major milestone in achieving this objective is to conference the MFD816 CHAPTER 17
(mechanical ﬂow diagram) and have it approved by the client. This approval allows
a considerable amount of design work (which is the major man hour user on mostprojects) to commence. The development of the equipment data sheets has alreadyallowed the mechanical engineering and the procurement functions to commencework but it is the release of the approved mechanical ﬂow diagram that really puts theactivities of the project into top gear.
Participation of the client company in the ﬂow sheet conference depends on the type
of contract and the relative location of the client’ s ofﬁces to that of the contractor.In the case of a cost plus contract however participation by the client is mandatory.Whether there is client participation or not the ﬂow sheet conference follows somebasic guidelines, and these are described in the following paragraphs:
rPreparing for the conference. The contractor’ s lead process engineer is responsiblefor organizing and conducting the ﬂow sheet conference. The ﬂow sheet that willbe used in the conference will be ‘ clean’and free from any pencil or other markson the diagram itself. It will be given the revision number ‘ 0’ , and clearly marked.‘ FLOW SHEET CONFERENCE MASTER’ .
The diagram will be complete with all lines sized and speciﬁed. Instrumentation willbe correctly shown with control valves sized, relief valves will also be shown but notnecessarily sized at this time. All equipment will be properly titled and labeled inaccordance with the agreed format for ﬂow sheet production.
Accompanying the ‘ FLOW SHEET CONFERENCE MASTER’will be the current"
"revision of the process ﬂow diagram. This will also be ‘ clean’with no pencil marksother than the label “ Flow sheet Conference Copy” . The lead process engineer willalso ensure that copies of all the equipment data sheets pertaining to the equipmentshown on the ﬂow sheet are available at the conference. The current equipment listwill also be made available at the conference. Finally, the lead process engineer or theprocess engineer he has assigned to the particular process that is to be conferencedshould have available a copy of the process calculations developed. This often helpsto resolve minor issues that may arise.
rAttendees. After notice of the conference has been issued by the lead engineer, theproject manager or his assignee will designate the location where the conference is tobe held. He will also issue directives to attendees giving the date, time, and locationof the conference. In cases of major conferences where client representatives arepresent professional secretaries may be employed to take notes at the meeting.Otherwise project engineers will be assigned this task. The notes taken at thismeeting are most important to the ﬁnal approval mechanism. The attendees areusually:
➢Client’ s representatives (if applicable)
➢Project manager (usually part time)
➢Lead process engineer (convener)ECONOMICS 817
➢Responsible process engineer(s)
➢Engineering manager
➢Area project engineer(s)
➢Lead discipline engineers (except civil & structural— called for as required)
➢Design coordinator
➢Design section heads (piping, instruments, electrical)
➢Others as required, such as environmental engineer, cost & schedule control
engineers etc.
rConducting the conference. The process engineer conducting the conference com-
mences with a brief outline of the process and its objective. He proceeds to describethe process using the process ﬂow sheet to illustrate the process ﬂow and the equip-ment. He then commences with the description of the mechanical ﬂow diagramwhich is attached to a wall or suitable frame from which it can be easily read by theattendees. Now most companies have a color code depicting ‘ additions to’ ,‘dele-
tions from’ , etc. Colored pencils are used therefore to cover all such points madeduring the conference by marking up the ﬂow sheet as the conference proceeds.Assume the color coding in this case is as follows:
➢Y ellow— Shows all items that have been conferenced
➢Red— All changes and additions
➢Blue— All deletions
➢Green— Numbers in green refer to note items taken during the conference
The process engineer conducting the conference starts at a suitable point on the left of
the ﬂow sheet. He selects a major line, checks and ‘ yellows out’the source label, andtraces the line using the yellow pencil to the ﬁrst equipment item. In tracing the linehe highlights the line number, size, and speciﬁcation shown on the line. The designcoordinator or piping designer checks this against his line list. It must match exactlyor it is marked as requiring further review. All valves and instrumentation along theline are similarly checked against piping lists or the instrument register.
The equipment item into which the line is connected is checked for correct labeling and
data. These shown on the ﬂow sheet are compared with equipment list, data sheets, andthe process ﬂow diagram for an exact match. The process engineer continues with asecond line in a similar manner. He may elect to go back to the left side of the ﬂow sheetto select this line or take a line leaving the equipment item. However, the same exerciseis carried out for all lines and equipment until the ﬂow diagram is completely yellowedout with the discussed notes marked, and with all deletion and changes shown.
This ﬂow sheet conference is a necessary activity but is nevertheless a high consumer
of man hours. The process engineer should therefore use his experience and knowl-edge to minimize the time taken in this activity. For example: where there is someconsiderable contention or where there is an area of concern to the client highlightedin the conference, the process engineer should attempt to defer a solution until afterthe conference. Appropriate note should be made however of the problem and the818 CHAPTER 17
item clearly marked with a “ HOLD” sign. Clients will normally approve ﬂow sheets
with some “ HOLDS” providing there are not too many. In further development of theﬂow diagram, priority is given to resolving the issue(s) and removal of the “ HOLD” .
Immediately after the conference the lead process engineer and the project manager
formally solicits the client’ s approval and the release of the project to detail designwork. The approved ﬂow sheet is marked as Rev 1. “ Approved for Construction” .
Approval of equipment selection"
"On a cost plus contract the client’ s project manager must approve the selection ofall pieces of equipment that will be purchased and installed. Next to the approval ofthe mechanical ﬂow sheet the commitment to purchase equipment is certainly thenext most important. Certiﬁed equipment vendor data are essential for updating thebudget and schedule. It is also important in obtaining correct outline drawings forcertain items to initiate piping lay out and also plot plan development. This certiﬁedand guaranteed data will only be made available to the project after the issue of thepurchase order.
In addition to releasing the project to essential design work in piping, civil (founda-
tions), and electrical engineering, it also enables the contractor’ s process engineers tobuild an accurate utility balance. This in turn initiates the engineering of the utilityfacilities if this is part of the project.
The contractor’ s process engineers initiate this function by developing data sheets that
deﬁne each equipment item. The data in these sheets deﬁne the equipment size and per-formance required to meet the facilities heat and material balances. On completion oftheses data sheets the contractor’ s procurement department complete the commercialconditions associated with the purchase, and send these documents to a small numberof vendors for each type of equipment soliciting their quotes for supplying the items.
The receipt of the quotations initiates the selection process. Usually the contractor’ s
procurement department develops a bid summary list of the quotes from each vendorfor a speciﬁc equipment item. The enter all the associated price and delivery, and to-gether with the actual quotations, this bid summary is then sent to the process and otherengineering disciplines who analyze the technical content of the quotes giving theircomments on the bid summary. The summary is then reviewed by the cost/schedulingengineers who compare the offers against the control budget and the master schedule.They add their comments and route the summary to the contractor’ s project managerfor recommended selection. Finally, the client’ s project manger receives the packageand the recommended selection. He usually solicits input from his project team beforeapproving the selection.
If the approval mechanism meets with some problems the client’ s project team through
the project manager may request a conference of members of the contractor’ s teamECONOMICS 819
to resolve the problem. This is sometimes requested anyway. After all the equipment
cost is a signiﬁcant portion of the total budget, and more than that an incorrect orpoor selection could well adversely affect the detail design work depending on it, andeven, much later, the construction effort (late deliveries to the ﬁeld etc.).
Purchase orders
With the selection of the equipment vendors, the contractor’ s procurement developsthe purchase orders for the client’ s approval (for cost plus or omnibus fee contracts).Prior to this activity usually the successful vendor is invited to the contractor’ s ofﬁcesfor a pre-award meeting to discuss his offer in detail. The contractor’ s purchasingdepartment prepares the purchase order for the approval signature of the contractor’ sproject manager, and, when appropriate the client’ s project manager.
Plot plan development and approval
Shortly after the commitment of the major equipment purchase orders, certiﬁed vendordata in the form of outline drawings, completed data sheets, and the like will begin tobe received by the contractor. These data are received by the purchasing departmentwhose duty is then to route the data to all the engineering and design departmentsfor checking and data acquisition. The receipt of equipment dimensioned outlinedrawings enable the design department to initiate the plot layout, showing the exactlocation of the items relative to one another. This is a combined operation involvingmost of the engineering and design disciplines. The key members of this group will bethe process engineer and the lead piping designer. Most contractors will conduct thisactivity using small scale wooden models of the items on a scaled board representingthe total site. Computerised piping isometrics and 3D visualizations can be of greathelp at this stage.
When satisﬁed with a reasonable layout, the contractor’ s project manager will arrange
a conference with all interested parties including the client’ s project team, to viewthe layout. Comments made at this review will be incorporated and the layout willbe the basis the plot plan drawing. This plot plan will then become the basic tool forrouting pipe ways, electrical and underground piping, and the civil foundation andstructural design.
On cost plus and ﬁxed fee contracts the plot plan requires client approval before use
is made of it for further design work.
Routine progress metings and conferences"
"Although there is a continual interface between the two project managers during thisphase, there need to be formal meetings between the two teams. This is usually on aset weekly basis where key members of both teams sit down together and solve theproblems that have arisen or are anticipated to occur in the near future. These routinemeetings are minuted and become part of the project record, although they may beconducted in an informal manner.820 CHAPTER 17
A more formal meeting takes place once per month. Again the participants are the two
project managers and their key staff members. Very often senior executives of bothcompanies may attend, particularly if there is a question affecting either companypolicy. This monthly meeting is convened primarily to discuss and review progressand expenditures. Obviously these topics more often than not involve some technicalinterface. Minutes of this meeting form the basis of the contractor’ s project manager’ smonthly written progress report. The distribution of this report includes the client’ sproject manager, and members of his home ofﬁce senior management, and the con-tractor’ s home ofﬁce senior management.
The master construction plan
At some point toward the end of the engineering phase and when all equipmentis deﬁned, and the bulk of material quantities are known, the master plan for theconstruction is developed. As in the case of the project master plan this item isdetailed both in terms of time and in terms of cash ﬂow. In all contracts where theﬁeld cost is reimbursable, the client’ s project team, including a representative of theirﬁeld specialist, must be involved. In all projects ﬁeld cost (and, of necessity, schedule)are signiﬁcant items in the overall project cost. Indeed in many parts of the world whereclimatic conditions or accessibility to site is a problem ﬁeld cost are the major itemin the overall project cost.
Among the ﬁrst items in the plan that has to be decided is: What method of construction
is to be adopted? Some of these options are:
rSubcontracts
rDirect hire
rField erected
rRemote modularization
There can be a mixture of these options in the overall plan for the construction, butthe decision has to be made in plenty of time for a smooth ﬁeld move in.
Monitoring the construction phaseWith the development of an approved construction plan the client’ s project team in the
contractor’ s home ofﬁce can be substantially reduced. Most of the engineering workshould be close to completion at this stage. There will still be some design work, suchas detail pipe spooling, electrical, and instrument hook-up details, to be completed.These do not require the monitoring and input from the client’ s team however. Theonly two major engineering items at this stage that will require some client input andapproval will be:
rThe operating instruction manual
rThe mechanical catalogue compilation
rPlant guaranteesECONOMICS 821
These items continue to be developed through most of the construction phase by
a small contractor’ s team consisting of one or two process engineers, a mechanicalengineer, and/or a project engineer. These will be discussed later.
The ﬁeld move in
The extent of the ﬁeld ‘ move in’will depend on the type of construction decidedon, the location of the site, and the proximity of the labor source to site. The mostextensive effort in this respect is the situation where it is decided to utilize direct laborand this labor source is a considerable distance from site. In this case the contractormust set up a camp for the labor and ﬁeld staff complete with canteen, social facilitiesand the like. Developing labor contracts also becomes a major activity for both thecontractor and the client in approving these contracts. In this situation there would bea deﬁnite advantage in totally subcontracting the work. This ﬁeld aspect of the ‘ movein’would become part of the subcontract.
Monitoring the ﬁeld activities
The activities of the client’ s project team during the construction phase is reduced tomonitoring the cost and schedule with respect to the master construction plan. Theteam itself will probably be reduced to the project manager and possibly a projectengineer with the process engineer on a part time basis. It is also likely that this smallerproject team will remain in the contractor’ s ofﬁce rather than move permanently tosite. Usually monthly site meetings are conducted and the project manager amongothers would attend these meetings. During such meetings physical review of progressin the ﬁeld would accompany an in depth written and verbal report on the scheduleand the cost aspect.
Although the project manager would not be present full time on site, there would be"
"a client presence there continually. Heading this team would be the client’ s construc-tion specialist, with some project engineering assistance. As the construction workprogresses this team would expand to include specialists in all disciplines who willfollow the installation and testing of equipment relating to these various disciplines.These would include mechanical engineers, electrical, and instrument engineers. Thefollow-up for the piping installation would usually be undertaken by piping specialists(to check such details as piping layout conforming to plan, pipe stress analysis and thelike). Most clients also include the proposed permanent operators and maintenancestaff of the facility in this team.
Final activities of the project team-mechanical completion
The erection of the facilities is considered complete when all the equipment, piping,cables, buildings (if any) have been installed, and such testing that is necessary (such asline and vessel pressure testing) has been done. The contractor is also responsible forcompleting all insulation, such refractory lining as may be required, and the disposalof debris from the site. Most vessels may be left open for ﬁnal inspection by the client.822 CHAPTER 17
When satisﬁed that all activities required to be done by him according to contract
have been completed, the contractor will issue a formal notice to the client that thefacilities are ‘ Mechanically Complete’ . With the receipt of such a notice the clientusually has a ﬁxed period according to contract to check the plant out and to informthe contractor of any defects or omissions to the plant. The contractor will remedythese items notiﬁed by the client and then issue a formal notice handing over the plantto the client in terms of ‘ Transfer of Custody and Control’ . On acceptance of thisnotice the client takes over the facilities and prepares to commission them.
Developing the operating manual and plant commissioning
The development of the operating manual occurs toward the end of the engineering
and design phase in the contractors home ofﬁce. Although normally compiled by thecontractor’ s process engineers the client’ s operating staff invariably participate.
Very often too the process engineers who have been most closely associated with par-ticular process plant(s) on the project may be required to assist in the commissioningof those plants. This section of Chapter 17 describes the activities associated withboth these functions.
Developing the operating manual
The operating manual is a compilation of instructions and data reﬂecting recom-
mended procedures for:
rPrestart-up conditioning of the plant
rPlant start-up
rNormal operation, and trouble shooting
rEmergency action and shut down
rNormal shut down
rCatalyst regeneration and de-coking (where applicable)
These procedures include equipment manufacturers’recommended handling, condi-tioning, and operation of their items of equipment and the experience of the processengineer who designed the plant. To the process engineer the writing of the operatingmanual provides him with the ﬁnal ‘ In Depth’ review of the mechanical ﬂow diagramof the plant. During the course of writing the manual he will use the MFD continuallyto make reference to the operating procedures he proposes. Anomalies or missingvalves and piping become obvious as the process engineer develops the procedurelogic.
A typical operating manual has the following table of contents:ECONOMICS 823

This will include a brief statement as to the contents of the manual and its purpose.This will be followed by a process description which will include the “ Approved forConstruction” revision of the process ﬂow diagram as reference.
Prestart-up conditioning
This item describes the cleaning out of the plant after construction and its reassemblyfollowing the clean out. For example this item will designate those lines and equipmentthat will be ﬂushed out by water and those that will be blown out by air. It will alsodescribe the equipment and materials that will be used for this clean out such as pipingspool pieces to replace control valves and nozzles and lines that will be blankedoff during this activity. Finally, this item will draw attention to the manufacturer’ sprocedures for the various equipment clean out and conditioning. Copies of the actualmanufacturer’ s documents relating to this activity should be included in the appendicesof the manual. It is important in order to maintain the warranties that accompany mostequipment that the manufacturer’ s instructions be carefully adhered to.
Plant start-up"
"This section of the manual presupposes that the plant has been properly cleaned, allutilities to the plant have been commissioned, all equipment is ready for operation, alldrains are free, and ﬁre ﬁghting equipment and procedures are in place. The processengineer then begins his detailed description of the activities to be carried out intheir proper sequence to bring the plant on line and producing the products intended.To accomplish this he refers to the MFD. Using this document he describes eachaction in the start-up sequence by referring to line numbers, control valve numbers,equipment item numbers and titles as they appear on the diagram. Normally all theseactions start with introducing the cold feed. For example in the case of the ThermalCracker project, cold feed from storage would be used for start-up. Sufﬁcient lines andvalves would be provided for this purpose and the manual text would be somewhat asfollows:
“ Open block valves at tank TK 101 and at the plant battery limits on line 1234 CS
12
/prime/primeST. Open the suction valves on pump P 106 A and start the pump (Note: Only
the term “ Start the pump”need be made as instructions on how to start the pumpare included in the manufacturer’ s documents found in the appendices.). Set the ﬂowcontrol valves 106 FRCV 1 A, B, and C to full open. Set back pressure controller300 PRCV 1 at the outlet of heater H 301 to 250 psig.

Normal Operation
This section carries on from the end of ‘ start up’with the unit lined out and in stableoperation. It then describes a series of procedures during normal operation to ﬁne tunecertain parameters, and to maintain the plant on set conditions when minor changesin feed composition, temperature changes, etc. occur. It must be noted here that inmodern control systems associated with plant operation these type of adjustments aremade automatically with very little need for operator intervention.
The other adjustments that may still require operator action are those associated with
changing the product grade or speciﬁcation. This section therefore still includes aselected list of operating changes that may be required to be made under normaloperating conditions and the procedures used to make these changes.
Normal shutdown procedures
Normal shutdown procedures are usually divided into two forms, which are:
rShort duration shutdown
rShutdown for an extended period
This ﬁrst type of shutdown is that associated with a minor mechanical problem, or tem-porary loss of feed, or a minor instrumentation problem and the like. In these cases thefeed to the plant is diverted but some or all of the product streams are rerouted back totake the place of the normal feed. The feed heater, if it is a ﬁred heater, may continueto be ﬁred on a lower level of operation but sufﬁcient to enable a quick resumptionto normal operation when the fault causing the shutdown has been rectiﬁed. The unitunder these conditions is said to be “ Boxed In” .
The second type of normal shut is the more common and occurs when a major fault
has occurred requiring equipment to be taken out of service for repair. This type ofshutdown is also placed on a predeﬁned schedule for routine maintenance. Such ashutdown requires the unit feed to be withdrawn and the unit itself allowed to cooldown to ambient temperature, de-pressured, cleaned out usually by steam, and drainedfree of any hazardous material.
This section of the manual describes both these procedures in the same detail as
described earlier for ‘ Normal Start up’ . Again the MFD is used as a reference in thesedetail procedures.
Emergency procedures
This section is the most important in the manual, and requires careful developmentand presentation. Its importance is reﬂected in the fact that very often the preparationof this section becomes a combined effort of both the client process engineers and thecontractor’ s process engineer. Its obvious importance to the safety of all personnelECONOMICS 825
working on the plant is often coupled with the requirements of insurance underwriters
and, in the case of a major mishap, its legal signiﬁcance.
The section should contain at least the following sub sections:
rEmergency shutdown
rEmergency action by personnel
rPlan showing location of ﬁre ﬁghting equipment
rEmergency telephone numbers (by client)
rLocation and setting of pressure relief valves
The contractor’ s process engineer is primarily concerned with the writing of the
emergency shutdown procedures. In most process unit this follows the same basicprinciples, which are:
1.0 If there is a ﬁred heater either as a feed pre-heater or reboiler, shut down the"
"burners immediately and introduce steam into the ﬁrebox.
2.0 Again, in the case of ﬁred heaters, take out the fresh feed and recycle products
through the coil until the coil is cool enough not to be damaged. Use vendor data
to ﬁx this temperature.
3.0 Cool down fractionating towers by increasing reﬂux ﬂow and wherever possible
reducing return temperatures.
4.0 In the case of reactors, remove the feed stream immediately and purge with inert
gas such as nitrogen. In the case of reactors in exothermal service and where thereis a coolant, increase the coolant duty.
5.0 Divert all product streams to slop, but maintain any cooling cycle until safe
conditions are reached.
6.0 De-pressure all pressure vessels to ﬂare or to atmosphere at a safe location. Note:
The process engineer must make sure that there exists a de-pressuring system onall these vessels and that they are clearly shown on the MFD.
7.0 As soon as conditions allow, introduce purge steam into all vessels, towers, and,
where applicable, reactors. In some cases steam would be injurious to catalysts inreactors, under these circumstances the reactors should be purged with inert gas.
8.0 If the emergency is the result of a ﬁre in a heater ﬁrebox due to a fractured coil,
shutdown the burners and take out the feed immediately. Introduce snufﬁngsteam into the ﬁrebox, and do not recycle product or introduce steam into thefractured coil.
As in the case of start-up and normal shutdown procedures the same kind of detailcovering the basic actions given above would be written for the emergency shutdown.Again the MFD would be used as the reference document.
Appendices
The appendices to the manual should contain as much data as possible to assist theoperator of the plant in the safe operation of the plant. As a minimum it should contain:826 CHAPTER 17
rThe “ As Built Revision” of the MFD
rAn up to date equipment list
rEquipment manufacturers operating instructions and data
rA list of hazardous materials used in the process, with a summary of recommended
handling procedures
Plant commissioning
Process engineers from the contractor’ s organization are often called upon to assist
in supervising plant commissioning. Process engineers from the client’ s organizationare invariably called to supervise the commissioning. This task begins at the pointwhere the contractor’ s ﬁeld organization has completed all their installation activitiesand have handed the units over to the client’ s“care, custody and control” . At this
point all contractor’ s debris has been removed, pressure testing has been completed,and the unit has been reassembled after the initial ﬂushing out.
The commissioning activities fall into the following sequence of events:
rPre energizing activities
rEnergizing the plant
rConditioning equipment, calibrating instruments, and setting relief valves
rFinal check out, and closing up all vessels
rPreparation for “ start up”
rStart-up
rLining out
rPerformance test runs and guarantee test run
Much of this work is carried out by the future operators of the plant to enhance their
familiarity with the process, and as mentioned earlier, the team is supervised and theactivities planned by the responsible process engineer(s). Further description of themajor commissioning activities now follow:
Pre-energizing activities
When the plant is handed over by the contractor to the client no hazardous materialsuch as fuel oil, fuel gas or permanent electrical power has been introduced into theplant area. Obviously before much of the work to check out and condition equipmentutility services must be established, and this will be the objective of this phase of thework. Normally while the plant is in this “ safe” condition many client companies takeadvantage of this to carry out their ﬁnal physical check of the plant on a line by line,item by item basis.
Although the contractor has ﬂushed the plant out before hand over a further and more
thorough ﬂush out is advisable before start-up. This is done at this “ safe plant” stagewhen utility lines and underground lines can also be ﬂushed out. If the plant is a unit inECONOMICS 827
an existing complex oily or chemical drains would at this point be blocked off from the
complex’ s main drain systems. Immediately prior to the plant being energized thesedrain systems must be unplugged and checked that they are free of any obstruction.
Energizing the plant
As soon as the responsible process engineer is satisﬁed that all pre energizing activitiesare complete he will instruct that the utility systems be commissioned. Normally thisstarts with the introduction of permanent power and the checking out of the circuits bythe electrical technicians. When this has been completed to the responsible processengineer’ s satisfaction, instructions for commissioning the steam, condensate, andfuel systems will follow. Note: the water system is usually commissioned before theﬁnal ﬂush out and the system used for this ﬂushing activity."
"The commissioning of the fuel systems indicates that the plant is now a ‘ Hazardous
Area’and all regulations pertaining to this type of area comes into effect.
Conditioning equipment
Certain new process equipment will require conditioning before being used in theprocess. Some of these are:
Reactors: In some processes these will have refractory lining which will need to be
‘ Cured’ . Curing is the subjection of the refractory to a controlled increasing tem-perature environment until the curing temperature is reached. The refractory is heldat this temperature for a prescribed period of time, before cooling back to ambienttemperature. The cooling is also undertaken in a controlled fashion. Many reactorsand reactor systems also require drying out. This too is accomplished during thisperiod using heated air or inert gas and the recycle gas compressor if there is one inthe circuit.
Heaters: All heaters will have refractory lining and these will need to be ‘ Cured’as
described above. If the heater contains coils that are to be used in steam generationservice, these coils need to be treated with hot caustic soda to remove all traces ofgrease or other undesirable contaminants.
Fractionating columns and vessels generally: These usually need to be dried. This is
usually done at the same time that the associated heaters are being conditioned. Thehot air or inert gas stream passing through the heater coils to protect them during therefractory curing is routed to the vessels and used for the drying activity.
Piping in sour service: Piping and pots etc in high H
2S and hydrogen concentration
service often need to be acid treated to protect them against local corrosion or embat-
tlement under these conditions. This is called ‘ Pickling’and is usually accomplishedby setting up a temporary system. This contains a reservoir for the fresh acid, one or two828 CHAPTER 17
small skid mounted reciprocating pumps and a receptacle for the used acid. The pumps
deliver the acid through the piping and equipment for a prescribed period of time.
All of these conditioning procedures are provided by the respective equipment man-
ufacturers and would be included as part of the operating manual.
The opportunity is normally taken at this time to calibrate as much instrumentation
as possible. Flow meter oriﬁce plates are installed and, where possible, ﬂow metersand control valves used in these procedures. Relief valves are set, and this is alwaysdone by the client’ s organization, and the settings certiﬁed.
Final check out, and closing up of all vessels
This will be the last opportunity to check such items as the internals of towers, frac-tionation trays, condition of refractory and other linings, hold up grids, distributors,and the bottom of the tower bafﬂing system (to and from the re-boiler). A ﬁnal check-out of the piping layout also needs to be carried out at this point. When satisﬁed thatall is satisfactory the process engineer will authorize the following ﬁnal prestart-upactivities to be completed:
rCatalyst loaded into the respective reactors. This is often supervised by the licensor’ srepresentative. The reactor closed up by installing the correct operating gaskets.This later point is made because during the prestart-up activities and conditioningtemporary gaskets are used on manways, nozzle connections and the like. Theseare replaced by the correctly speciﬁed gaskets for the operating conditions. Thetemporary gaskets are never used again and are thrown away.
rAll towers containing random packing are loaded with the packing and closed up.Permanent speciﬁed gaskets are used to replace temporary gaskets as describedabove.
rAll other vessels and towers are closed up using the permanent speciﬁed gaskets.
rIn cases where equipment has been subject to a caustic wash the temporary silicalevel gauges used during the wash are replaced by the speciﬁed operational ones.
With the completion of these ﬁnal checks and vessel close up, the plant is now readyfor start-up.
Start-up and lining out
The activities and their sequence for starting up the plant are carried out as describedin the operating manual. In the case of an oil reﬁning plant for example the ﬁrst activityis to eliminate air from the plant systems. This is done by using water or steam orinert gas or a combination of all three. The use of steam or water is prohibited formost reactor system where the catalyst would be irreparably damaged by such contact.Thus inert gas is circulated using the recycle compressor for this purging. Thus therecycle compressor is commissioned and will then continue to function until plantshut down. In the case of the fractionating units of the crude distillation and thermalECONOMICS 829
cracking systems, water and steam are used for purging. The water is used to purge
the heaters and tower bottom systems and steam is used for purging the upper sectionsof the fractionating towers."
"After the purging comes the introduction of the cold feeds. In the case of units that
contain reactors and use hydrogen under pressure a leak testing program is required.First of all the plant is subject to leak testing at operating pressure using the inert gas.Then as the inert gas is replaced by hydrogen further leak tests are required. All leaksmust be repaired before start-up of these units can begin.
Where water has been used for purging, the water is replaced by the oil feed. This is
termed the ‘ oil squeeze’ . The steam is not replaced by anything. It continues to ﬂowthrough the tower until after start-up where it may then be replaced by the vapor phaseof fractionation.
Start-up may be deﬁned as beginning when the purge program shows conditions to be
safe to apply heat into the plant. In the case of catalytic plants using a hydrogen stream,the hydrogen stream is circulated and heated up to its operating temperature ﬁrst. Whenthe plant operating conditions are on gas circulation the oil feed is introduced andheated.
In the case of the noncatalytic units where only fractionation is being carried out heat
may by applied to the oil feed directly. This is done when the oil squeeze is completeand the water content of the oil ﬂowing out of the plant is at an acceptable level. Theplant conditions are obtained in accordance with the procedures described in the oper-ating manual by adjusting heat input, reﬂux rates, pressures and respective circulatingrates in the case of the catalytic plants. Up to the point when the operating conditionshave been reached the total products have been routed to slop. They may be returnedlater as feed or used in the reﬁnery fuel system. As soon as the plant has reached itsoperating conditions product streams are required to be diverted to storage. This isdone however only after the product quality has been conﬁrmed by laboratory tests.
Performance and guarantee test runsUsually as soon as possible after the plant has been lined out and is in production a
performance test run may be carried out. The purpose of this test run would be toestablish as far as possible the limits of the various systems included in the process.Normal feedstock would be used and the performance of the plants under variousoperating conditions examined. The other objective of this exercise is to familiarizethe operators with the plant control responses to the various changes.
The guarantee test run is a more formal requirement. At the end of the test run carried
out over a ﬁxed period and under speciﬁc conditions, the client will accept the plant830 CHAPTER 17
completely or require remedial work and further test runs to meet the guarantees.
More details on this test run is given in the next section of this chapter.
An example of a commissioning plan used in the commissioning of a ‘ grass roots’ re-
ﬁnery on sites facilities is given in Figure 17.1.12. This plan reﬂects the program for theonsite units and tank farm only. All the utility plants had already been commissionedand started up before this plan begins. The program was successful and apart fromsome minor problems the reﬁnery was brought on stream in the time span predicted.
Process guarantees and the guarantee test run
Among the last activities that a contractor’ s process engineer performs on a project is
the preparation of the process guarantees that are usually required by the client, andthe procedure for testing the plant to meet the guarantees. The process guaranteesmay begin to be developed as soon as a ﬁrm process has been established and manu-facturer’ s guarantees obtained for the performance of the various manufactured itemsof equipment. The process engineer may be required to guarantee the performanceof any plant that he has calculated and speciﬁed equipment, piping, instruments etcfor. He will not be expected to guarantee the performance of any item of plant orpiece of equipment he has not speciﬁcally designed. He will also not be expected toguarantee any criteria that cannot be measured during a test run. Thus if a processengineer calculates a fractionating unit to meet a speciﬁed separation, he will be ex-pected to guarantee that the design will make the separation at the design feed rate andcomposition. He will not however be expected to guarantee the performance of in-dividual items of equipment contained in the unit, and which have been properlyspeciﬁed by him. This guarantee is carried by the respective manufacturers who havedesigned and fabricated the items.
The process performance is tied also to a guarantee of its efﬁciency. This will be in
terms of a guarantee of the utility consumption in the plant whilst operating on thedesign throughput and conditions. Of course the guarantees as written will differfrom process to process but will usually follow a similar pattern or format. This is asfollows:
rDescription of the feed in terms of throughput, composition, or source (in the caseof crude oil for example)."
"rDesign operating conditions and the guarantee of the product speciﬁcation at theseconditions. Alternatively a guarantee of the fractionation or separation performanceof the process in terms of key component separation.
rA guarantee of the hydraulic capacity of the process system. This would only bein the terms that the process system will handle a design quantity per unit time.Note, this hydraulic guarantee would not normally be combined with the streamcomposition speciﬁcation guarantee. This is discussed later.ECONOMICS 831
Figure 17.1.12. A typical commissioning plan.832 CHAPTER 17
rThe utility consumption guarantees. These are usually taken for the total plants in
the new or revamped complex. Rarely are utility guarantees written for individualunits making up the new or revamped complex.
rA list of the accepted test procedures that will be used.
rThe guarantee test run procedures that are written in some detail. Provision isnormally made in them for the contractor’ s process engineer to instruct operatingchanges to be made as necessary before or during the test run.
rDescription of the notices to be given in event that:
1. The test run was successful and met all the requirements of the guarantee.
or
2. The test run was not successful and requires to be run again.
or
3. Some or all of the guarantee requirements cannot be met and a limited liability
clause is evoked.
The following paragraphs describe and discusses the contents of a performance guar-antee in more detail than given in the list above.
Description of the design feedstock
Although the plant may have been designed on the basis of handling more than one
feedstock of slightly differing composition, the test run is conducted using one of thedesign feedstocks as a parameter. This practice is more common in the oil reﬁningindustry than in the production of chemicals or even petrochemicals. This is so becausemost reﬁneries handle crude oil from various sources around the world, and these canvary considerably in composition. The intermediate products from the various crudeoils therefore can also vary in composition.
The choice and proper deﬁnition of the test run feedstock is absolutely basic in
developing the guarantees and assessing the result of the guarantee test run(s). Thisbegins by providing a statement of the design feed throughput. This should be assimple as possible and preferably in the units of measurement used in the client’ soriginal “ Duty Speciﬁcation” . If the measurement units used in the design or the
units of measurement used in the operation of the process differs from that in the“ Duty Speciﬁcation” , then the conversion factors used to convert from one unit ofmeasurement to the others must be noted here. There must be no ambiguity concerningthis quantity.
The second item of importance in this section is the composition of the design feed-
stock. Where possible this should be a breakdown in the quantity of each componentin either weight or molar terms. Occasionally volume composition may be used, how-ever, the composition and the units it is quoted must be able to be measured using
accepted normal test equipment and/or reagents.ECONOMICS 833
When it is not possible to give the feed composition as described above other accept-
able criteria for establishing the feed quality may be used. For example in deﬁning thequality or composition of a crude oil or the products of crude oil distillation boilingpoints and boiling curves are used (See “Elements of Petroleum Processing” also by
the author
1). Again however these characteristics of the feedstock must be measurable
by accepted means. The test methods to be used in evaluating the guarantee test runresults are listed in this document. This item is discussed later.
Test run conditions and the guarantee of product quality
Following the description covering the design feedstock comes the heart of the perfor-
mance guarantee— the guarantee of the end product. This guarantee however is alwaystied to the feedstock and to the conditions that the plant is operated on to meet theproduct speciﬁcation. Where there is a catalytic or any other type of reactor involvedin the process this guarantee may extend to cover the yield of product promised bythe contractor or the licensor.
The pertinent process conditions to obtain the guarantee with respect to the end
product is deﬁned here. Obviously these conditions will reﬂect the basic parametersused in the design of the facility. The process engineer developing the guaranteedocument however must be sure that the conditions described here are pertinent to
meeting the end product speciﬁcations and yield. Over or incomplete deﬁnition of theprocess conditions may lead to ambiguity and conﬂict in operating the plant undertest run conditions.
The product speciﬁcation, and its yield under certain circumstances should reﬂect
exactly those given in the client’ s“Duty Speciﬁcation” . Yields and or product quality"
"which have been left open or to be conﬁrmed by a licensor’ s pilot plant tests, duringthe compiling of the “ Duty Speciﬁcation”must be included here. These should bequaliﬁed however with reference to the client’ s acceptance of them and his approvalfor their use in the plant design. They become part of the client’ s licensor agreement.The contractor may then develop the remaining process guarantees on the designcarried out by him based on this approved licensor data.
Performance of the plant may also be judged by the performance of some engineering
principle used in the design. For example in oil reﬁning the performance of some ofthe complex fractionators used (e.g., the atmospheric crude distillation unit) is mostoften deﬁned in terms of fractionating efﬁciency. This is measured by the differencein the ASTM distillation temperature reading between a 95 vol% recovery of a lightproduct and the 5 vol% reading of the adjacent heavier product. The test used todetermine these readings is the accepted ASTM distillation test carried out routinely
1Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.834 CHAPTER 17
in all reﬁneries. The measure of these test temperatures indicates how much of the
lighter product is contained in the heavier one and vice versa. This of course is also ameasure of the respective products composition and the contaminants they contain.
The hydraulic guaranteeAlthough this is tied to the plant design and its ability to handle the feed and product
streams as stated earlier it is guaranteed separately to the performance guaranteedescribed above. This is so because very often it is not possible for a contractorto guarantee the quantity of product that the plant will make. An example of thisis again seen in the oil industry. When a contractor’ s process engineer designs theunlicensed units of an oil reﬁnery he does so using the design crude’ s assay data. Allthe product yields and composition therefore are based on the assay data which thecontractor could not have developed— he is therefore not expected to guarantee it.From his design calculation however he has sized the various systems in terms ofpiping instruments and of course speciﬁed the various pumps. He is expected toguarantee these based on the design ﬂows he has used. Thus, the hydraulic guaranteeshould start with the following statement:
“ When the unit is operated on the design feedstock and at the design feed rate the
following systems shall be capable of handling:
rStream One 450 gpm measured at 60
◦F
rStream Two 600 gpm measured at 60◦F
Utility consumption guarantees
Normally contractors offer utility guarantees as a summation of the cost of all utilities
consumed by the process. These are also determined as a summary of the utilitiesconsumed by all the plants considered in the test run. The utility guarantee ﬁgure isdeveloped from the utility balances compiled during the process design. Much of theseﬁgures are based on manufacturers guaranteed equipment efﬁciencies for electricmotors and turbines. Others are based on the process heat and material balances Thecalculated utility consumption for each utility is multiplied by the respective utilityunit cost as provided by the client in his “ Duty Speciﬁcation” . The utility guaranteeﬁgure is then quoted as the sum of all these cost items as a single cost ﬁgure.
In preparing the utility guarantee the following should appear in the statement of the
guarantee:
rUnit cost of each utility
rExpected normal consumption of each utility
rEither the guaranteed total daily cost of all the utilities as one ﬁgure (This would
include a contingency factor agreed to by the client.)ECONOMICS 835
Or
rA guaranteed daily cost of all the utilities as a percentage of the expected normal
consumption
The description of the remaining items that make up the guarantee document are selfexplanatory and are illustrated in the example of a typical process guarantee givenin Appendix 17.1.9. This example is based on the study case for the thermal crackerillustrated in the various sections of this Chapter.
In this example it is assumed that the contract has been awarded on a lump sum basis
for engineering, all other home ofﬁce functions and the contractor’ s proﬁt fee. Theother costs such as equipment, materials and the installation of the plant is on a costpayable directly by the client basis.836 CHAPTER 17

overhead naphtha drum. The naphtha product shall have an ASTM distillation
end point of not more than 387◦F.
3.0 The gas oil side stream product shall have an ASTM 90 vol% distilled at a
temperature no higher than 645◦F.
4.0 The fuel oil as residue from the cracker primary tower shall have a minimum
Pensky Martin ﬂash point of 200◦F and shall be thermally stable.
Process conditions
1.0. Thermal cracker furnaceIt is required that the furnace and transfer line be capable of effecting a crack of 25
wt% on feed of gas and naphtha to a TBP cut point of 340
◦F . The transfer line outlet
temperature from the furnace shall not be higher than 920◦F at a pressure of 250 psig.
The injection of HP steam into the furnace coils may be considered to increaseturbulence and minimize the lay-down of coke. Should steam be used it’ s volume underthe furnace conditions must be accounted for in the design of the furnace coil(s).Thetemperature of the feed to the inlet of the furnace soaking section must be control-lable.
2.0. The main fractionatorThe feed to the fractionator from the furnace must be quenched to a suitable tempera-
ture to meet the residue cut point requirement. This temperature must also be sufﬁcientto produce enough over ﬂash for proper fractionation between the distillate streams.
The column will be operated at a pressure in the overhead distillate drum of 50 psig.
Naphtha distillate stream shall be maximized and steam stripping of the gas oil sidestream should be considered in this respect. Fractionation criteria in terms of gaps(and overlaps) between the distillate streams shall be:844 CHAPTER 17
ASTM Dist 95% temp of naphtha and 5% temp of gas oil to be not less than +15◦F.
The residue leaving the bottom of the tower shall be steam stripped for ﬂash point
control. It shall also be quenched in the well of the tower to prevent further cracking.A cold residue stream is recommended for this quench.

"5.0.Qualiﬁcations for guarantees
5.1.Notwithstanding any other sections or statements in this exhibit, the guarantees
in Sections 2.0 to 4.0 inclusive, above are subject to change if Licensor information,
data, or designs for the licensed units should be revised at any time so as to differ fromthe Licensor’ s information, data, or designs in the Contractor’ s possession on –Date–,or if licensed units require more utilities than speciﬁed by the aforesaid Licensorinformation, data or designs.
5.2.In no event shall the contractor be liable for contingent or consequential damages,
including damages for loss of products or proﬁt or for plant downtime.6.0.Performance test procedures.
To determine whether the guarantees deﬁned in Sections 2.0 to 4.0 are met, the
following test run procedure will be used:
6.1.The contractor will notify the owner in writing when the plants or any portion
thereof is ready for initial operation. Within 30 days thereafter, the owner will perform
a series of test runs unless delays are caused by deﬁciencies that are the contractor’ sresponsibility. If the performance test run for the plants or any portion thereof is notconducted by the owner within 30 days after notiﬁcation by the contractor to ownerof availability for test run, it shall be conclusively presumed that the performanceguarantees have been met and that contractor’ s obligations covered herein have beensatisﬁed and owner agrees to pay any sums due to the contractor as if the test runshad been successfully met. The time of these test runs may be initiated at any hour ofday or night. Test periods shall be of 72 hr duration or less as mutually agreed uponby owner and contractor and may be interrupted as follows:
6.1.1. For minor alterations, repairs, failure of feedstock, utility supply, or other
condition beyond the contractor’ s reasonable control, each of which do not exceed
24 hr. the test run shall proceed promptly after the interruption and as soon as thecontractor deems the plant operation has leveled out. The sum of normal operatingperiods before, between, and after such interruption shall be considered the requiredtest period when it totals 72 hr.
6.2.Owner shall be responsible for supplying all the necessary operating labor, feed
stocks, utilities, catalysts, chemicals, sampling laboratory analyses, and other supplies848 CHAPTER 17
for operating and testing the process units. Owner shall maintain the process units in
accordance with good practice, and all catalysts shall be in essentially new conditionto the end that the process units will be in proper condition for the performance testsprovided for herein.
6.3. The contractor shall furnish observers and test engineers, excluding licensor
personnel, to technically advise owner during the performance tests. Contractor’ s
observers shall have the right to issue instructions regarding the manner in which theplant is to be operated during the test run. Owner shall comply with these instructionsunless the instructions are contrary to generally accepted safety practices or exposeequipment conditions of temperature, pressure, or stress greater than their maximumallowable operating conditions.
6.4. Analyses of the streams and products for these tests shall be determined by
methods mutually agreed to by owner and contractor. Analysis will be conducted by
owner and may be observed or witnessed by contractor. In case of disagreement, areferee laboratory may be selected by approval of both parties and paid for by theowner.
6.5. Samples shall be spot and/or composite and sampling procedure shall be by
methods as mutually agreed upon by owner and contractor. Samples shall be taken
at uniform intervals. Elapsed time between samples or sample increments shall notexceed 4 hr, and composite samples increments shall be of equal volume when ﬂowrate is essentially uniform. All ﬂow rates, product rates, and analysis shall be averagedover the test period. Where possible, tanks shall be gauged at frequent intervals tosubstantiate meter readings.
6.6.The performance guarantees shall be considered satisfactorily met when the av-
erage of the performance results during the period meets or exceeds the performance
speciﬁed in Sections 2.0 to 4.0 of this exhibit. Owner shall be responsible for the se-curity of the unit operating log sheets, charts, laboratory test results, gauging records,and other pertinent information for the test period. Within 10 days after the comple-tion of each performance test, owner shall submit a written statement for each unitindicating whether the guarantee has been met. If the test is not acceptable to theowner, then the owner shall specify in writing to the contractor in what respect theperformance has not been met .On request the owner shall submit to contractor allrecords and calculations for review.
6.7.A performance test run shall be stopped when in the judgement of the contractor
alterations, adjustments, repairs, and/or replacements which cannot be made safely"
"with the equipment in operation must be made to enable the plant to meet and fulﬁllthe performance guarantees, or the data obtained during the test will not be sufﬁcientto establish the actual performance of the unit within desired limits of error, or itECONOMICS 849
becomes obvious that such performance test cannot be satisfactorily concluded in the
current attempt.

17.2 Economic analysis
P . R. Pujad´ o
Introduction
In this introductory economic analysis we cover two main subjects:
Economic analysis at one point in time
This “ instantaneous” analysis is the most common since it entails the least difﬁculty
and requires the least amount of information. This is the type of analysis seen in ChemSystems’PERP reports and in SRI’ s PEP reports. If properly done and properly used,the results derived from this analysis are excellent. In this write-up we devote most ofthe attention to this analysis; in particular, we try to analyze each of the terms in detail.Although this analysis requires the least information, in order to do a proper job theamount of information required is usually still beyond what is commonly available inthe initial screening stages of a project. However, the insight provided by examiningthe various entries is of great value as it helps to identify missing data. Also, evenwith incomplete information, this type of analysis is especially useful to determinethe sensitivity of a project relative to a number of parameters.
Economic analysis over an extended period of time
This analysis, usually known as “ cash ﬂow analysis,” is performed by analyzing the
(expected) performance of a project over an extended period of time, usually a numberof years at least equal to the capital depreciation or amortization period. The value ofthis type of analysis is that it recognizes the “ time value of money.”
A cash ﬂow analysis does not require more information than an instantaneous analysis,
but it does introduce some additional concepts in the calculation of the discounted cashﬂow rate or return or internal rate of return (IRR) and other discounting parameters.
851852 CHAPTER 17
Calculation of the IRR used to be difﬁcult when slide rules prevailed, since it entails
a trial-and-error calculation; it is quite trivial with just about any computer or even asmall programmable calculator. A cash ﬂow analysis is an absolute necessity to ac-count for the effects of taxation and inﬂation since these are usually spread out overa number of years and the effects are carried over from year-to-year, especially whendeferred taxes accrue out of the different depreciation and/or amortization methodsused for tax accounting as opposed to ﬁnancial accounting. However, in order to keepit simple, this Introductory Economic Analysis will not cover multiple depreciationschedules, tax accounting, and the like.
Indirectly, the cash ﬂow analysis can also be used to decide what the prospective sale
price of a product should be. The price can be calculated so as to yield a desireddiscounted cash ﬂow rate of return.
Accounting for inﬂationThe effects of inﬂation, though important in real life, tend to be irrelevant and mis-
leading for economic evaluations and can best be dismissed by always performing aconstant-dollar analysis."
"If inﬂation needs to be taken into account, it is easy to incorporate inﬂationary fac-
tors that adjust the numerical values on an annual basis. The formulas provided inthe appendices in general do not apply when variable annual cash ﬂows have to beaccounted for. The calculations are then performed by creating a series of estimatedannual cash ﬂows and conducting the calculations by trial-and-error. Some of thetrial-and-error calculations are already programmed in the functions usually avail-able in most PC software packages. Other calculations may require some simpleprogram coding; half interval splitting (dichotomous search) is usually suitable forconvergence.
The interpretation of the results when inﬂation is accounted for tends to be muddied
by the additive effect of inﬂation. The gross returns will increase if inﬂation leads toincreasing cash ﬂows but may decrease if inﬂationary pressures raise the costs fasterthan the revenues.
Analysis at one point in time
This section examines what can be regarded as an analysis at one given point in
time. This “ instant” analysis is normally conﬁned to a typical period in the life of theproject, usually one year. This is the usual type of economic analysis and is also thetype found in Chem Systems’reports, SRI’ s reports, etc.ECONOMIC ANAL YSIS 853
An analysis of this type normally entails three parts:
rCapital summary
rProduction cost summary
rReporting parameters
In the ﬁrst part, capital summary, we tabulate those items that may be candidates
for depreciation, amortization, or interest charges for both long-term and short-termcapital. Typical items are:
rErected plant cost
rErected offsites cost
rInterest during construction
rCatalyst and metals inventory
rWorking capital
If the economic analysis is intended to account for tax effects, a far more detailedbreakdown is required for capital items since, for tax purposes, the depreciation sched-ules may vary considerably from item to item, principally as concerns the treatmentof machinery, equipment, and offsites.
The second part, production cost summary, provides a condensed tabulation of the
various items that contribute toward the ﬁnal cost of the manufactured product. Thereare two basic ways of conducting an “ instantaneous” economic analysis as describedherein: (a) to arrive at a cost of production, or (b) to arrive at a given return-on-capital(ROI). Both formats are similar in concept and execution, the only difference beingthat the latter, b, requires the assignation of cash values to the main product or products.
The following items are normally included:
V ariable credits (often shown as credits against variable costs)
Materials
Product revenue (only shown if required to set margins)
By-product credits
Utilities

V ariable costsMaterials

Following is an itemized summary of each section.
The ﬁnal section of an economic analysis, instantaneous, or over time, may be referred
to as “ reporting parameters.” In this section the project performance is measured byusing some commonly acceptable yardsticks: return-on-investment (ROI), pay-backor pay-out time, internal rate of return (IRR), discounted cash ﬂow rate of return(DCFRR), etc. They will be discussed in more detail later.
Capital items
The ﬁrst part of an economic analysis requires an exposition of the capital items. This
includes those items that can be either depreciated, amortized, or that enter indirectlyin the cost of production through either a long-term or a short-term interest charge.Typical entries are:
rErected plant cost
rErected offsites costECONOMIC ANAL YSIS 855
rInterest during construction
rRoyalties
rCatalyst and metals inventory
rWorking capital
Erected plant cost
By erected plant cost we mean the estimated cost of construction inclusive of materials,
equipment and labor, plus design, engineering, and contractor’ s fees within batterylimits as usually provided by cost estimating [Estimated Erected Cost or EEC]. It isusually assumed that all the elements included within battery limits qualify for thesame depreciation rate; this need not be the case in real life.
Erected offsites costAn estimated erected cost of offsites usually is not available at the early stages of a
project. Estimating the cost of offsites is difﬁcult, but not impossible. Two approachesare available:
rA gross estimation approach
rAn itemized estimation approach"
"The ﬁrst approach provides only a very rough estimate and makes use of some simplebut often unreliable guidelines. Essentially, these guidelines dictate that, if a plant isa grass-roots facility, the cost of the offsites is about the same as the cost of the plantwithin battery limits; if the plant is built on a developed site, the cost of the offsites isabout 30–50% of the cost of the plant within battery limits. These rules are good onlyto show an allowance for offsites, but are inadequate for quantiﬁcation purposes. Thescope of offsites to be built for a grass-roots facility can vary enormously from caseto case: tank age, ﬂare, feed water treatment, steam plant, power distribution center,cooling water facilities, efﬂuent treatment facilities, road terminals, rail terminals,marine terminals (jetties, etc.), canteen, shops, administration buildings, etc. just togive a few examples; units in remote locations may include “ offsites” such as workers’housing, sports, religious and recreational facilities, etc.
The second approach entails more work, but yields results that, at least, are more
justiﬁable. In this approach the various offsites and their capacities are itemized andcost estimating rules are applied. An example can be found in the guidelines providedby Chem Systems.
Interest during constructionThis concept is often ignored or overlooked. Unfortunately, it is a signiﬁcant amount
that greatly contributes to the ﬁnal erected cost of a unit or complex.856 CHAPTER 17
A unit is not built overnight. Expenditures normally accrue over the procurement,
fabrication, and construction period that, for a plant of average complexity, can usuallytake anywhere from 2 to 4 years. Not knowing further details, 2 years may be assumedfor relatively simple units and 3 years or more for more complex ones; very simpleunits may be assumed built in one to one-and-a-half years.
It is common practice to assume that the cost of the capital expenditures that accrue
over the construction period is covered by a short-term loan on a 100% debt basis.This assumption is not unreasonable: even if the funds are provided on an equity basis,the expenditures represent a short-term opportunity cost that can be accounted forthrough the short-term loan concept. It is true that, often, funds are provided through along-term loan, but this is of relatively little consequence over the construction period;assumption of a short-term loan at worst provides for a more conservative estimate.
How are the capital expenses allocated over the construction period? Unless actually
known, there is no common school of thought as to how construction costs ought tobe spread. Equal shares (i.e., one-third each over a three-year period) can be usedfor simplicity; others might prefer to use a 30%–50%–20% distribution over a 3-yearperiod to account for the fact that expenses tend to occur up-front.
Regardless of the way used to allocate capital over the construction period, the interest
charges accrued over this period are accumulated and capitalized (usually on a year-end basis) as part of the erected cost of the unit. If properly accounted for, separateallocations should be made for items within battery limits and for offsite items. In fact,because different individual items such as columns, heat exchangers, etc. may haveto be retired and replaced at different times over the life of the unit, a running countof interest expenses should be maintained for each individual piece of equipment.To provide an example in a similar, but unrelated, situation in a plane the jet engineshave a different depreciation schedule and tax treatment than the main body withinthe fuselage. It is therefore always advisable to account for the capitalization of asmany individual items as possible; it is not an impossible task with a relatively smallcomputer to keep track of events and charges.
RoyaltiesRoyalties are normally added to and capitalized with the plant investment even though
a different depreciation schedule may be used for royalties.
Adsorbent, catalyst, and metals inventoriesCatalyst base and metal make-up, additions and reprocessing costs should be han-
dled as an operating expense, along with chemicals and other consumables, in theproduction cost summary.ECONOMIC ANAL YSIS 857
A question arises as to how to handle a catalyst base inventory or an adsorbent
inventory, principally when the life of the catalyst or adsorbent is expected to spanseveral years.
Essentially there are two ways:
rWe can treat the catalyst as a consumable with the annual consumption calculated
by prorating the inventory over the expected life span of the catalyst. The catalystinventory itself can still be treated as a capital item for the purposes of calculatinginterest on capital, if the investment is leveraged.
rWe can treat the catalyst inventory purely as a capital item. The catalyst inventorycan then appear in the production cost summary as (a) an amortization term and
(b) interest on capital."
"Tax law considerations may favor or dictate which approach should be taken. Ingeneral, however, the latter approach is preferred; namely, the catalyst or adsorbentinventory is capitalized and amortized over its expected useful life. While, in principle,both approaches would seem to be numerically equivalent, the amortization approachhas a more favorable impact on the cash ﬂow since amortization is an add-backitem. Whenever allowable, this approach also makes it possible to use acceleratedamortization schedules.
Catalysts should never be amortized and treated as a consumable at the same time!
Those metals that are not recovered and are disposed of with the catalyst base are
treated as an integral part of the catalyst and accounted for as the catalyst base.
Metals— principally noble metals— that are recovered at the end of the useful life of
each catalyst batch are carried only as working capital and, therefore, appear in the
production cost summary only as an interest item.
Small metal losses incurred when the spent catalyst is reprocessed and the cost of
reprocessing itself can also be amortized over the useful life of the catalyst, but aremost often handled as operating expenses.
Catalyst stockpiled as inventory for future use is part of the working capital.Working capitalWorking capital items are those items that:
rrequire an additional front-end investment even though they are not part of the
physical plant
raccrue additional interest charges, usually in the form of short-term loans
rcan be recovered at the end of the useful life of the project858 CHAPTER 17
For timing purposes, working capital is usually assumed to be available upon com-
pletion of construction. The following items comprise the working capital in mosteconomic studies:
Additive items
Feedstock inventory
Supply of raw materials valued at delivered prices. Excluded are any materials thatare not normally stored (gases, for example). Unless speciﬁed otherwise, a 1/2 monthsupply or equivalent liquid and solid feedstock storage is assumed.
Finished product inventory
Supply of principal products and by-products, if any, valued on a gross cost of pro-duction basis. Again, a 1/2 month storage is assumed unless differently speciﬁed.Excluded too are items that are not normally stored (e.g., hydrogen or light ends).
Accounts receivable
Typically it is assumed to consist of one-month’ s worth of production. Productionincludes main products, by-products, and any other items that might be sold on aregular basis.
Cash on hand
Typically estimated as the equivalent of one week’ s cash ﬂow.
Adsorbent, catalyst, and metals
Normally, only those items that are fully recoverable, and thus not amortizable, arepart of the working capital. Typical is the inventory of noble metals in the plant.
Warehouse and spare parts inventory
Any spare items kept in storage on a regular basis are included as part of the workingcapital. Excluded are items ordered and kept in storage on a short-term temporary basisuntil installed. Typical working capital items would be spare loads of adsorbents orcatalysts and spare parts such as compressor rotors, rotary valve gaskets, replacementpumps, etc. Since a detailed inventory of spare parts is not usually available for apreliminary economic analysis, it is common practice to assume that the total amountsto, say, 2 or 3% of the erected cost within battery limits.
Subtractive items
Accounts payable
Typically assumed as one month’ s worth of raw materials and other consumables atdelivered prices.ECONOMIC ANAL YSIS 859
Cost of production
The concepts usually included as part of the Cost of Production summary were item-
ized in the opening section. Essentially, they were grouped under ﬁve major sections:
rVariable costs
MaterialsUtilities
rOperating costs
rOperating expenses
rCapital items
rTaxes
V ariable costs
Variable costs are those that can be directly associated with the production process
as concerns the consumption of materials and services or utilities. A characteristic ofvariable costs is that they are roughly proportional to the amounts produced. Thus, ifthe total annual production were to increase by, say, 20%, the annual variable costswould be expected to also increase by roughly 20% (any differences would be due tochanges in production efﬁciencies only) so as to maintain a uniform variable cost ofproduction per unit item. Typical variable costs of production are:
rRaw materials costs
rCatalysts and chemicals
rUtility requirements
and, in general, any other consumables expended in the production process.
Although not part of the costs, it is customary practice to subtract here any variable
credits such as:
rBy-product credits
rUtility credits
More appropriately, these concepts should be entered under a separate heading ofvariable credits.
If the establishment of a cost of production is the main objective of the analysis, all"
"the various costs are added up to the ﬁnal grand total. If, on the other hand, it is desiredto calculate an income or cash ﬂow result, the various costs will be added up and theresult subtracted from a base term that will comprise the revenue generated by theproduction of all major products or co-products assumed sold at prevailing marketprices estimated at an equivalent production level from other manufacturers.860 CHAPTER 17
Operating costs and operating expenses
These are typically ﬁxed operating charges unless there is a major revision of the
plant’ s operating conditions. Typical items are:
rLabor
rMaintenance
rPlant insurance
rProperty taxes
rDirect overhead
rGeneral plant overhead
rSales and administration expenses
and, possibly, many others depending on an individual plant’ s characteristics and
accounting basis. In general, all these expenses are ﬁxed in that they remain about the
same on an annual basis irrespective of the plant’ s actual running capacity. Naturally,if business is poor and production rates are low on a consistent or extended basis, wecan expect that measures will be taken to lower these charges to the extent that it maybe feasible (e.g., reduction in labor through lay-offs or reduction in overheads throughsome other belt-tightening measures) but, in general, changes in these concepts willalways be limited, short of shutting down the plant.
Labor
Labor includes the personnel required at various skill levels to operate the unit ona 24-hr basis. Since shifts usually run for 8 hr, a minimum of three operators arerequired to staff each position. Actually, because of holidays, vacation, leave time,etc. the stafﬁng requirements are considerably higher.
An average year of 365.25 days consists of 8766 hr. The basic work load per individual
at 8 hr/day and 5 days/week is about 2090 hr/year, corresponding to an average of 4.2operators/shift. This value is often seen in economic estimates, but is not quite correct.If we instead estimate the time off as follows:
days/year
Weekends 104
Vacation (3 week average) 15
Holidays 10
Sick leave (estimate) 10
139
The corresponding annual workload is 1,810 hr. Therefore, the number of individuals
required to ﬁll each shift position is 4.84 (say 4.8) rather than 4.2.ECONOMIC ANAL YSIS 861
Labor rates are those prevailing within a particular geographical area. Base labor rates
are typically used. Fringe beneﬁts, often estimated at 35–45% of base labor rates, aremore commonly accounted for as direct overhead.
Supervision, including overall supervision and shift foremen, is frequently estimated
as 25% of labor. Otherwise, one foreman per shift may be assumed together with onesingle overall supervisor on a day shift basis only.
Maintenance
Maintenance labor and maintenance materials are always accounted for as a percent-age of the investment cost within battery limits (ISBL). This percentage may be ashigh as 4 or 7%, but it should be estimated based on past experience. Often an al-lowance of 3% and in many cases as low as 2% is often sufﬁcient for most of reﬁneryor petrochemical units built according to heavy duty speciﬁcations (e.g., API). Theperiodic replacement of parts due to corrosion, wear, etc. should be accounted for aspart of the overall annual maintenance allowance.
Property taxes and plant insurance
It is customary to estimate the total of these charges at about 2% of the plant erectedcost within battery limits (EEC). (Others may use, say, 1.5% of ﬁxed investment,including battery limits, and offsites.)
Direct overhead
Direct overhead in its usual interpretation consists of fringe beneﬁts and other laborrelated concepts (personnel department, etc.). It is often allowed for at 35–45% ofthe total charges for labor and supervision. Some estimates include direct overheadas part of labor expenses.
General plant overhead
This allowance is best estimated based on past experience; it may vary considerablydepending on each company’ s practice. A common practice is to assign to it, say, 65%of the total of labor and maintenance. Others may use, say, 80% of labor.
The general plant overhead concept is meant to include the costs of operating shops,
labs, etc. as they are allocated to the operation of the plant. Research and analyticalexpenses are often allocated also as part of plant overhead unless accounted forseparately.
Sales and administration
In order to avoid further complexity it is best to assume that these expenses areincluded as part of the general plant overhead. At times, however, this is not practical,principally if the plant is part of a more extensive organization. A corporate overheadentry may be included in these cases. If not part of the general plant overhead, sales,862 CHAPTER 17
and administration can then be assumed to be part of corporate overhead. At other
times a cost of sales, say 5%, is allocated as a percentage of product revenue.
The actual accounting for this item is largely immaterial except for those few cases"
"when one wishes to distinguish a cost of production from a cost of manufacturing,thus making a distinction between plant-related costs and other extraneous costs.
Capital itemsCapital items are those directly related to the plant investment and include:
rDepreciation
rAmortization
rInterest on capital
rInterest on working capital
Depreciation and amortization expenses are signiﬁcant in that they are substantial, but
are not real. Thus, while both depreciation and amortization charges are subtractedin order to calculate a net (pre-tax or post-tax) income, they in no way affect the cashﬂow out of the unit and, therefore, are added back for the purpose of determining thecash ﬂow.
Depreciation
Depreciation represents a capital recovery. As such, it is a certain amount of moneyrelated to the capital investment spent up-front that is set aside on a regular basis,without interest, over a certain period of time to represent the recovery of the originalcapital.
Depreciation is accounted for separately, apart from any return-on-capital (ROI). The
reasoning behind this practice is that, as the plant ages, provision should be madeto accumulate capital for its eventual replacement. Obviously, in actual practice,ﬁnancing of an actual replacement, if any, will rarely depend on capital accumulatedin such a manner. If viewed as a capital build-up for plant replacement, depreciationwould be equivalent to a zero-interest sinking fund.
Apart from philosophical interpretations, the real value of depreciation is that it is
almost universally tax deductible. On the basis that depreciation represents a gradualrecovery of the original capital, it is regarded as not being part of the proﬁts generatedby the plant and, therefore, not subject to taxation.
An interesting— and legal— dichotomy arises at this point. From an actual operating
viewpoint one wishes to show as much proﬁt as possible and, therefore, as littledepreciation as possible. However, from a tax viewpoint, one wishes to maximizedepreciation so as to minimize the immediate tax liability. This is the only placeECONOMIC ANAL YSIS 863
where two perfectly legal and different accounting methods can be applied that lead
to different results.
For ﬁnancial reporting purposes, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
in the United States dictates what minimum depreciation levels should be used. Ifnot subject to any particular requirements, it is customary to use 10-year straight-linedepreciation for plant equipment and 20-year straight-line depreciation for (most)offsites. (Sometimes, however, in order to bring depreciation schedules closer tothose used for tax accounting 5- and 10-year straight-line depreciations are used forplant and offsites, respectively.)
For tax accounting purposes it is advisable to use whichever fastest rate of depreciation
is allowable under the local current tax laws. (Whenever allowed, it may be advisableto start with the fastest rate of accelerated depreciation allowable and later, whenthe amount to be depreciated is relatively small, switch to, say, straight-line so as toprolong the depreciation beneﬁts.) The golden rule in tax accounting is
pay the least and the latest...within the law!
Since tax effects are ignored in most of our representations, this discussion is largelyirrelevant. However, when tax effects are included it becomes apparent that the taxliability incurred under ﬁnancial accounting principles is much higher than the taxactually paid. This gives rise to a deferred tax liability. The reasoning is that eventuallythis deferred tax will have to be paid; in actual practice, if sufﬁcient capital items areadded or replaced over the life of the plant, depreciation can be rolled over so as tolargely neutralize the effects of deferred tax liabilities.
Amortization
Amortization is akin to depreciation. Amortization is the general term for the processof allocating the acquisition cost of assets to the periods of beneﬁts as expenses. It iscalled depreciation for plant assets, depletion for wasting assets or natural resources,and amortization for intangibles.
We use the general term amortization to allocate expenses for the initial catalyst
inventory costs. (In the sense that a catalyst life is relatively brief we could think ofthis amortization as a depletion allowance.)
It is customary to amortize the catalyst inventory over its estimated useful life, irre-
spective of what the actual life might be.
Interest on capital
Though very important in real life, interest on capital should not be used in a prelim-inary economic analysis.864 CHAPTER 17
Most commercial plants are heavily leveraged; namely, most plant owners choose to"
"borrow as much capital as possible instead of investing their own money. Usually,the ﬁnal investment will consist of a certain amount of debt (amount borrowed aslong-term loans) and the rest equity (investors’capital). If the return-on-capital iscalculated relative to equity, its value is distorted by the relative percentage of debt.For example, if the plant is ﬁnanced through 100% debt, a net return of $1.00 willrepresent an inﬁnite rate of return for the investors who have exposed none of theirown capital.
Also, the interest paid on capital ultimately is part of the plant return-on-investment
and should be added back to the usual return-on-investment calculation in a traditionalanalysis.
Finally, if interest on capital must be used, it should be used on an average interest
basis as explained in Appendix 17.2.4. The base interest rate, typically the prime rateapplicable to a large long-term loan, will be averaged over the pre-established life ofthe loan or calculated on a year-to-year basis if a cash ﬂow analysis is performed overtime.
Interest on working capital
Working capital is normally assumed carried as 100% debt. Because of its nature,working capital revolves somewhat like a line of credit and, therefore, is more rep-resentative of a short-term loan for which a higher rate of interest applies than for along-term loan. Also, there is no interest averaging for working capital loans as theyare assumed renewed on a year-to-year basis.
Reporting parameters
Several terms are often used for reporting purposes:Cost basisThe summation of all costs without capital items leads to what is called the cash cost
of production. The cash cost of production represents the total of raw materials costs,chemicals and catalysts costs, utility costs, operating costs, and overheads.
The net cost of production is obtained by taking the cash cost of production and
adding capital items: depreciation and amortization. As indicated above, intereston capital should not be used; interest on working capital may or may not be in-cluded at this point depending on individual practice. It is customary to include it,but others prefer to calculate cash ﬂows on a total equity basis, including workingcapital.ECONOMIC ANAL YSIS 865
Return basis
The simplest parameter is the return-on-investment (ROI). This simply is the differ-
ence between product revenue (product value) and net production cost divided by thetotal investment. For this purpose, total investment is normally viewed as total ﬁxedinvestment or total plant investment. Total ﬁxed investment is the plant investment(EEC) within battery limits (ISBL) plus the plant investment outside battery limits(OSBL). EEC may be used instead of total ﬁxed investment if clearly understood andagreed upon that this is the case. ROI’ s are normally calculated on a pre-tax basis;they can also be estimated on a post-tax basis, if desired. Royalties and interest duringconstruction should be included as part of the total plant investment.
A second simple return parameter often used is pay-out time (or pay-back time). This
represents the ratio of total ﬁxed or plant investment to operating cash ﬂow. (This typeof pay-out time will not agree with the pay-out times calculated on a discounted cashﬂow (DCF) basis.)
Typical rules of thumb are that a new smallish project is attractive if a, say, 25%
pre-tax ROI can be obtained. If this is coupled with overall depreciation estimated at10% (10-year straight-line), the corresponding simple pay-out time is about 3 years.Very large, expensive projects may be justiﬁed with longer pay-out times of about 5or even 7 or more years.
Higher pre-tax ROIs and shorter pay-out times are usually required for revamps or
retroﬁts. Typical 1–2 years maximum pay-out times are often required for revampprojects, again depending on their relative magnitude.
Other parametersOther common reporting parameters are:
rdiscounted cash ﬂow (DCF) rate of return (internal rate of return)
rrequired sales price for a given DCF rate of return
rcash ﬂow pay-out time
These parameters are associated with the use of discounting over a time series of cash
ﬂows.
Cash ﬂow analysisThe previous section examined the economic summary prepared at one particular
point in time, usually a “ typical”production year. In this section we examine theeconomic analysis extended over an extended period of operation, usually 10 or20 years.866 CHAPTER 17
The basis for the analysis is identical to what has been said before, so there is no need
to repeat it here. All that needs to be discussed is the discounting effect over time.
Acash ﬂow analysis is anet present value analysis. If we assume an initial outﬂow
or investment at time zero, the total of the net present values of all future cash ﬂows
must exceed the initial investment for the project to be attractive.
Obviously, the result will be highly dependent on the rate of discounting used to bring"
"future cash ﬂows to time zero. What rate of discounting should be used? We shoulduse a rate of discounting equivalent to the money market rate; namely, the rate ofreturn that we would obtain if we were to grant a loan to others. On this basis, then,the appropriate rate of discounting is equivalent to the long-term interest rate that wewould be charged for any debt incurred in connection with the construction of the plant.The rate of discounting should be increased above this value if we feel that the projectinvolves risks such as market potential, future obsolescence of the project, etc.
If, when we use this rate of discounting, the net present value of all future cash
ﬂows exceeds the net present value of all investments (initial and future, if any), theproject is regarded as proﬁtable relative to a passive interest generating activity. Ifthe net present value of all future cash ﬂows is less than the net present value of theinvestments, the project is relatively less attractive than a passive interest generatingactivity.
One may ask, if a project is attractive at a certain rate of discounting, what would
be the rate of discounting that renders the project unattractive? The break-even rateof return at which the summation of the net present values of all future cash ﬂows(inﬂows) just equals the net present value of the outﬂows (investments, etc.) is theso-called internal rate of return (IRR). If, therefore, the IRR exceeds the discountingrate, the project may be regarded as proﬁtable and economically attractive. If it doesnot, the project is not attractive or less attractive. The IRR has no real meaning of itsown; it must always be viewed relative to the appropriate discount rate.
The IRR is also called the discounted cash ﬂow rate of return or DCF rate of return or
DCFRR. Everything else being the same, one can raise or lower the IRR by adjustingthe sale price of the product and, therefore, the projected revenue. If we then ﬁxthe desired IRR, we can calculate the necessary sale price. The desired IRR shouldeventually be higher than the discounting rate as explained above.
There is a further complexity. Sometimes, one wishes to examine the overall return
over an extended period— say, 10 or 20 years. Whether we consider an active activity(i.e., a plant investment) or a passive activity (i.e., a loan to others) the capital isalways returned in discrete parcels over this period. What becomes of this capitalonce it is returned? Logically, one can expect that it will be reinvested but, at whatECONOMIC ANAL YSIS 867
rate? Treatments found in the literature often assume that the capital that is returned
can be reinvested at the same rate of return as the original project. This tends to beunrealistic, principally for highly proﬁtable projects; a more conservative approachis to assume that the capital that is returned can be reinvested at a then prevailingrate (constant or varied, depending on the desired complexity) so as to generate afund at the end of the economic analysis timeframe. This fund can then be discountedto time zero to add to the overall cash ﬂow. Depending on the choice of rates anddiscount rates, this adjustment can have a positive or negative effect on the overallanalysis.
It is often customary to assume a gradual sales build-up. For example, 60% of capacity
the ﬁrst year, 80% the second year, and 100% the third year and thereafter. A simplecomputer program can easily keep track of this and any other assumptions. For thesake of simplicity, however, we normally assume a uniform production capacity overthe entire period of 10 or 20 years.
Tax accounting, whenever desired, should be done on an extended discounted cash
ﬂow basis. In this format it is easier to keep track of such terms as ﬁnancial deprecia-tion, tax depreciation, tax liability, taxes paid, carryover losses, investment tax credits,etc. so as to be able to determine the actual cash ﬂow every year. Even if done on aconstant-dollar basis, the annual cash ﬂows can be expected to vary from year-to-year.A discounted cash ﬂow analysis can easily keep track of such variations. Again, forsimplicity, the concept can be explained equally well if we assume a uniform streamof cash ﬂows.
It is helpful to visualize expenses and cash ﬂows as a series of arrows: positive arrows
for positive cash ﬂows (net inﬂows) and negative arrows for outﬂows such as capitalinvestment and negative cash ﬂows. We start with a fully capitalized investment ﬁgureat time zero, the start of production.
Letnbe the total number of periods. For simplicity, let us assume that n are years and
that we consider either 10 or 20 years.LetIrepresent the initial investment at time zero and CF the annual cash ﬂow that is
assumed uniform on a constant-dollar basis (i.e., no inﬂation).The internal rate of return (IRR) is that at which the cash ﬂows over nyears just pay
back the invested capital, or, equivalently, when the capital equals the stream of net
present values:
I=CF
1+r+CF"
"(1+r)2+···+CF
(1+r)n(a)868 CHAPTER 17
Then, by using the summation formula (Appendix 17.2.2), we can write:
I=CF(1+r)n−1
r(1+r)nor CF =Ir(1+r)n
(1+r)n−1(b)
Internal rate of return
In the formulas above, given I,n, and CF , ﬁnd r. The calculated rate of return, r,
is the “ internal rate of return”of the project over a period of n years. Note that it
varies with the number of years and it increases with the number of years. Thus,the IRR calculated for 20 years will be slightly higher than the IRR calculated for10 years.
Computers use an iterative built-in function to calculate the IRR, often in the form:
@irr(0.15, −I,CF
1,CF2,CF3,...,CF n)
Where “ 0.15”is an initial guess that should be modiﬁed if the function does not
converge in some 20 iterations. −I is the initial investment expressed as a negative
number and CFs are the values of the annual cash ﬂows.
Some software packages require that the cash ﬂow numbers be entered in a separate
array of cells; others allow for direct input.
The summation formula (b) derived above only applies if the annual cash ﬂows are
uniform. The net present value summation (a) applies however even if the CFs varyfrom year-to-year. The @irr function also accepts variable annual CFs.
Discounted pay-back time
Given I,r, and CF , ﬁnd n. This calculated n is a discounted pay-back time. The
simple pay-back time ( I/CF) is equivalent to a discounted pay-back time when r=0
(i.e., with no discounting). Likewise, if we calculate IRR for, say, n=20, and then
we set r=IRR, we will just back-calculate n=20. Therefore, for 0 <r<IRR,
the calculated pay back time will be ( I/CF)<n<20. Likewise, if r>IRR, then
n>20.
If the cash ﬂows, CF , are uniform, we can solve for nas follows:
n=ln/bracketleftBigCF
CF−Ir/bracketrightBig
ln (1+r).ECONOMIC ANAL YSIS 869
Sales price required to obtain a given discounted cash ﬂow rate or return
Given I,n, and a desired rate of return, r, we can calculate the required cash ﬂow,
CF , according to formula (b). This cash ﬂow can be used in the economic analysis to
calculate the product sales price that will be necessary to generate this cash ﬂow. If thiscash ﬂow is obtained, then we have the desired discounted cash ﬂow rate of return, r.
This calculated sales price is a function of both randn.
For the calculation of the cash ﬂow, CF , the appropriate computer function, if available,is:
@pmt( I,r,n)
where rmust be used in the decimal form for the corresponding period.
APPENDIX 17.2.1
Background for economic calculations
The following summary provides the background necessary for most economic cal-
culations and should be used for reference as needed.
First of all, let us consider the following terms:
P present value of a sum of money or a series of sums
F future value of a sum of money or a series of sums
C capital (investment or loan) at one given time
A sum of money every compounding period
n number of compounding periods
i annual rate of interest
r rate of interest per compounding period
L salvage value
The rate of interest per compounding period (r) should be used in all cases.
The interest rate stated legally is the nominal annual rate ( i). If the compounding
period is less than one year, the rate of interest per compounding period is obtained
by dividing the nominal annual rate, i, by the number of compounding periods in a
year. It is done this way by law.
A commercial year is understood to consist of 360 days. Likewise, a generic commer-
cial month consists of 30 days. Thus, if the compounding is done daily, the annual870 CHAPTER 17
rate of interest, i, will have to be divided by 360; if monthly, the annual rate will be
divided by 12, irrespective of the month. Note, however, that the amount compounded
over a period of time will be calculated on the basis of the actual days. Thus, 28 daysfor a normal February, 31 days for May, 365 days for a normal year or 366 days for aleap year.
Future value
F
n=P(1+r)n
Fn, or simply F, represents the value at the end of the nth period of a sum of money,
P, at time zero (e.g., present time).
The factor, (1 +r)n, is sometimes called the ( F/P) factor or the “ compound amount
factor for a single sum,” (CAFS). Thus,
F=P(F/P)r
n
or
F=P(CAFS)r
n
Present value
The present value, P, of a future sum of money, Fn, represents the reciprocal of the
future value calculation.
P=Fn1
(1+r)n
The reciprocal factor is also called the (P/F) factor or the “ present worth factor for asingle sum,” (PWFS). Thus,
P=F(P/F)
r
n
or
P=F(PWFS)r
n
In all these formulas the compounding becomes effective at the end of the period.
This is true in all the expressions used in economic calculations; modiﬁed formulasare needed if the compounding becomes effective at the beginning of the period,but this is seldom, if ever, the case. The formula modiﬁcation, if needed, involves a(1+r) factor.
Future value of a uniform series of payments (made at the end of each period)See Appendices B and C for justiﬁcation.ECONOMIC ANAL YSIS 871"
"If the amount paid at the end of each period is A, the future value, Fn, of the sum is
given by:
Fn=A(1+r)n−1
r
The multiplier is also known as the (F/A) factor or the “ compound amount factor for
a uniform series,” (CAFUS).
F=A(F/A)r
n
or
F=A(CAFUS)r
n
Sinking fundsA sinking fund consists of a series of payments made for the purpose of accumulatinga given amount of money, F, at some future time. As usual, we assume a uniform
series of payments, Abeing the amount paid at the end of each period. The calculation
assumes that the rate of interest does not change over time; trial-and-error would berequired otherwise.
In order to accumulate an amount F
nat the end of nperiods, the amount Ato be
deposited at the end of each period is:
A=Fnr
(1+r)n−1
This is the reciprocal of the future value of a series of uniform payments.The multiplier is at times called the ( A/F) factor or the “ sinking fund factor” (SFF).
Thus,
A=F(A/F)
r
n
or
A=F(SFF)r
n
As used in economic estimates, depreciation and amortization are essentially sinking
funds at zero rate of interest. Again, to repeat, no item should ever be treated both asa sinking fund amortization and as an expense at the same time.
Loan repayments
The loan repayment calculation, or “ mortgage formula,”is one of the most usefulexpressions in economic calculations. It is a combination of the previous cases. Itrepresents the series of uniform payments, A, to be made at the end of each period to
repay a loan, P, taken out at time zero. In this situation, the present value, P, often is
just denoted by “ capital” C.872 CHAPTER 17
The derivation of the formula is given in Appendices B and C.
A=Pr(1+r)n
(1+r)n−1
The multiplier is also variously known as the (A/P) factor or the “ capital recovery
factor” (CRF).
A=P(A/P)r
n
or
A=P(CRF)r
n
It ought to be very clear what these formulas mean. A, the uniform series of pay-
ments, represents a constant amount paid to the lender at the end of each compoundperiod. This quantity, A, is made up of two variable parts: a capital return part and
an interest payment part. The capital return part represents a very small fraction atthe beginning of the loan repayment period, but it increases slowly (and nonlinearly)until it becomes the dominant term toward the end. Conversely, the interest paymentterm is proportionately very large at the beginning of the loan repayment period anddecreases progressively until it becomes small at the end.
This formula is predicated on the idea of making uniform payments, as is often done
with mortgages; hence the name. Naturally, there are many other ways of repayingloans and expressions could be derived for other situations too, if desired.
An offshoot of the mortgage formula is the concept of an “ average rate of interest,”
sometimes used in economic calculations to reﬂect the average cost of long-term debt.See Appendix 17.2.4 for this concept.
Present value of a uniform series
Logically, this represents the reciprocal of the loan repayment schedule.
P=A(1+r)
n−1
r(1+r)n.
The multiplier is also called the (P/A) factor or the “ present worth factor for a uniform
series,” (PWFUS).
P=A(P/A)r
n
or
P=A(PWFUS)r
n
The above expressions represent most of the situations encountered in economicevaluations. There are other expressions available for other situations (e.g., whenthe series of payments increases or decreases progressively at a uniform rate— the“ gradient” method), but these are far rarer and need not be discussed here.ECONOMIC ANAL YSIS 873
APPENDIX 17.2.2
Progressions
Though trivial, the concept of arithmetic and geometric progressions is useful in
economic calculations. These concepts are outlined in as a refresher.
Arithmetic progressions
An arithmetic progression (or an arithmetic series) is a series of terms such that each
is made up of the previous term plus an additive (positive or negative) constant.
The following series is an arithmetic progression:
T e r m : 1 2 3 4 ... n
Value: aa +qa +2qa +3q... a+(n−1)q
where ais the ﬁrst term and qis the constant addendum.
As seen, the nth term of an arithmetic progression is given by:
b=a+(n−1)q
The sum of the ﬁrst nterms of an arithmetic progression is:
S=(a+b)n
2
There is a spurious anecdote attributed to child Gauss who, having been punished by
his teacher along with his school mates to add the ﬁrst 100 numbers, he immediatelycame up with the answer, 5,050. Supposedly, he had just observed that 1 +100=101,
2+99=101, and so on to 50 +51=101. Since there are 50 such pairs, the answer
is immediate.
Geometric progressions
Geometric progressions (or geometric series) are of more interest for economic cal-culations.
A geometric progression is a series of terms such that each term is the previous one
multiplied by a constant factor.
T e r m : 1 2 3 4 ... n
Value aa qa q
2aq3... aq(n−1)874 CHAPTER 17
Therefore, the nth term of a geometric progression is given by:
b=aq(n−1)
More importantly, the sum of the ﬁrst n terms is:
S=bq−a
q−1
or
S=aqn−a
q−1=aqn−1
q−1"
"Often q<1. In this case, both the numerator and the denominator will be negative
and, for comfort, we can write:
S=a1−qn
1−q
These expressions are the basis for the mortgage formula and many other economic
calculations.
APPENDIX 17.2.3
Loan repayments (mortgage formula)
Let us assume that we have borrowed a certain amount of money, C, that we plan to
return over a total of n periods such that at the end of each period we repay the same
amount, A. We further assume that the rate of interest remains constant and is rfor
each period.
Time zero
Take the loan out. We owe C.
End of the ﬁrst period
We owe C(1+r). We repay an amount A. Therefore, we now owe C(1+r)−A.
End of the second periodWe owe [ C(1+r)−A](1+r)=C(1+r)
2−A(1+r). Again we repay an amount
A. Therefore, we now owe C(1+r)2−A(1+r)−A.
End of the third periodAfter repaying the amount A,w eo w e[ C(1+r)
2−A(1+r)−A](1+r)−A,o r
C(1+r)3−A[(1+r)2+(1+r)+1].ECONOMIC ANAL YSIS 875
Keep repeating the reasoning for all other intermediate periods.
End of the nth period
After making the last payment, A,w eo w e C(1+r)n−A[(1+r)(n−1)+(1+r)(n−2)
+···+ (1+r)+1]. But since we are repaying the loan in nperiods, at this time the
balance must be zero!
By applying the summation formulas in Appendix 17.2.2, we can rewrite this as:
C(1+r)n−A(1+r)n−1
(1+r)−1=0
or
C(1+r)n=A(1+r)n−1
r
or, solving for A:
A=Cr(1+r)n
(1+r)n−1
which is the “ mortgage” formula as seen in Appendix 17.2.1. All other formulas in
Appendix A can be derived in a like manner.
APPENDIX 17.2.4
Average rate of interest
The “ average rate of interest”is a concept that arises when a loan is repaid over a
number of time periods, but we wish to conduct a preliminary economic analysisover one of the time periods only. We saw in Appendix 17.2.1, Item 5, that, if auniform series of payments is used, the actual amounts paid as interest vary from ahigh at the beginning to relatively small amounts toward the end. The question thenis: what is the “ average” amount of interest paid over a typical period? This value isnormally calculated by adding up all the interest payments and simply prorating themby dividing the sum over the total number of periods. Calculation of this value hasinterest in cases when the capital may be strongly leveraged (i.e., a high percentageof debt) since, obviously, the average interest paid will be less than the interest paid
over the ﬁrst period on the basis of the total amount of debt outstanding.
How much interest is paid over the life of the loan? Since we have borrowed a capital
Cand we have made a total of npayments of Adollars each, the difference between
the amount paid and the capital borrowed must be the amount paid as interest.
Total interest paid =nA−C876 CHAPTER 17
Therefore, the average amount paid out as interest every compounding period is:
Average interest payment =A−C
n
or, on a percentage basis relative to C, we obtain:
Average rate of interest =A
C−1
n
This rate is per compounding period; it should be annualized by multiplying it by the
number of compounding periods in one year.
What is the effect of using interest averaging? Just to give an example, a 10 year
loan at 10% compounded annually ( A=0.1627454, if C=1) represents an average
annual interest of only 6.27%.Chapter 18
Process equipment in petroleum reﬁning
D.S.J. Jones
Introduction
This chapter deals with the items of equipment normally met with in the petroleum
reﬁning industry. Indeed, many of the items that will be described and discussed hereare also common to many other process industries. Knowledge of these equipmentitems are essential for good reﬁnery design, operation, and troubleshooting whennecessary. The equipment described here falls into the following categories, and willbe presented in the following parts:
Part 1 Vessels
Part 2 PumpsPart 3 CompressorsPart 4 Heat ExchangersPart 5 Fired Heaters
These sections will include a description of the various types, an in depth discussion,
and design features. They will also provide an example of the data sheet usuallyforwarded to manufacturers for the items required. Invariably in reﬁnery technicallibraries these data sheets are included as part of the ‘ Mechanical Catalogues’andsupported by narrative speciﬁcations which give details of metallurgy and fabricationcodes etc. These catalogues are provided by the equipment supplier and are part ofall the information dossier on each item. Included also are such items as installationdetails, start-up procedures, routine maintenance procedures and the like. In mostreﬁneries today the catalogues are kept on computer discs or microﬁlm.
18.1 V essels
This section address the pressure vessels that are common to most reﬁneries. These
include:

rColumns and Towers
rKnock out Drums and Separators
rAccumulators and Surge vessels
Storage tanks have been dealt with in Chapter 13 of this Handbook.
Fractionators, trays, and packings"
"Trayed towersColumns normally constitute the major cost in any chemical process conﬁguration.
Consequently it is required to exercise utmost care in handling this item of equipment.This extends to the actual design of the vessel or evaluating a design offered by others.Normally columns are used in a process for fractionation, extraction or absorptionas unit operations. Columns contain internals which may be trays, or packing. Bothtypes of columns will also contain suitable inlet dispersion nozzles, outlet nozzles,instrument nozzles, and access facilities (such as manholes or handholes). This itemdeals with the trayed towers.
Tray types
There are three types of trays in common use today. These are:
rBubble cap
rSieve
rValve
Bubble cap trays
This type of tray was in wide use up until the mid to late 1950s. Their predominancewas displaced by the cheaper sieve and valve trays. The bubble cap tray consists ofa series of risers on the tray which are capped by a serrated metal dome. Figure 18.1shows two types of caps. One is used in normal fractionation service while the otheris designed for vacuum distillation service. Vapor rises up through the risers into thebubble cap. It is then forced down through the serrated edge or, in some cases, slotsat the bottom of the cap. A liquid level is maintained on the tray to be above the slotsor serrations of the cap. The vapor therefore is forced out in ﬁne bubbles into thisliquid phase thereby mixing with the liquid. Mass and heat transfer between vaporand liquid is enhanced by this mixing action to effect the fractionation mechanism.
Capacity. Moderately high with high efﬁciency.
Efﬁciency. Very efﬁcient over a wide capacity range.Figure 18.1. Bubble cap design.880 CHAPTER 18
Entrainment. Much higher than perforated type trays due to the “ Jet”action that
accompanies the bubbling.
Flexibility. Has the highest ﬂexibility both for vapor and liquid rates. Liquid heads
are maintained by weirs.Application. May be used for all services except for those conditions where coking or
polymer formation occur. In this case Bafﬂe or Disc & Donut trays should be used.Note: Because of the relatively high liquid level required by this type of tray it incurs
a higher pressure drop than most other types of trays. This is a critical factor in tray
selection for vacuum units.
Tray Spacing. Usually 18
/prime/primeto 24/prime/prime. For Vacuum service this should be about 30/prime/primeto 36/prime/prime.
Sieve trays
This is the simplest of the various types of trays. It consists of holes suitably arrangedand punched out of a metal plate. The vapor from the tray below rises through theholes to mix with the liquid ﬂowing across the tray. Fairly uniform mixing of the liquidand vapor occurs and allows for the heat/mass transfer of the fractionation mechanismto occur. The liquid ﬂows across a weir at one end of the tray through a downcomerto the tray below.
Capacity. As high as or higher than bubble cap trays at design vapor/liquid rates.
Performance drops off rapidly at rates below 60% of design.Efﬁciency. High efﬁciency at design rates to about 120% of design. The efﬁciency
falls off rapidly to around 50–60% of design rate. This is due to “ weeping” which is
the liquid leaking from the tray through the sieve holes.
Entrainment. Only about one-third of that for bubble cap trays.
Flexibility. Not suitable for trays operating at variable loads.
Application. In most mass transfer operations where high capacities in vapor and
liquid rates are required. Handles suspended solids and other fouling media well.Tray spacing. Requires less tray spacing than bubble cap. Usually spacing is rarely
less than 15
/prime/primealthough some services can operate at 10/prime/primeand 12/prime/prime. In vacuum service
a spacing of 20/prime/primeto 30/prime/primeis acceptable.
V alve trays
These trays have downcomers to handle the liquid trafﬁc and holes with ﬂoating capsthat handle the vapor trafﬁc. The holes may be round or rectangular and the caps overthe holes are moveable within the limits of the length of the “ legs” which ﬁt into thePROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 881

holes. Figures 18.2 and 18.3 show the type of valves and valve trays offered by Glitsch
as their “ Ballast” trays.
Valve trays are by far the most common type of tray used in the chemical industry
today. The tray has good efﬁciency and a much better ﬂexibility in terms of turn downthan the sieve or bubble cap trays. Its only disadvantage over the sieve tray is that itis slightly more expensive and cannot handle excessive fouling as well as the sievetray. The remainder of this item will now be dedicated to the sizing and analysis ofthe valve tray tower.882 CHAPTER 18
Figure 18.2. (Cont.)
Trayed tower sizing
The height of a trayed tower is determined by the number of trays it contains, the liquid"
"surge level at the bottom of the tower, and the tray spacing. The number of trays isa function of the thermodynamic mechanism for the fractionation or absorption dutyrequired to be performed. This is described in Chapters 3 and 4 of this Handbook.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 883
Figure 18.3. Valve trays— Glitsch Ballast.
The diameter of the tower is based on allowable vapor and liquid ﬂow in the tower and
the type of tray. This section now deals with determining the tower diameter usingvalve trays.
The “quickie” method
This method is good enough for a reasonable estimate of a tower diameter which can
be used for a budget type cost estimate or initial plant layout studies. The steps usedfor this calculation are as follows:884 CHAPTER 18
Figure 18.4. Tray spacing versus ‘ K’factor.
Step 1. Establish the liquid and vapor ﬂows for the critical trays in the section of
the tower that will give the maximum values. These are obtained by heat balances
(see Chapters 3 and 4 of this Handbook). The critical trays are:
The top tray.
Any side stream draw off tray.Any intermediate reﬂux draw off tray.The bottom tray.
Step 2. Calculate the actual cuft/hr at tray conditions of the vapor. Then using the
total mass per hour of the vapor calculate its vapor density in lbs/cuft.
Step 3. From the heat balance determine the density of the liquid on the tray at tray
temperature in lbs/cuft.
Step 4. Select a tray spacing. Start with a 24
/prime/primespace. Read from Figure 18.4 a value for
‘ K’on the ﬂood line. Using the equation:
Gf=K/radicalbig
((ρv×(ρl−ρv))PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 885
where
Gf=mass vapor velocity in lbs/hr sqft at ﬂood,
K=the constant read from the ﬂood curve in Figure 18.4,
ρv=density of vapor at tray conditions in lbs/cuft,
ρL=density of liquid at tray conditions in lbs/cuft.
Step 5. Multiply Gfby 0.82 to give mass velocity at 82% of ﬂood which is the normal
recommended design ﬁgure. Divide the actual vapor rate in lbs/hr by the vapor
mass velocity to give the area of the tray. Calculate tray diameter from this area.
An example calculation now follows.
Example calculation
Calculate the diameter of the tower to handle the liquid and vapor loads as follows:
Vapor to tray Liquid from tray
lbs/hr =47,700 GPH @ 60 =119.7
moles/hr =929.7 Hot GPH =153.0
ACFS =7.83 Hot CFS =0.339
lbs/cuft ρV=1.69 lbs/hr =33,273
Temp◦F=167 lbs/cuft ρL=27.3
Pressure PSIA =220 Temp◦F=162
Tray spacing is set at 24/prime/primeand the trays are valve type.
From Figure 18.4 ‘ K’=1,110 at ﬂood.
ρv=1.69 lbs/cuft at tray conditions.
To calculate ρof vapor at tray conditions use:
ρ=wt/hr×520×pressure (psia)
378×14.7×moles/hr ×Temp◦R
where
Press is tray pressure.
Temp◦R is tray temperature in◦F+460.

The tray dimensions and conﬁguration for design purposes are subject to a much more
rigorous examination. This is normally undertaken by the tray manufacturer from datasupplied by the purchaser’ s process engineer. However this process engineer needs tobe able to check the manufacturer’ s offer before committing to purchase. The followingcalculation procedure offers a rigorous method for this purpose which establishes traysize and geometry. This calculation is based on a method developed by Glitsch Inc.,a major manufacturer of valve and other types of trays and packing.
The rigorous method
A rigorous method used in the design of valve trays is described by the following
calculation steps:
Step 1. Establish the liquid and vapor ﬂows as described earlier for the “ quickie”
method.
Step 2. Calculate the down comer Design Velocity V
dcusing the following equations
(or by Figure 18.5).
(a)Vdc=250×system factor
(b)Vdc=41×/radicalbig
(ρL−ρv)×system factor.
(c)Vdc=7.5×√TS×/radicalbig
(ρL−ρv)×system factor
where TS =Tray spacing, in inches
Use the lowest value for the design velocity in gpm/sqft.
Down comer System Factors are given in Table 18.1.

Fluorine systems 0.9Moderate foaming (amine units) 0.85Heavy foaming (glycol, Amine) 0.73Severe foaming (MEK units) 0.6Foam stable systems (caustic regen) 0.3
Step 3. Calculate the Vapor Capacity Factor CAF using Figure 18.6.
CAF=CAFo ×system factor.
System factors used for this equation are given in Table 18.2.
Step 4. Calculate the vapor load using the equation:
Vl=CFS/radicalbig
ρv/(ρ L−ρv)
where CFS =actual vapor ﬂow in cuft/sec.
Step 5. Establish tower diameter using Figure 18.7. Tray spacing is usually 18/prime/prime,2 4/prime/prime,
or 30/prime/primefor normal towers operating at above atmospheric pressures. Large vacuum
towers may have tray spacing 30 to 36/prime/prime. Note this diameter may be increased if"
"other criteria of tray design are not met.
Step 6. Calculate the approximate Flow Path Length (FPL) based on tower diameter
from Step 5 using the equation:
FPL=9×DT/NP
where
FPL=Flow Path Length in ins.
DT=Tower Diameter from step 5 in ft
NP=Number of passes. For small towers with moderate liquid ﬂows this will
be 1. For larger towers this will depend on liquid velocities in the down comer. The
highest number of passes is usually 4.
Step 7. Calculate the minimum active area (AA m) using the expression:
AA m=Vl+(L×FPL/13,000)
CAF×FF
where
AA m=Minimum active area in sqft.
V1=Vapor load in CFS.
L=Liquid ﬂow in actual gpm.888 CHAPTER 18

FPL=Flow path length in ins.
CAF=Capacity Factor from Step 3.

Packed towers and packed tower sizing
Although trayed towers are generally the ﬁrst choice for fractionation and absorption"
"applications, there a number of instances where packed towers are preferable. Forexample on small diameter towers (below 3ft diameter) packed towers are generallycheaper and more practical for maintenance, fabrication, and installation. At theother end of the spectrum packing in the form of grids and large stacked packedbeds have superceded trays in vacuum distillation towers whose diameter range up to30 ft in some cases. This is because packing offers a much lower pressure drop thantrays.
The packing in the tower itself may be stacked in beds on a random basis or in a
deﬁned structured basis. For towers up to 10–15 ft the packing is usually dumped orrandom packed. Above this tower size and depending on its application the packingPROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 899
may be installed on a deﬁned stacked or structured manner. For practical reasons and
to avoid crushing the packing at the bottom of the bed the packing is installed in beds.As a rule of thumb packed beds should be around 15 ft in height. About 20 ft shouldbe a maximum for most packed sections.
Properties of good packing are as follows:
rShould have high surface area per unit volume
rThe shape of the packing should be such as to give a high percentage of area in
active contact with the liquid and the gas or in the two liquid phases in the case ofextractors
rThe packing should have favorable liquid distribution qualities
rShould have low weight but high unit strength
rShould have low pressure drop, but high coefﬁcients of mass transfer
Some data on the various common packing available commercially are given in Tables18.5–18.7. Figure 18.9 shows a sectional layout of a typical packed tower. Note thistower has bed supports designed for gas distribution and includes intermediate weirliquid distributors between some of the beds.
Other salient points concerning packed towers are as follows:
1.0 Reﬂux ratios, ﬂow quantities, and number of theoretical trays or transfer units are
calculated in the same manner as for trayed columns.
2.0 Internal liquid distributors are required in packed towers to ensure good distribu-
tion of the liquid over the beds throughout the tower.
3.0 The packed beds are supported by grids. These are specially designed to ensure
good ﬂows of the liquid and the gas phases.
4.0 Every care must be taken in the design of the packed tower that the packing is al-
ways properly “ wetted” by the liquid phase. Packing manufacturers usually quote
a minimum wetting rate for their packing. This is usually around 2.0–2.5 gpmof liquid per sqft of tower cross section. Most companies prefer this minimum tobe around 3.0–3.5 gpm/sqft (Tables 18.5 and 18.6).
Sizing a packed towerThe height of the tower is determined by the methods used to calculate the number oftheoretical trays required to perform a speciﬁc separation. These have been discussedearlier in Chapter 1. A ﬁgure equivalent to the height of a theoretical tray is then calcu-lated to determine the height of packing required. This is used as the basis to determinethe overall height of the tower by adding in the space required for distributors, supporttrays and the like.Table 18.5.

The diameter of the tower is calculated using a method which allows for good
mass and heat transfer while minimizing entrainment. The same principle of towerﬂooding is applicable to packed towers as for trayed towers. A calculation proce-dure for determining a packed tower diameter and the height of packed beds nowfollows:
Step 1. From examination of the ﬂows of vapor and liquid in the tower determine
the critical section of the tower where the loads are greatest. Usually this is at the
bottom of an absorption unit and either the top or bottom of a fractionator.
Step 2. Determine the conditions of temperature and pressure at the critical tower
section. This is usually accomplished by bubble and dew point calculations asdescribed in Chapter 1. That is bubble point of the bottoms liquid (either in afractionator or an absorber) determines the bottom of the tower conditions anddew point calculation of the overhead vapor determines the tower top condit-ions.
Step 3. Establish the liquid and vapor stream compositions at the critical tray con-
ditions. See Chapter 3 for determining vapor/liquid streams in absorption andfractionation towers. Calculate the properties of these streams such as densi-ties, mass/unit time, moles/unit time, viscosity, etc at the conditions of the crit-ical tower section. Next select a packing type and size. Use Table 18.7 forthis.

Step 4. Commence the tower sizing by calculating the diameter. First calculate a value
for
(L/G)/radicalbig
(ρv/ρ1)
where
L=mass liquid load in lbs/sec sqft
G=mass vapor load in lbs/sec sqft
ρv=density of vapor in lbs/cuft @ tower conditions
ρ1=density of liquid in lbs/cuft @ tower conditions
Then using Figure 18.10 read off a value for the equation:
/bracketleftbiggLρv
Gρl/bracketrightbigg1/2
=V2·S·ρv·µ0.2
g(F)3ρ1904 CHAPTER 18
where
V=the vapor velocity at ﬂood in ft/sec
g=32.2 ft/sec/sec
S=Surface area of packing in sqft/cuft of packing. (see Table 18.5)
F=Fraction of void (see Table 18.5)
µ=Viscosity of liquid in cps.
Step 5. Solve the equation from step 4 to give a value for V. This is the superﬁcial
velocity of the vapor at ﬂood. Designing for 80% of ﬂood multiply Vby 0.8.
Step 6. Divide the total cuft/sec of the vapor ﬂowing in the tower by 0.8V to give the
tower cross-sectional area in sqft. Calculate the tower diameter from this area.
Step 7. The next part of the calculation is to determine the height of the tower. The
number of theoretical trays has been determined by either the fractionation or
absorption calculation described in Chapter 3. It is now required to establish eitherthe actual number of trays for a trayed tower or the height of packing in the case ofa packed tower. This calculation deals with the second of these.
The next step sets out to establish the HETP which is the height equivalent to atheoretical tray.
Step 8. The HETP is calculated from the following equation:
HETP =K
1·GK2
h·DK3·62.4×α×µ2
ρ1
where
K1,2,3=factors from Table 18.6
D=tower diameter in ins
α=relative volatility of the more volatile component in the liquid phase
(see step 9 below)
µ=viscosity in cps
Gh=mass velocity of the vapor in lbs/hr sqft
Step 9. To determine the relative volatility α, select a key light component that is in
the lean liquid and the wet gas. The relative volatility is the equilibrium constantof the lightest signiﬁcant component in the rich liquid divided by the equilibriumconstant of the light key component. Solve for a value of HETP and multiply thisby the number of theoretical stages to give the total packed height.
Step 10. Determine the number of beds to accommodate the packed height. Allow
space between the beds for vapor/liquid redistribution and holdup plates. Use Fig-ure 18.9 as a guide for this. The tower height will be the sum of beds, internaldistributors packing support trays, liquid hold up and vapor disengaging space.
An example calculation now follows.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 905

Drums and drum design
Drums may be horizontal vessels or vertical. Generally drums do not contain complex
internals such as fractionating trays or packing as in the case of towers. They are usedhowever for removing material from a bulk material stream and often use simplebafﬂe plates or wire mesh to maximize efﬁciency in achieving this. Drums are usedin a process principally for:
rRemoving liquid droplets from a gas stream (knockout pot) or separating vapor andliquid streams
rSeparating a light from a heavy liquid stream (separators)
rSurge drums to provide suitable liquid hold up time within a process
rTo reduce pulsation in the case of reciprocating compressors
Drums are also used as small intermediate storage vessels in a process.
V apor disengaging drums
One of the most common examples of the use of a drum for the disengaging of vaporfrom a liquid stream is the steam drum of a boiler or a waste heat steam generator.Here the water is circulated through a heater where it is risen to its boiling pointtemperature and then routed to a disengaging drum. Steam is ﬂashed off in this drumto be separated from the liquid by its superﬁcial velocity across the area above thewater level in the drum. The steam is then routed to a super-heater and thus to the steammain. The performance of the steam super-heater depends on receiving fairly “ dry”saturated steam. That is steam containing little or no water droplets. The separationmechanism of the steam drum is therefore critical. The design of a vapor disengagingdrum depends on the velocity of the vapor and the area of disengagement. This isexpressed by the equation:
V
c=0.157/radicalbiggρ1−ρv
ρv
where
Vc=critical velocity of vapor in ft/sec
ρ1=density of liquid phase in lbs/cuft
ρv=density of vapor phase in lbs/cuft.
The area used for calculating the linear velocity of the vapor is:
rThe vertical cross-sectional area above the high liquid level in a horizontal drum
rThe horizontal area of the drum in the case of vertical drums"
"The allowable vapor velocity may exceed the critical, and normally design velocitieswill vary between 80% and 170% of critical. Severe entrainment occurs howeverabove 250% of critical. Table 18.8 gives the recommended design velocities for thevarious services. The minimum vapor space above the liquid level in a horizontaldrum should not be less than 20% of drum diameter or 12
/prime/prime, whichever is greater.Table 18.8. Some typical drum applications

Crinkled wire mesh screens (CWMS) screens are effective entrainment separators and
are often used in separator drums for that purpose. When installed they improve the
separation efﬁciency so vapor velocities much above critical can be tolerated. Theyare also a safeguard in processes where even moderate liquid entrainment cannot betolerated.
CWMS are now readily available as packages that include support plates and instal-
lation ﬁxtures. Normally for drums larger than 3 ft in diameter 6

Heavier than 0.850 Water 0.005 ins.
The holdup time required for settling is the vertical distance in the drum allocated
to settling divided by the settling rate. Some typical applications of drums for thisservice are given in Table 18.8.
Settling bafﬂes, are often used to reduce the holdup time and the height of the liquid
level.
Surge drums
This type of drum, the calculation of holdup time and surge control has been describedfully in Chapter 4.0 under “ Control Systems” .
Pulsation drums or pots
This type of drum will be described in some detail in Part 3 of this chapter in thesection on reciprocating compressors.
An example calculation on drum sizing now follows.
Example calculation
It is required to provide the dimensions and process data for the design of a reﬂuxdrum receiving the hydrocarbon distillate, water, and uncondensed hydrocarbon vaporfrom a distillation column. Details of ﬂow and drum conditions are as follows:
Vapor: 12,000 lbs/hr, 40 mole wt, 300 moles/hr.
Distillate product: 76,650 lbs/hr, Sg @ 100
◦F 0.682.
Reﬂux liquid: 61,318 lbs/hr, Sg @ 100◦F , 0.682.
Water: 17,381.Temperature of drum: 100
◦F
Pressure of drum: 30 psia.
The drum is to be a horizontal vessel located on a structure 45 ft above grade. The
liquid product is to feed another fractionating unit and therefore requires a holdup timeof 15 min between LLL and HLL. The vapor leaving the drum is to be routed to fuelgas via a compressor, therefore complete disengaging of liquid droplets is required.Complete separation of water from the oil is required. However as the water is routedto a de-salter separator from the drum separation of oil from the water is not critical.
In all probability the surge volume required by the product will be the determin-
ing feature of this design. Setting the liquid levels in the drum will depend on the912 CHAPTER 18
settling out of the water from the hydrocarbon phase. The design will be checked for
satisfactory vapor disengaging.

for all vessels. These data include:

rThe type of material to be used in its fabrication
rThe design and operating conditions of temperature and pressure
rThe need for insulation for process reasons

The vessel sketch
This particular vessel is a light ends fractionator and has a single tray diameter (i.e.,
it is not swaged). The tower contains 36 valve trays on a 24/prime/primetray spacing and has a"
"calculated diameter of 39/prime/primefor the trayed section. This diameter will be speciﬁed as
41/prime/primei/d however. This can be met by a standard 42/prime/primeschedule “ X” pipe and this will
reduce the cost of the vessel. The overall dimension for the tower is completed bysetting the height of the tower from Tan to Tan. In the example here this has beendone as follows:
Height of trayed section =(No of trays −1.0)×tray spacing.
The fractionation calculation (see Chapter 3.2 for this type of calculation) has deter-mined 36 actual trays for this tower. Thus the trayed height is (36 −1)×24
/prime/prime=70 ft.
Add another 3 ft to accommodate the feed inlet distributor on tray 20. Then totaltrayed height is 73 ft.
Bottom of the tower must accommodate the liquid surge requirement. As the tower
diameter is relatively small a swaged section of 4 ft diameter will be consideredbelow the bottom tray for surge. The liquid product goes to storage, therefore thesurge requirement need not be more than 3 min on product.
From the unit’ s material balance the bottom product is as follows:
Weight per hour =117,513 lbs
Temperature =440
◦F
Density @ 440◦F=40 lbs/cuft
Then hot cuft/min of product =48.96.
The product goes to storage, therefore only 2–3 min surge is required. This will be
set at 3 min surge to NLL.
Total surge to NLL =48.96×3=146.9 cuft.

Allow another 3 ft between reboiler inlet nozzle to bottom tray. This provides adequate
space for vapor separation from the high liquid level.
At the top of the column space must be provided between the top tray and the top vapor
outlet nozzle to accommodate the reﬂux return distributor and vapor disengaging fromthe top tray. Let this be 8 ft from top tray to the tower top Tan line. Then
Total tower height:

from the bottom of the tower is to be pumped (as is usual), the skirt height must be
such as to accommodate the suction conditions for the pump. The most importantof these conditions is the head required to meet the pump’ s net positive suction head(NPSH). See Part 2 of this chapter “ PUMPS”for details. Usually a skirt height of15 ft meets most NPSH requirements. The second consideration dictating skirt heightis the head required by a thermosyphon reboiler. If the vessel is new and being designedthe skirt height of 15 ft remains adequate with properly designed piping to and fromthe reboiler.
Design conditions
This particular tower operates at 212 psig and 440
◦F in the bottom and 205 psig &
158◦F at the top. It is therefore classed as a pressure vessel and will be fabricated to
meet a pressure vessel code. The most common of these codes is the ASME code
either Section 1 or Section 8. Most vessels in the chemical industry are fabricatedto ASME Section 8.When fabricated, inspected, and approved it will be stamped tocertify that its construction conforms to this pressure vessel code.
Among the data required by the code and for complete vessel engineering and fabri-
cation are the design conditions of temperature and pressure for the vessel.
Design pressure
The design pressure is based on the maximum operating pressure at which the reliefvalve will open plus a suitable safety increment. The following table provides a guideto this increment:
Maximum:
Operating pressure, psig Design pressure, psig

101–250 Operating +25
251–500 Operating +10%
501–1,000 Operating +50
over 1,000 Operating +5%
In cases where vessels relieve to a ﬂare header it may be necessary to add a little more
to the differential between operating and design pressures to accommodate for theﬂare back pressure.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 921

A vacuum condition can exist in a tower during normal steam out if the tower is
accidentally shut in and the steam valve closed. Normally a design vacuum pressureof 7 psia is speciﬁed at the steam saturated temperature to cover this contingency.
Low temperature
This applies to towers in cryogenic services (such as de methanizers, and LNG plants).There may be a situation in a non cryogenic service where rapid de-pressurizing causessub zero temperatures to exist. If this is a situation that can exist for several hours andoccurs frequently this condition should be entered. Otherwise make an appropriateremark in “ Notes and Special Conditions” .
Max liquid level
This is the liquid level under operating conditions that will:
Either— Activate the high liquid level alarm.
Or— Shut down the feed pump.
whichever system is applicable to protect the plant operation. Usually this is quoted
as the HLL and 1–2% of surge.
SG of liquid
Quote this as the SG of the liquid on which the surge volume was based. This SG isusually quoted at 60
◦F.922 CHAPTER 18
Operating conditions
In most fractionation towers there will be two distinctly different conditions of temper-ature and pressure— those for the tower top and those for the bottom of the tower. Boththese conditions must be quoted in this case. The same situation may not necessarilyarise in an absorption column.
Operating temperatures and pressures
Quote the calculated data as they will appear also on the process ﬂow diagram. Showthe tower top pressure and temperature ﬁrst, followed by the bottom set of conditions.If the tower has been sized on data for more than one design case, show the highestnumbers calculated for top and bottom. Also make a note in the “ notes and SpecialConditions” section of the cases the data was based on.
Other operating data
Vacuum conditions in this case only apply if the tower operates normally at sub at-mospheric pressure. In this case quote the lowest pressure the tower will be operatedon together with the normal operating temperature(s). Note in many vacuum frac-tionators there will be a spectrum of these conditions along the tower, these shouldbe quoted for critical locations in the tower. Such locations would be feed inlet (ﬂashzone), side stream and pump-around, draw off, tower top.
Low temperatures and the associated pressure apply only to cryogenic plants in this
case.
Hydrogen partial pressure
This item is important to the metallurgist who will select the grade of metal tobe used in the fabrication of the vessel. Generally the hydrogen partial pressurethat will be quoted will be the one that exists at the tower top under normal oper-ating conditions. For example the dew point calculation used in the sizing of thetower given in Figure 18.11 was based on the following tower top vapor composit-ion.

Materials and corrosion allowance
The process engineer will state the type of materials required to meet the processcondition. For example where carbon steel only is to be used the process engineerindicates “ CS” . He is not normally required to state the grade of steel to be used, thisis the responsibility of the vessel specialist or the metallurgist. However if the processengineer has a special knowledge of the material to be used and its speciﬁcs he shouldnote it on the data sheet.
The same applies to the corrosion allowance. Normally 1/8
/prime/primeis used for this allowance,
however there maybe some mild corrosive condition existing which may justify using
a higher number.
Description of internals"
"This is self explanatory when it refers to packed columns. In the case of trayed towersa separate data sheet giving sufﬁcient data for tray rating and sizing is attached to theprocess data sheet front page. This is shown in the attachments to Figure 18.11.
Other common internals, such as distributors, vortex breakers, and the like are not
normally shown on this data sheet. These are normally standard to a particular designofﬁce and will be added to the engineering drawings developed from this process datasheet later.
Insulation and ﬁreprooﬁng
The insulation requirement for heat conservation is speciﬁed by the process engineeras required. An approx thickness is shown. This will be checked later by the vesselspecialist. In the case of ﬁreprooﬁng the process engineer indicates whether or not itis needed. The process engineer’ s relief valve sizing based on a ﬁre condition takesinto consideration the inclusion or not of ﬁreprooﬁng.
Notes and special conditions
This item is a “ catch all” and is used to make note of whatever other information theprocess engineer may wish to add to the data sheet to ensure the equipment item willmeet the process requirements. The question of stress relieving of the vessel is anitem which is most important to the proper fabrication of the vessel and to its cost.The process engineer usually has knowledge whether this is needed or not to handlethe process material at the conditions speciﬁed. He must therefore indicate this in this924 CHAPTER 18
section of the data sheet. Other entries in this item should be a list of the attachments
to the data sheet.
Most of the process data used to deﬁne the requirements for a horizontal drum are the
same as those applied to a column, and these have already been discussed for Figure18.11. The data included in the example given in Figure 18.12 have been calculatedearlier in this chapter. In the data sheet however a “ boot” measuring 2 ft i/d ×3f t
high has been added to the outlet end of the vessel to accumulate the water phase forbetter control of its level and to allow the disengaging of the hydrocarbon from thewater.
18.2 Pumps
Pumps in the petroleum and other process industries are divided into two general
classiﬁcations which are
rVariable head-capacity
rPositive displacement
The variable head-capacity types include centrifugal and turbine pumps whilst thepositive displacement types cover reciprocating and rotary pumps.
The centrifugal pump
Centrifugal pumps comprise a very wide class of pumps in which pumping of liquids
or generation of pressure is effected by a rotary motion of one or several impellers.The impeller or impellers force the liquid into a rotary motion by impelling action,and the pump casing directs the liquid to the impeller at low pressure and leads itaway under a higher pressure. There are no valves in centrifugal type pumps (except,of course, isolation valves for maintenance, etc.), ﬂow is uniform and devoid ofpulsation. Since this type of pump operates by converting velocity head to static head,a pump impeller operating at a ﬁxed speed will develop the same theoretical head infeet of ﬂuid ﬂowing regardless of the density of the ﬂuid. A wide range of heads canbe handled. The maximum head (in ft of ﬂuid) that a centrifugal pump can developis determined primarily by the pump speed (rpm), impeller diameter and numberof impellers in series. Reﬁnements in impeller design and the impeller blade angleprimarily effect the slope and shape of the head-capacity curve and have a minoreffect on the developed head. Multistage pumps are available which will developvery high heads; up to 5,000 ft. and up to 120 gpm. This versatility in handling highpressure head makes the centrifugal pump the most commonly used type in the processindustry.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 925
The turbine pump
Turbine pumps are a type of centrifugal pumps designed to recover power in systems
of high ﬂow and high differential pressure. These pumps transmit some of the kineticenergy in the ﬂuid into brake horsepower. The actual energy recovery is about 50% ofthe hydraulic horsepower available. This type of pump is expensive and is thereforenot as widely used as the centrifugal pump.
The rotary pumpsRotary pumps are positive displacement pumps. Unlike the centrifugal type pump
these types do not throw the pumping ﬂuid against the casing but push the ﬂuidforward in a positive manner similar to the action of a piston. These pumps howeverdo produce a fairly smooth discharge ﬂow unlike that associated with a reciprocatingpump. The types of rotary pumps commonly used in a process plant are:
The gear pump. This pump consists of two or more gears enclosed in a closely ﬁtted
casing. The arrangement is such that when the gear teeth are rotated they are unmeshed"
"on one side of the casing. This allows the ﬂuid to enter the void between gear andcasing. The ﬂuid is then carried around to the discharge side by the gear teeth, whichthen push the ﬂuid into the discharge outlet as the teeth again mesh.
Screw pumps. These have from one to three suitably threaded screwed rotors of various
designs in a ﬁxed casing. As the rotors turn, liquid ﬁlls the space between the screw
threads and is displaced axially as the threads mesh.
Lobular pumps. The Lobular pump consists of two or more rotors cut with two,
three, or more lobes on each rotor. The rotors are synchronized for positive rotation
by external gears. The action of these pumps is similar to that of gear pumps, but theﬂow is usually more pulsating than that from the gear pumps.
V ane pumps. There are two types of vane pumps: those that have swinging vanes
and those that have sliding vanes. The swinging vane type consists of a series of
hinged vanes which swing out as the rotor turns. This action traps the pumped ﬂuidand forces it into the pump discharge. The sliding vane pump employs vanes that areheld against the casing by the centrifugal force of the pumped ﬂuid as the rotor turns.Liquid trapped between two vanes is carried around the casing from the inlet andforced out of the discharge.
Reciprocating pumpsThese are positive displacement pumps and use a piston within a ﬁxed cylinder to
pump a constant volume of ﬂuid for each stroke of the piston. The discharge from926 CHAPTER 18
reciprocating pumps is pulsating. Reciprocating pumps fall into two general cate-
gories. These are the simplex type and the duplex type. In the case of the simplexpump there is only one cylinder which draws in the ﬂuid to be pumped on the backstroke and discharges it on the forward stroke. External valves open and close toenable the pumping action to proceed in the manner described. The duplex pump hasa similar pumping action to the simplex pump. In this case however there are twoparallel cylinders which operate on alternate stroke to one another. That is, when theﬁrst cylinder is on the suction stroke the second is on the discharge stroke.
Reciprocating pumps may have direct acting drives or may be driven through a
crankcase and gear box. In the case of the direct acting drive the pump piston is con-nected to a steam drive piston by a common piston rod. The pump piston therefore isactuated by the steam piston directly. Reciprocating pumps driven by electric motors,turbines, etc are connected to the prime mover through a gearbox and crankcase.
Other positive displacement pumpsThere are other positive displacement pumps commonly used in the process industry
for special services. Some of these are:
Metering or proportioning pumps. These are small reciprocating plunger type pumps
with an adjustable stroke. These are used to inject ﬁxed amount of ﬂuids into a larger
stream or vessel.
Diaphragm pumps. These pumps are used for handling thick pulps, sludge, acid or
alkaline solutions, and ﬂuids containing gritty solid suspensions. They are partic-
ularly suited to these kind of service because the working parts are associated withmoving the diaphragm back and forth to cause the pumping action. The working partstherefore do not come into contact with this type of ﬂuid which would be harmful tothem.
Characteristic curvesPump action and the performance of a pump are deﬁned in terms of their Charac-
teristic Curves. These curves correlate the capacity of the pump in unit volume per
unit time versus discharge or differential pressures. Typical curves are shown in Fig-ures 18.13–15. Figure 18.13 is a characteristic curve for a reciprocating simplex pumpwhich is direct driven. Included also is this reciprocating pump on a power drive.
Figure 18.14 gives typical curves for a rotary pump. Here the capacity of the pump
is plotted against discharge pressure for two levels of pump speed. The curves alsoshow the plot of brake horsepower versus discharge pressure for the two pump speedlevels.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 927

Figure 18.14. Characteristic curves for a rotary pump.928 CHAPTER 18
Figure 18.15. Characteristic curves for a centrifugal type pump.
Figure 18.15 is a typical characteristic curve for a centrifugal pump. This curve usually
shows four pump relationships in four plots. These are:
rA plot of capacity versus differential head. The differential head is the differencein pressure between the suction and discharge
rThe pump efﬁciency as a percentage versus capacity
rThe brake horsepower of the pump versus capacity
rThe net positive head (NPSH) required by the pump versus Capacity. The requiredNPSH for the pump is a characteristic determined by the manufacturer
Pump selection
Most industrial pumping applications favor the use of centrifugal pumps. The promi-"
"nence of this type of pump stems from its ability to handle a very wide spectrum ofﬂuids at a large range of pumping conditions. It is ﬁtting that in considering pumpselection the ﬁrst choice has to be the centrifugal pump and all others become a se-lection by exception. Centrifugal pumps are generally the simplest in construction,lowest initial cost and simplest to operate and to maintain. This item therefore beginswith the selection characteristics of the centrifugal type pump.
The centrifugal pump
Before looking at the selection of the centrifugal pump it is necessary to deﬁne the
following terminology associated with pumps in general. These are:PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 929
rCapacity
rDifferential Head
rAvailable NPSH
rRequired NPSH
Capacity. This can be deﬁned as the amount of ﬂuid the pump can handle per unit
time and at a differential pressure or head. This is usually expressed as gallons per
minute at a differential head of so many pounds per square inch or so many feet.
Differential head. This is the difference in pressure between the suction of the pump
and the discharge. It is usually expressed as PSI and FEET in specifying a pump. The
following formula is the conversion from PSI to Feet:
/Delta1H=2.31×/Delta1P
SG
where
H=the differential head in feet of ﬂuid being pumped.
P=the differential pressure of the ﬂuid across the pump measured in poundsper square inch.
SG=the speciﬁc gravity of the ﬂuid at the pumping temperature.
Available NPSH. The available NPSH is the static head available (in feet or meters)
above the vapor pressure of the ﬂuid at the pumping temperature. This is a feature ofthe design of the system which includes the pump.
Required NPSH. Is the static head above the vapor pressure of the ﬂuid required by
the pump design to function properly. The required NPSH must always be less than
the available NPSH.
Selection characteristics
Selection of any pump must depend on its ability to handle a particular ﬂuid effectively,
and the efﬁciency of the pump under normal operating conditions. The second of theseprimary requirements can be determined by the pump’ s characteristic curves. Thesehave already been described earlier in this part of the chapter, and a further discussionon these now follows:
Capacity range
Normal
Figures 18.16 and 18.17 show the normal capacity range for various types of cen-trifugal pumps in two different speed ranges, 3,550 rpm, 2,950 rpm.930 CHAPTER 18
Figure 18.16. Centrifugal pumps at 3,550 rpm.
These values correspond to motor full load speeds available with current at 60 and
50 cycles, respectively. Most process applications call for these speed ranges. Lowerspeeds are for low or medium head and high capacity requirements, and for spe-cial abrasive slurries or corrosive liquids. Low capacity centrifugal pump applica-tions may require special recirculation provisions in the process design to maintaina minimum ﬂow through the pump. Because of practical consideration in impellerconstruction, the smallest available process type centrifugal pumps are rated at about50 gpm.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 931
Figure 18.17. Centrifugal pumps at 2,950 rpm.
High and low capacity ranges
Pumps above the limits shown in Figure 18.16 and 18.17 will normally require largehorsepower drivers. Special investigation of efﬁciency, speed, NPSH requirements,etc., will normally be justiﬁed. As an example, heads at or above the limits shownfor multistage pumps at standard motor speed may be obtained by speed increasinggears (motor drive) or turbines to give pump operating speeds above maximum motorspeeds, (NPSH requirements increase with speed).
In general, centrifugal pumps should not be operated continuously at ﬂows less than
approximately 20% of the normal rating of the pump. The normal rating for thepump is the capacity corresponding to the maximum efﬁciency point. The following932 CHAPTER 18
table lists minimum desirable ﬂow rates which should be maintained by continuous
recirculation, if the required process ﬂow conditions are of lower magnitude:
Minimum

Care must be exercised in the design of any recirculation system to insure that the re-
circulated ﬂow does not increase the temperature of pump suction and cause increasedvapor pressure and reduction of available NPSH.
For low head pumps that can operate at 1,750 or 1,450 rpm, the above normal and
minimum continuous capacities are reduced by 50%.
Effect of liquid viscosity
When suitably designed, centrifugal pumps can satisfactorily handle liquids contain-"
"ing solids, dirt, grit and corrosive compounds. Though ﬂuids with viscosities up to20,000 SSU (440 centistokes) can be handled, 3,000 SSU (650 centistokes) is usuallythe practical limitation from an economical operating standpoint.
Effect of suction head
An important requirement is that there be sufﬁcient NPSH at the eye of the ﬁrst stage
impeller. This is static pressure above the vapor pressure of the ﬂuid handled to preventvaporization at the impeller eye. Flashing of the ﬂuid produces a shock or cavitationeffect at the impeller which results in metal loss, noise, lowered capacity and dischargepressure, and rapid damage to the pump. NPSH requirements for various centrifugalpumps will normally vary from 6 to over 20 (in feet of ﬂuid) depending on type, sizePROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 933
and speed. Vertical pumps can be built for practically no NPSH at all at the nozzle.
These will have extended barrels in order to provide the required NPSH at the eye ofthe ﬁrst stage impeller.
Efﬁciency
The efﬁciency of centrifugal pumps varies from about 20% for low capacity ( <20
gpm) pumps to a range of 70–80% for high capacity >500 gpm pumps. Extremely
large capacity pumps (several thousand gpm) may have efﬁciencies up to nearly
90%.
The rotary pumps
Rotary pumps deliver constant capacity against variable discharge pressure. This is a
feature for all positive displacement pumps. Rotary pumps are available for processapplication over a range of 1 to 5,000 gpm capacity and a differential pressure upto about 700 psi. Displacement of the pump varies directly as the speed except inthe case where the capacity may be inﬂuenced by a the viscosity of the ﬂuid. Inthis case thick viscous liquids may limit capacity because they cannot ﬂow into thecylinder fast enough to keep it completely ﬁlled. Rotary pumps are used mostlyin low capacity service where the efﬁciency of a centrifugal pump would be verylow.
Reciprocating pumps
The liquid discharge from reciprocating pumps is pulsating. The degree of pulsation
is higher for SIMPLEX pumps than for the DUPLEX type. The pulsation is alsohigher for direct driven pumps than for those driven by motor or turbine through agear box.
Pulsation is generally not a problem in the case of small low speed pumps of this
type. It affects only the associated instrumentation which can be compensated forby local dampeners. However as the pump speed is increased the pulsation effectbecomes more serious affecting the piping design of the system. Under these condi-tions of high pulsation instantaneous piping pressures may often exceed the designpressure of the piping. The piping must then be designed to meet this higher pressurerequirement which invariably results in a higher cost. As an alternative, dischargedampeners are often considered but these too add to the cost of the pump installat-ion.
Reciprocating pumps are used mostly in situations where their low piston speeds will
withstand corrosive and abrasive conditions. They are ideal also for pumping at low934 CHAPTER 18
capacity against high differential head and where it is necessary to maintain a constant
ﬂow rate against a gradually increasing discharge pressure.
Evaluating pump performance
Many process engineers are involved with the day to day operation of process plants.
Much of their duties in this respect is concerned with maintaining plant efﬁciency,locating trouble areas and solving operational problems. This Item is directed to theseengineers and presents the calculation methods to check pump performance in termsof the pump horsepower and the available NPSH for a pump.
Brake horsepower efﬁciency
Actual running efﬁciency can be calculated from plant data. This may be compared
with a typical expected efﬁciency to evaluate the pump performance. The steps beloware followed to arrive at this efﬁciency ﬁgure.
Step 1. Obtain ﬂow rate from plant readings. Also read discharge pressure and if
available suction pressure. If this later reading is not available calculate it from
source pressure, height of liquid above pump suction and frictional loss.
Step 2. Read stream temperature and obtain Sg of stream from lab data. Calculate Sg
at ﬂow conditions.
Step 3. Calculate differential head which is discharge pressure PSIA— suction pres-
sure PSIA. Convert to differential head in feet by
/Delta1P×144
62.2×Sg (at ﬂow cond)
Step 4. Convert feed rate to pounds per hour. Then calculate hydraulic horsepower
from the expression
Head (ft) ×rate (lbs/hr)
60 (mins) ×33,000 (ft-lbs/min)
Step 5. From motor data sheet obtain pump motor running efﬁciency from plant data
read power usage in kW .
Step 6. Convert pump power to HP by dividing kW by 0.746. Multiply this by pump
efﬁciency expressed as a fraction. This is the brake horsepower.
Step 7. Divide hydraulic horsepower by brake horsepower and multiply by 100 to
give efﬁciency as a percentage.
Step 8. Check against Figure 18.16 or 18.17 to evaluate pump performance."
"That is, the calculated efﬁciency within a reasonable agreement with the expectedefﬁciency given by Figure 18.16 or 18.17. Should there be a large discrepancy thenthe appropriate mechanical or maintenance engineers should be informed.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 935
Checking available NPSH
This needs to be done if the pump is showing signs of vibration and losing suction
under normal operations.
Step 1. Obtain details of the ﬂuid being pumped (temperature, Sg, ﬂow rate, source
pressure, and vapor pressure of ﬂuid).
Step 2. Calculate the frictional pressure drop in the suction line.
Step 3. Calculate the suction pressure of the pump by taking source pressure and
adding in the static head. For this calculation take static head as being from the
bottom of the vessel (not from the liquid level).
Step 4. From the suction pressure calculated in Step 3 take out loss through friction.
Step 5. Calculate NPSH available as being net suction pressure less vapor pressure.
This is usually quoted in feet (or meters) so convert using:
PSI×144
62.2×SG
Step 6. Check against manufacturer’ s data sheet for required NPSH. If the available
NPSH is less than required the pump will continue to cavitate. Fill tank to a levelthat the vibration stops and maintain it at that level.
If the problem is really troublesome and maintaining a liquid level as suggested instep 6 above is not practical contact the pump manufacturer. Very often he is able tomake some minor changes to the pump design that will solve the problem.
Example calculation
Example calculation No. 1—Pump brake HP efﬁciency.
Flow capacity of pump at ﬂow conditions =200 gpm
(from plant data) =82,632 lbs/hr
Suction pressure (plant data) =120 psig
Discharge pressure =450 psig
/Delta1Pressure =330 psi
Sg at ﬂow conditions =0.827
Differential head ft =330×144
62.2×0.827=924 ft
Hydraulic horsepower =82,632×924
60×33,000
=38.56
From motor rating, motor efﬁciency is 92%
Plant readings show motor power usage =48.1 kW936 CHAPTER 18
Then motor HP input =48.1
0.746=64.5 HP
Motor output =64.5×0.92
=59.3
This is brake HP
Then pump efﬁciency =38.56×100
59.3=65%
Motor is 50 cycle speed. From Figure 4.5 for multistage 2,950 rpm. This efﬁciency
ﬁgure is about right.
Example calculation No. 2—Checking available NPSH
Fluid is gas oil from surge drum at 250◦F and 15 psig drum is 12 ft above grade
(bottom of drum which is horizontal).
Boiling point at 34 psia is 488◦F.
Vapor pressure of gas oil at 250◦F=0.8 psia (VP curves)
Source pressure =29.7 psia
Sg @ conditions =0.815
Head above grade =12 ft (to bottom of drum)
Pump center line =2 ft above grade
Liquid head to pump =10 ft = 3.5 psi
Friction pressure drop =0.4 psi (calculated from 0.2 psi/100)
Less friction =0.4
Less vapor press =0.8
Available NPSH =33.2−(0.4+0.8)=32 psia
=91 ft
Most pumps only require 10 ft or less.
Specifying a centrifugal pump
In all engineering companies and in most petroleum reﬁneries two disciplines are
responsible for correctly specifying a pump. These are the Mechanical Engineer andthe Process Engineer. Most pumps are designed and built in accordance with set andaccepted industrial codes, such as the API codes. The mechanical engineer ensuresthat the mechanical data supplied to the manufacturer for a particular pump meetsthe requirements of the code and standards to which the pump is to be built. ThePROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 937
process engineer develops and speciﬁes precisely the performance required of the
pump in meeting the process criteria of the plant. To accomplish this the mechanicalengineer develops a mechanical speciﬁcation, and the process engineer initiates thepump speciﬁcation sheet.
The mechanical speciﬁcation
This speciﬁcation is in a narrative form and will contain at least the following topics:
rScope— Introductory paragraph which gives the code the pump manufacturer is to
conform to (such as API 610).A list of other standards the pump shall conform to, if these are required.
rMain Body of the Speciﬁcation— This covers all additions and any exceptions tothe selected code. It provides for the type of drive shaft acceptable if different tocode. Items such as impeller size as a percent of maximum allowable by code isgiven. The need for special bearing arrangements in the case of multi stage pumpsare detailed in this document.
rAncillary equipment and piping arrangements— The speciﬁcation describes in de-tail the type of cooling medium that shall be used. It provides a guide also to thepiping requirements that is required to satisfy the cooling system(s).
rSeal or Packing requirements— The mechanical speciﬁcation details the type ofseal or packing that will be installed. It also provides details of the seal arrangementrequired if this is different to the standard code."
"rPump Mounting— Some installation guide is provided by this speciﬁcation. Themethod by which the pump is mounted on the base plate is detailed. It also detailsunder what conditions the manufacturer is to provide pedestal cooling facilities.
rMetallurgy— Although the process engineer will specify the general material ofconstruction for the pump(such as carbon steel or cast iron etc.) it is the mechanicalengineer who details this. This detail includes the speciﬁc grade of the material andin many cases its pre-operational treatment.
rInspection— The mechanical speciﬁcation will provide details of the inspectionthat the company will carry out during the manufacture of the pump and beforeits delivery. This will include dimensional checking during manufacture and somechecks on the metallurgy. Prior to shipping the purchaser may require a runningtest of the pump and will witness this test. For this purpose the pump is run in theworkshop under speciﬁed process conditions.
The mechanical speciﬁcations may continue to detail other requirements that thepurchaser may wish. Its objective is to ensure that the pump when delivered is me-chanically robust, is safe and easily maintainable. The mechanical speciﬁcation mustalso be aware of the cost implication of the requirements on the pump, and to keepthem as low as possible.938 CHAPTER 18
The process speciﬁcation
The data provided by the process engineer must be sufﬁcient to ensure that the pump
delivered for the process purpose will meet the duty required of it. These data arefurnished to the pump manufacturer in the form of a data sheet similar to the oneshown here as Figure 18.18. The data sheet collects the essential input from the processengineer, the mechanical engineer and, later, by the manufacturer to describe fullywhat is required of the pump and what the manufacturer has supplied. All the datagiven here will be unique to this pump.
The process input to the pump speciﬁcation shown on Figure 13.6 are those items
marked with the ‘ P’ . Input by other disciplines and the manufacturer are not indicatedon the form. The process engineer compiles much of these data from an ‘ HydraulicAnalysis’of the piping system. A calculation sheet given as Figure 18.19 shows thedevelopment of this and is described as follows:
Compiling the pump calculation sheet
The pump number, title, and serviceThis ﬁrst section of the calculation sheet is important because it identiﬁes the pump
and what it is intended to do. The item number and service description will be uniqueto this item and will remain as its identiﬁcation throughout its life. All the data belowthis section will refer only to this pump and to no other. The item number may containthe sufﬁx ‘ A’,‘B’,‘C’ , etc. This indicates identical pumps in parallel service or as
spare or both. This section also shows how many of these pumps are motor drivenand how many are turbine (steam) driven. Usually spare pumps in critical service willbe turbine driven. The remark column in this section should give any informationthat will be of beneﬁt to the pump manufacturer or future operators of the pump. Forexample, if the spare pump is turbine driven, the process engineer may require anautomatic start up of the turbine on a ‘ low ﬂow’of the pumped stream. This shouldbe noted here.

The details of the ﬂuid to be pumped and a summary of the calculations given below
are entered here. Starting on the left of this section:

this will simply be ‘ vacuum gas oil’ .

appendix in Chapter 3 Appendix Figure 1. First locate the vapor pressure of thestream at atmospheric pressure. (This is the material’ s normal boiling point). Followthe temperature line down or up to the PT and read off the pressure at that point.
Viscosity @ PT: This too is self explanatory. Note this calculation sheet requires the
viscosity to be in Centipoise. This is Centistokes ×SG.
US gpm @ PT: This is the pump capacity and three rates are asked for. These are:
rMinimum rate: The anticipated lowest rate the pump will operate at for any contin-
uous basis. This rate sets the control valve range.
rNormal rate: This is the rate given in the material balance and the basis for the
hydraulic analysis.
rMaximum rate: This is normally set based on the type of service that the pump will
undertake. For example: Pumps used only as rundown to storage will have a maxrate about 10% above normal. Those used for reﬂux to towers will have between15% and 20% above normal.
Discharge pressure, psig: This ﬁgure is calculated in the column below. It will also
have been determined by the hydraulic analysis of the system.
Suction pressure, psig: Two pressures are asked for in this item. Rated pressure is
that calculated in the column below and in the hydraulic analysis given in item 1. It is
based on the ‘ Norm’Rate. The ‘ Max’suction pressure is based on a source pressure
at the design pressure rating of the vessel the pump is taking suction from.
Differential pressure, psi: This is the discharge pressure minus the rated suction
pressure.
Differential head feet: The head is determined from the differential pressure by the
equation:
Diff Press (psi) ×144
62.2×S G@P T.
NPSH feet: Is calculated in the column below. This is the suction head available greater
than the ﬂuid vapor pressure (at the PT) at the pump impeller inlet.942 CHAPTER 18
Hydraulic horsepower: This is calculated from the weight per unit time (usually
minutes or seconds) of ﬂuid being pumped times the differential head in feet divided
by 550 ft-lbs/sec or 33,000 ft-lbs/min. The differential head is always based on therated suction pressure and the weight on the rated capacity (gpm) for this calcu-lation.
Corrosion/erosion: The process engineer notes any signiﬁcant characteristic of the
ﬂuid regarding its corrosiveness or abrasiveness here.
Turbine conditions
Although this item is not strictly part of a pump deﬁnition it should be included for
completeness in the case of turbine drives. The data required to complete this item isself explanatory.
Pump material
The process engineer indicates here the acceptable material for the pump in handling
the ﬂuid. For example: carbon steel, or cast iron, etc; it is not necessary to specifygrade of steel, etc.
The calculation columns
The objective of this section of the calculation sheet is to itemize all the data that
are used to provide the ﬁgures given in the operating conditions described in Section“ Operating conditions for each pump” above. The ﬁrst column lists those items whilethe other three columns are available for entering the corresponding numbers. Thesethree columns are provided to cater for alternate conditions that may need to bestudied. A space is left on the right of the form to sketch the pumping system (it isvery advisable to do a sketch).
The ﬁrst column starts with the destination pressure, and continues down with the
list of the pressure drops in the system to the pump discharge. This section ofthe column ends with the sum of the pressure drops giving the pump discharge pres-sure. The items that make up the pump suction pressure are listed next. This startswith he source pressure (usually a vessel) and its static head above the pump. All thepressure drops in the suction side are listed and deducted from the sum of the sourcepressure and static head to give the pump suction pressure.
The last section in the column itemizes the data that gives the available NPSH for the
pump. The development of the NPSH is self explanatory.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 943
Centrifugal pump seals
A pump seal is any device around the pump shaft designed to prevent the leakage of"
"liquid out of or air into a pump casing. All industrial pumps have shafts protrudingthrough the casings which require sealing devices. Pump sealing devices are usuallyeither a “ packed box” with or without a lantern ring, or a mechanical seal. Controlledleakage is a system sometimes used.
A ﬂushing stream must be introduced into the pump seals for one or more of the
following reasons:
rTo effect a complete seal
rTo provide cooling, washing or lubrication to the seal
rTo keep grit from the seal
rTo prevent corrosive liquid from reaching the seal
The facilities for accomplishing this are called “ ﬂushing system” , and there are twotypes of these in general use.
rA dead-end system
rA through system
I na“dead-end” system the ﬂushing liquid enters the casing through the stufﬁng box
and combines with the pumped ﬂuid (see Figure 18.20a). A “ through” system is onein which the ﬂushing liquid is re circulated between a double seal arrangement anddoes not enter the pump (see Figure 18.20b). The liquid source may be external to thepump or as on most mechanical seals is a self-ﬂushing system in which the pumpedliquid is used as the ﬂushing ﬂuid.
A description of each of the types of sealing devices is presented below and illustrated
in Figure 18.21.
Packed boxes (without lantern ring) Figure 18.21a.
This is the simplest type of pump seal. Its principal components are a stufﬁng box,
rings of packing, a throat bushing, and a packing gland. A slight leakage through thepacking is required at all times to lubricate the packing. A water quench is used at thepacking gland if the packing “ leakage” is considered ﬂammable or toxic.
Packed box (with lantern ring) Figure 18.21b
When a packed box pump seal is used in conjunction with a ﬂushing oil system, a
lantern ring is usually provided. This metallic ring provides a ﬂow path for the ﬂushingoil to reach the pump shaft. For very erosive or corrosive services, the lantern ring is944 CHAPTER 18
Figure 18.20. Typical ﬂushing systems (a) a dead end system, (b) a through— re-circulating system.
often located next to the throat bushing and a liquid is injected into the throat bushing
to prevent the pumped ﬂuid from reaching the packing area. For a pump operationwith vacuum suction conditions, the lantern ring is installed at the middle of the boxand liquid is injected to prevent air entering the system. This type also operates withpositive leakage with the same comments as the packed box without lantern ring.
Mechanical seals Figure 18.21c and d.
Typical basic elements of a single seal are shown in Figure 18.21c. Sealing is affected
between the precision-lapped faces of the rotating seal ring and stationary seal ring.The stationary seal ring is usually carbon, and is mounted in the seal plate by an“ O” ring. The two “ O” ring packing serves the dual purpose of sealing off any liquidtending to leak behind the seal rings, and also to provide ﬂexibility in allowing theseal faces to align themselves exactly so as to compensate for any slight “ wobble” ofthe rotating seal face caused by shaft whip.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 945
Figure 18.21. Pump shaft packing and seals. (a) Stufﬁng box completely ﬁlled with packing no lantern
ring. (b) Externally sealed stufﬁng box. (c) Single Mechanical Seal. (d) Double Mechanical Seal.
The rotating seal ring is usually stainless steel with a Stellite face. The springs furnish
the necessary force to set the “ O” ring and hold the seal faces closed under low stufﬁngbox pressures. Any pressure in the box exerts additional force on the rotating sealingring. The seal is frequently “ balanced” so that the face pressure is in correct ratio tothe liquid pressure to ensure adequate sealing without excessive loading of the faces.Flushing oil enters the stufﬁng box through a connection in the seal plate.
A double seal consists of two single seals back to back. See Figure 18.21d. As a
double seal is more expensive and requires a complicated seal-oil system, it is usedonly where single seals are not practical.946 CHAPTER 18
Table 18.20 summarizes the application of the various sealing systems in the reﬁnery
operation.
Pump drivers and utilities
Most pumps in the process industry are driven either by electric motors, or by steam,
usually in the form of steam turbines. This item deals with the calculation of the driverrequirements and its speciﬁcation.
Electric motor drivers
Electric motors are by far the most common pump driver in industry. They are more
versatile and are cheaper than a comparable size of steam turbine. The electric motorsused for pump drivers are the induction type motor. They range in size from fractionalhorsepower to 500 and higher horsepower. Sizing the required motor for a pump drivertakes into consideration the pump brake horsepower, the energy losses occurring inthe coupling device between the pump and the motor, and a contingency factor ofabout 10%. These are expressed by the equation:
Minimum driver BHP =Maximum pump BHP ×1.1"
"Mechanical efﬁciency of coupling
If the pump is driven through a direct coupling the efﬁciency will be 100%. Withgears or ﬂuid coupling the efﬁciency will be between 94% and 97%.
Specifying motor driver requirements
Process engineers are called upon very often to specify pump driver requirements or
to check the already existing. In doing this two items of data need to be obtained orcalculated. These are:
rThe actual required horsepower of the pump motor to drive the pump at its speciﬁedduty
rWhat is actually installed in terms of horsepower
These data are tabulated in terms of power load as follows:
Operating load, kW— This is power input to the motor a normal operating horsepower.
Connected load, kW— This is power input to the motor at motor rated horsepower.
If the pump is spared by another motor driven pump then the connected load will be
the sum of both motors.
Operating load =Minimum required driver HP ×.746
Efﬁciency of the motor @ its operating HP
Connected load =Rated motor HP ×.746×number of motors
Efﬁciency of the motors @ 100% Full load.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 947

Example calculation
Calculate the operating and connected loads for pump 11-P-3 A&B as speciﬁed inFigure 18.19 of this chapter.
From the pump calculation sheet the hydraulic horsepower is calculated:
HHP=lbs/min ×diff head in feet

This will be a direct driven pump thus coupling efﬁciency is 100%
Minimum motor size =BHP×1.1=96.6H P
The closest motor size to this requirement is 100 HP (Table 18.21). This is a little too
close so a motor size of 125 HP will be selected.
Operating Load =Rated HP ×0.746

Connected load =125×.746
0.915
=101.9 kW say 102 kW
Note if both regular and spare pumps were motor driven then the connected loadwould be 2 ×102=204 kW .
Reacceleration requirement
To complete the speciﬁcation for the motor requirement a degree of process impor-
tance of the pump must be established and noted. V oltage drops that can occur in anysystem may be sufﬁcient to stop the pump. The process engineer must determine howimportant it is to the process and the safety of the process to be able to restart andreaccelerate the particular pump quickly. The following code of importance has beenadopted:
rRe acceleration absolutely necessary.— A
rRe acceleration desirable.— B
rRe acceleration unnecessary.— C
The ‘ A’category involves any pump critical to keeping the process on stream safelyand with no possibility of equipment damage. The ‘ B’category applies to thosepumps that in operation with the ‘ A’category will maintain the unit ‘ on spec’ .The ‘ C’category refers to those pumps that can be started manually without anyproblems.950 CHAPTER 18
In the case of the example pump 11-P-3 A&B given here, the service required of the
pump is so critical to the operation and orderly shutdown of the process in the caseof power failure that the spare pump is Turbine driven. Thus the motor driven regularpump need only be coded ‘ C’for reacceleration.
Steam turbine driversSteam turbines are the second most common pump drivers in modern day process
industry. Although more expensive than the electric motor they offer an excellentstand-by to retain the maximum process ‘ on stream’time. The one big disadvantagewith power driven pumps is the reliability of power availability. Steam turbines there-fore offer a good alternative in cases of power failure. Another alternative meansof pump drivers is the diesel engine or gas engine, but these require their own fuelstorage etc. and are certainly not as reliable as the steam turbine.
Most process plants therefore spare the critical pumps in the process with a turbine
driven unit which may be started automatically on low process ﬂow.
The principle of the turbine driver
Turbines are the most ﬂexible of prime movers in today’ s industry. Their horsepower"
"output can be varied by the number and size of the steam nozzles used, speeds can bechanged readily, and high speeds without gearing are possible. They have a very widerange of horsepower applications. The operation of the steam turbine is analogous tothat of a water wheel where buckets are attached to the wheel which collect the water.The wheel is moved downwards by the weight of the water collected and thus causethe rotation of the wheel. In steam turbines the buckets are replaced by vanes whichare impinged by the motive steam to cause the rotating motion. Turbines may consistof one set of vanes keyed to the shaft in the case of a single stage machine or severalsets of vanes in the case of multi stage machines. These sets of vanes are called simply‘ wheels’and the number of stages are referred to as the number of wheels.
In the case of multistage turbines, the steam leaving the ﬁrst wheel is directed towards
a set of stationary vanes attached to the casing. These stationary vanes reverse thesteam ﬂow and serve as nozzles directing the steam toward the second wheel attachedto the same shaft.
Most turbines used on a regular basis in a process plant are single stage. Multi stage
machines are more efﬁcient but are also much more expensive. Their use thereforeis for drivers requiring horsepower in excess of 300. The power industry is a goodexample for the use of large multi stage turbine drivers. Single or multi stage turbinesmay be operated either condensing or non condensing. However pump drivers shouldPROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 951
not be made condensing without a rigorous review to see if other types of drives can
be used. The complexity of condensing is hardly worth the small savings in utilities
that are made.
The performance of the steam turbine
The salient factors in the performance of the steam turbine are:
rHorsepower output
rSpeed
rSteam inlet and outlet conditions
rIts mechanical construction (e.g., number of wheels, size of the wheel, etc.)
These factors are interrelated and their effect on the performance of the turbine is
reﬂected by a change in over-all efﬁciency. The overall efﬁciency may be deﬁned
as the ratio of the energy output to the energy of the steam theoretically availableat constant entropy as obtained from a Mollier diagram. This over-all efﬁciency
is the product of mechanical and thermal efﬁciencies. The losses in turbines arepartly due to friction losses of the rotating shaft and partly to thermodynamic lossesand turbulence. Figure 18.22 gives the overall efﬁciencies plotted against deliveredhorsepower.
The steam required by a turbine for a given horsepower application is called its “ Water
Rate” . The actual water rate for a turbine is supplied by the manufacturer from testruns carried out on the actual machine in the workshop. Plant operators and otherengineers very often need to be able to estimate these water rates for their work. Atypical situation arises when determining the best steam balance for a plant. Suchestimates may be obtained from Figures 18.23a and b. This and the accompanyingnotes are self explanatory.
Cooling water requirements
Many pumps in process service require water cooling to various parts of the pump.
This cooling water is applied to bearings, stufﬁng boxes, glands, and pedestals. Theapplication of the cooling water is determined by the manufacturer in accordancewith his standard for the service and conditions that the pump must satisfy. Most ofthe cooling water may be recovered in a closed cooling water system. However glandcooling water is never recovered but is routed to the waste water drain. The followinglists the approximate cooling water requirements for pumps and steam turbines:

18.3 Compressors
Types of compressors and selectionCompressors are divided into four general types, these are:
rCentrifugal
rAxial
rReciprocating
rRotary
The name given to each type is descriptive of the means used to compress the gas and
comparison of the different types of compressors and typical applications is shownin Table 18.22. A brief description of each of the types now follows:
Centrifugal
This type of compressor consists of an impeller or impellers rotating at high speed
within a casing. Flow is continuous and inlet and discharge valves are not requiredas part of the compression machinery. Block valves are required for isolation duringmaintenance.
Centrifugal compressors are widely used in the petroleum, gas, and the chemical"
"industries primarily due to the large volumes of gas that frequently have to be handled.Long continuous operating periods without an overhaul make centrifugal compressorsdesirable for use for petroleum reﬁning and natural gas applications. Normally theyare considered for all services where the gas rates are continuous and above 400ACFM (actual cubic feet per minute) for a clean gas, and 500 ACFM for a dirty gas.These rates are measured at the discharge conditions of the compressor. Dirty gasesare considered to be gases similar to those from a catalytic cracker, which may containsome ﬁne particles of solid or liquid material.
The slowly rising head-capacity performance curves make centrifugal compressors
easy to control by either suction throttling or variable speed operation.
The main disadvantage of this type compressor is that it is very sensitive to gas density,
molecular weight and polytropic compression exponent. A decrease in density orPROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 955
molecular weight results in an increase in the polytropic head requirement of the
compressor to develop the required compression ratio.
Axial ﬂow
These compressors consist of bladed wheels that rotate between bladed stators.
Gas ﬂow is parallel to the axis of rotation through the compressor. Axial ﬂow com-pressors become economically more attractive than centrifugal compressors in ap-plications where the gas rates are above 70 000 ACFM at suction conditions. The
compressors are extremely small relative to capacity and have a slightly higher efﬁ-ciency than the centrifugal. Axial ﬂow compressors are widely used as air compressorsfor jet engines and gas turbines.
Reciprocating
Reciprocating compressors are widely used in the petroleum and chemical industries.
They consist of pistons moving in cylinders with inlet and exhaust valves. They arecheaper and more efﬁcient than any other type in the ﬁelds in which they are used.Their main advantages are that they are insensitive to gas characteristics and theycan handle intermittent loads efﬁciently. They are made in small capacities and areused in applications where the rates are too small for a centrifugal. Reciprocatingcompressors are used almost exclusively in services where the discharge pressuresare above 5,000 psig.
When compared with centrifugal compressors, the reciprocating compressors require
frequent shutdowns for maintenance of valves and other wearing parts. For criticalservices this requires either a spare compressor or a multiple compressor installationto maintain plant throughput. In addition, they are large and heavy relative to theircapacity.
Rotary
Recent developments in the rotary compressor ﬁeld have opened up areas of appli-
cation in the process industry with the use of the following types of rotary compressors:
(1)High pressure screw
These compressors have been developed into heavy duty type machines. Theyconsist of two rotating helices that rotate in a casing without actual contact.Rotary compressors are lower in cost and have a higher efﬁciency than centrifugalcompressors. They are not sensitive to gas characteristics since they are positivedisplacement machines. Parts are standardized production items so that a sparerotor is not generally required to be stocked for emergency replacement.956 CHAPTER 18
This compressor is noisy and sensitive to temperature rise along the screws due
to the close clearances involved. They are good for fouling services where the
fouling material forms a soft deposit. This decreases the clearances and leakagealong the screws and casing. They are not recommended for use in fouling servicesin which the deposits are hard.
Variation in speed or a discharge bypass to suction are the only types of control
that can be used.
(2)Low pressure screw, lobe and sliding vaneThese compressors should be used only for low pressure, light duty, non-criticalapplications. They operate on the same principle as the high pressure screw typebut have different mechanical designs. The same advantages and disadvantagesapply as those for rotary high pressure screw compressors. They are even lowerin cost than the high pressure screw compressors but contain parts having limitedlife, thus requiring more maintenance.
Only centrifugal and reciprocating compressors will be discussed further in
this book.
Calculating horsepower of centrifugal compressors
Centrifugal compressors are used in process service where high capacity ﬂows are
required. A typical example is the recycle compressor for handling a hydrogen richstream in some oil reﬁning and petrochemical processes. The following table givessome idea of the centrifugal compressors capacity range.

145,000–200,000 0.77 0.73 2,500
In general the head or differential pressure levels served by centrifugal compressor
is considerably lower than that for reciprocal. The following diagram illustrates thisfeature.Table 18.22. Comparison of compressors and typical applications

Process Engineers are often required to establish the capability of a centrifugal com-
pressor in a particular service or to assess the machine’ s capability to handle a differentservice. In conducting these studies it is necessary to determine the machine’ s horse-power under the study conditions. This item provides a procedure where the gashorsepower (and thereafter the brake horsepower) of a compressor can be calculated.
This procedure is as follows:
Step 1. Establish the duty required from the compressor in terms of:
rCapacity in CF/min at inlet conditions
rDesign inlet temp
rDesign inlet pressure
rThe mole wt of the gas to be handled"
"rCompression ratio (P2/P1) P2 being the discharge pressure and P1 the inlet
pressure
Step 2. Establish the ‘ K’ v alue for the gas. If this is a pure gas (such as Oxygen) the ‘ K’
value can be read from data books. Otherwise the ‘ K’v alue is the ratio CP/CV.
See Figure 18.A.3 in the Appendix. (Note: Do not confuse this ‘ K’f actor with
Equilibrium Constants.)
Step 3. Calculate volume of the gas in SCF/min. This is the inlet CFM times inlet
pressure times 520 divided by 14.7 psia times inlet temperature in
◦R, thus
SCFM =1 CFM ×inlet press ×520
14.7×inlet temp◦R
Step 4. Calculate number of moles gas/min by dividing SCF/m by 378. Multiply
number of moles by mole wt for lbs/min of gas.960 CHAPTER 18
Figure 18.24. Estimated discharge temperatures for centrifugal compressors.

Centrifugal compressor surge control, performance curves and seals
Centrifugal compressors can be counted on for uninterrupted run lengths of between
18 and 36 months after the initial shakedown run. The 18 month run corresponds to a964 CHAPTER 18
compressor handling dirty gas, such as furnace gas, and the 36 month run corresponds
to a clean gas service, such as refrigerant.
Spare compressors are not usually provided. A spare rotor, however, is required to be
stocked as insurance against an extended downtime. Since this rotor is part of the cap-ital cost of the equipment, it is not accounted for as spare parts. Only reliable driverssuch as an electric motor, steam or gas turbine can be used where long continuous runlengths are required. In the case of steam and gas turbines, the drivers will probablydictate the maximum possible run length. The high operating speed of a centrifugalcompressor also favors the selection of these type of high-speed drivers. The speed ofthese drivers can be speciﬁed to be the same as those of the compressor. For electricmotor drives, a speed increasing gear is normally required. Centrifugal compressorscan be broadly classiﬁed with regards to head and capacity as follows:
Polytropic
Speed, RPM Suction, ACFM head ft #/#
Small standard multistage 3,000–3,600 100–1,000 to 8,500
Standard single stage 3,000–3,600 700–60,000 1,000–6,700
Special single stage 3,000–15,000 1,000–60,000 6,700–11,500
Special multistage casing, uncooled 3,000–15,000 1,000–140,000 6,700–100,000
Special multistage, multi-casing, inter-cooled 3,000–15,000 2,500–140,000 37,000 up
As a guide, the maximum head per impeller is about 10,000 ft. Normally, about 8impellers can be used in a casing.
The minimum allowable volume of gas at the compressor discharge is about 400"
"ACFM for a clean gas and 500 ACFM for a dirty gas. Dirty gases are considered tobe similar to the gas from a steam or catalytic cracking unit.
The discharge temperature is limited to about 250
◦F for gases that may polymerize
and 400◦F for other gases. Normally inter-coolers will be used to keep the discharge
temperature within these limits. These temperature limitations do not apply to special
centrifugal ﬂue gas re-circulator which can be obtained to operate at over 800◦F.
There is also a temperature rise limitation of 350◦F per casing. This is the maximum
temperature rise that can be tolerated due to thermal expansion considerations.
Use of cast iron as a casing material is limited to 450◦F maximum. Temperatures of
−150◦Ft o−175◦F can be tolerated in conventional designs. Lower temperatures are
not common and will require consulting on individual design features.
Surge
A characteristic peculiar to centrifugal and axial compressors is a minimum capacity
at which the compressor operation is stable. This minimum capacity is referred to asPROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 965
the surge or pumping point. At surge, the compressor does not meet the pressure of
the system into which it is discharging. This causes a cycle of ﬂow reversal as thecompressor alternately delivers gas and the system returns it.
The surge point of a compressor is nearly independent of its speed. It depends largely
on the number of wheels or impellers in series in each stage of compression. Reason-able reductions in capacity to specify for a compressor are shown below.
Wheels/compression % of normal capacity

An automatic re-circulation bypass is required on most compressors to maintain the
minimum ﬂow rates shown. These are required during start-up or when the normalload falls below the surge point. Cooling is required in the recycle circuit if thedischarge gas is returned to the compressor suction.
Performance curves
The rise of performance curves should be speciﬁed for a compressor. This is normally
done by specifying the pressure ratio rise to surge required in each stage of compres-sion. A continuously rising curve from normal ﬂow rate to surge ﬂow is required forstable control.
The pressure ratio rise to surge is largely a function of the number of impellers per
compression stage. Reasonable pressure ratio rises to specify are shown below:

Frequently, the performance curves for a compressor have to be plotted to determine if
all anticipated process operations will ﬁt the compressor and its speciﬁc speed control.Three points on the head-capacity curve are always known. These are the normal, surgeand maximum capacity points. The normal capacity is always considered to be onthe 100% speed curve of the compressor. The surge point and the compression ratio966 CHAPTER 18
rise to surge have been speciﬁed. From this the head produced by the compressor at
the surge point can be back-calculated using the head-pressure ratio relationship. Themaximum capacity point is speciﬁed to be at least 115% capacity at 85% of normalhead.
The head-capacity curve retains its characteristic shape with changes in speed. Curves
at other speeds can be obtained from the three known points on the 100% speed curveby using the following relationships:
1. The polytropic head varies directly as the speed squared.
2. The capacity varies directly as speed.3. The efﬁciency remains constant.
Figure 18.26 shows a typical centrifugal compressor performance curve.
Control
Speed
Speed control is the most efﬁcient type of control from an energy consideration. Itrequires, however, that a variable speed driver such as a steam turbine or gas turbine,or a variable-speed electric motor be used. The compressor is controlled by shiftingits performance curve to match the systems requirement.
Suction throttling
rAdjustable inlet guide vanes. Adjustable inlet guide vanes are the most efﬁcient
method of adjusting the capacity of a constant speed compressor to match the
system characteristics. They consist of a venetian blind device that is positionedby a rack and pinion linkage. While the guide vanes do some throttling, their maineffect is to change the velocity of the gas to that of the impeller vane by changingthe direction of ﬂow. This changes the head produced and in effect changes thecharacteristic of the machine.
rSuction throttle. This control consists of a control valve located in the compressor
suction which regulates the suction pressure to the compressor. The control valveresults in a greater power loss compared to adjustable inlet guide vane control sinceit is a pure throttling effect. Suction throttle valves are lower in cost than adjustableinlet guide vanes.
rDischarge throttling. This control consists of a control valve located in the compres-"
"sor discharge. Discharge throttle valves are seldom used since they offer relativelylittle power reduction at reduced capacity. The effect is simply to “ push” the com-pressor back on its curve.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 967
Figure 18.26. An Example of a centrifugal compressor performance curve.
Seals
Table 18.23 shows the types of seals that are commonly used in centrifugal compres-
sors. The start-up as well as the operating conditions of the compressor should beconsidered in selecting a seal. Often the system is evacuated when hydrocarbons arehandled prior to its start-up. This requires that the seal be good for vacuum conditions.968 CHAPTER 18

Specifying a centrifugal compressor
The process speciﬁcation must give all the information concerning the gas that is to be
handled, its inlet and outlet conditions, the utilities that are available and the servicethat is required of the compressor. The process speciﬁcation sheet given here showsthe minimum that a process engineer should provide in approaching manufacturers.An explanation of this speciﬁcation now follows covering each of the items in thespeciﬁcation.
Title block
This requires the item to be identiﬁed by item number and its title. The number of
units that the speciﬁcation refers to is also given here. For a centrifugal compressorthis will normally be just one as very seldom is a spare machine required.
Normal and rated columns
More often than not the conditions and quantities required to be handled will vary
during the operation of the machine. The two columns therefore will be completedshowing the average normal data in the ﬁrst column and the most severe conditionsand duty required by the compressor in the second. The severe conditions in columntwo are for a continuous length of operation not instantaneous peaks (or troughs) thatmay be encountered.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 969
Gas
The composition and gas stream identiﬁcation must be included as part of the process
speciﬁcation. Usually the composition of the gas is listed on a separate sheet asshown in the example. Note in many catalytic processes that utilize a recycle gas thecomposition of the gas will change as the catalyst in the process ages. Thus it will benecessary to list the gas composition at the start of the run (SOR) and at the end ofthe run (EOR).
The compressor may also be required to handle an entirely different gas stream at
some time or other. This too must be noted. For example in many petroleum reﬁningprocesses a recycle compressor normally handling a light predominately hydrogengas is also used for handling air or nitrogen during catalyst regeneration, purging, andstart-up.

This is the quantity of gas to be handled stated at 14.7 psia and 60 F .
Weight ﬂow

Inlet conditions
Pressure: This is the pressure of the gas at the inlet ﬂange of the compressor in psia.
Temperature: This is the temperature of the gas at the inlet ﬂange of the compressor.
Mole weight: The mole weight of the gas is calculated from the gas composition given
as part of the speciﬁcation.

Inlet volume: This is the actual volume of gas at the conditions of temperature and
pressure existing at the compressor inlet. Thus:
ACFM =SCFM ×14.7×(inlet temp F +460)

Discharge conditionsPressure: This is the pressure at the compressor outlet ﬂange and is quoted in either
psia or psig.

Cp/Cv:This will be the same as inlet.
Adiabatic efﬁciency: Will be as given in Figure 18.27.
Approximate driver horsepower
This item will include the adiabatic (or gas) horsepower as calculated in the section
on calculating the horsepower of centrifugal compressors in this chapter plus thefollowing losses:
Leakage loss— 1% of Adiabatic HPSeal losses— 35 HP for all HP ranges.Bearing loss— 5 HP for all HP ranges."
"The reminder of the spec sheet contains all the essential data and requirements that mayaffect the duty and performance of the compressor. Much of this is self explanatoryhowever there are some items that require comment. These are:
1. Most compressor installations today are under an open sided shelter with a small
overhead gantry crane assembly for maintenance.
2. Usually the lube and seal oil assemblies have their own pump and control systems.
Consequently even if the compressor itself is to be steam driven there may still be
need to give details of utilities for the ancillary equipment.
3. Details of the gas composition is essential for any development of the compressor.
This is listed on the last page of the speciﬁcation together with any notes ofimportance concerning the machine and its operation.

Calculating reciprocating compressor horsepower
Reciprocating compressors are used extensively in the process industry. They vary
in size from small units used for gas recovery (such as those on a crude distillationoverhead system) to fairly large complex machines used for recycle gas streams andfor transporting natural gas. Engineers are frequently required therefore to assess thehorsepower of these machines and their capability to handle various streams. This itemdescribes a method used to determine horsepower and proceeds with the followingsteps:
Step 1. Obtain the capacity and the properties of the gas to be handled. Fix the ultimate
(discharge) pressure level.
Step 2. From the machine data sheet ascertain the number of stages."
"Step 3. Estimate the brake horsepower from the expression:
BHP=22×(compression ratio/stage) ×number of stages
×capacity (in cuft/day ×10
6)×F
where
F=1.0 for 1 stage1.08 for 2 stages1.10 for 3 stages
Ratio/Stage =√ratio for two stages and
3√ratio for three stages.
Step 4. Check the estimate with Figure 18.28. The use of these graphs is self explana-
tory.
Step 5. Conﬁrm actual suction conditions and compression ratio required (discharge
pressure).
Step 6. Calculate compression ratio/stage.
Step 7. Calculate 1st stage discharge pressure. This will be suction pressure times
compression ratio per stage from Step 6.
Step 8. Allow about 3% for inter-stage pressure drop then calculate second stage
discharge pressure. Check that overall compression ratio/stage is close to that cal-culated for Step 6.976 CHAPTER 18
Figure 18.28. An estimate of brake horsepower per mm cfd for reciprocating compressors.
Step 9. Calculate the ‘ K’v alue of the gas. ‘ K’v alue is Cp/Cvof the gas. If the
gas is a mixture of components, ‘ K’v alue may be calculated as the sum of each
component multiplied be each of their ‘ K’v alues given in Table 18.A.1 in the
Appendix. Alternatively for a good approximation data in Figure 18.29 may be
used.

Reciprocating compressor controls and inter-cooling
A reciprocating compressor is a constant displacement type compressor. It compresses
the same volume of gas to the same pressure level without regard to whether the gas ishydrogen or butane. This characteristic makes them desirable for use in services wherethe gas will have a widely varying composition. In some cases when an extremely lowdensity gas will be compressed, a reciprocating compressor may be more economicalthan a centrifugal compressor, even though the ﬂow rate may be very high, due to thelarge number of stages required for the centrifugal.
Reciprocating compressors are widely used in process services where the ﬂow rates
are too small for centrifugal compressors. These units can be obtained with integralor coupled electric motor in sizes from a few HP to 12,000 HP and separate or integralgas drivers varying in sizes from 100 HP to 5,500 HP .
A range of air-cooled light duty compressors is available for intermittent service. They
range in size from 1/4 to about 100 HP at pressures up to 300 psig and are usuallysingle acting. A primary process use of such equipment is for starting air compres-sors on gas engine driven machines. Reciprocating compressors can be designed tohandle intermittent loads efﬁciently. This is done by using cylinder unloaders such asclearance pockets or suction valve lifters. Power losses are low at part load operationwith these devices.
Reciprocating parts and pulsating ﬂow present several engineering problems. The
foundation and piping system must be constructed to withstand the vibrations pro-duced by the compressor. The pulsating ﬂow produced by the compressor must bedampened by the use of properly engineered suction and discharge bottles. Theseproblems do not arise with the use of other types of compressors.
Reciprocating compressor control
Control of the compressor to prevent driver overload can be accomplished with clear-
ance pockets, suction valve lifters, a throttling valves in the suction line, or a control980 CHAPTER 18
valve in a bypass around the compressor. A hand operated bypass without cooler is
usually furnished inside the block valves for start-up purposes.
1. Clearance pockets
Of the above types of regulation, control by opening ﬁxed clearance pockets givesthe smoothest and most efﬁcient control within its range of application. It has thefollowing advantages:
rMinimizes the intake pulsation as the gas ﬂow is not reversed in the intake lines tothe cylinder."
"rResults in lower bearing loads as all inertia loads are cushioned.
rResults in very efﬁcient part load operation. When the gas compressed into thepockets is expanded, it follows the adiabatic line of compression and results in littlepower loss.
Clearance control has the following disadvantages which sometimes completely elim-inates it from consideration:
rWhen low ratios of compression are combined with high suction pressure, clearancepockets of sufﬁcient size to unload the compressor cannot physically be installedin the machine.
rClearance control is designed for one set of pressure conditions and any variation ineither suction or discharge pressure affects the amount of unloading accomplishedby a given pocket.
rCondensable corrosive gases sometimes cause corrosion and liquid slugging prob-lems.
2. Suction valve liftersSuction valve lifters are the other type of internal unloading devices for compressorcylinders and have characteristics that make them applicable when clearance controlis not. Suction valve lifters completely unload their end of the cylinder whenever theyare opened, regardless of the pressure. They do result in increased bearing loads dueto unbalanced inertia forces. Suction line pulsation may increase because the singleacting cylinder may excite a different frequency in the gas.
3. Suction throttle valve
A throttle valve in the suction line should be considered only for small reciprocatingcompressors. For large size machines, the suction valve cannot give tight enough shutoff to permit unloading the compressor for starting.
4. Bypass control
External bypass control around the compressor is applicable to all sizes of compres-sors. It results in a loss of power since the full compressor capacity must be compressedto and delivered at the full discharge pressure before being bled back to suction pres-sure. Care must be taken with this type of control to ensure that the bypassed gasis cooled sufﬁciently to prevent increasing the discharge temperature. This type ofPROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 981
control is preferred for installations up to several hundred horsepower because of its
smoothness and lack of complexity. Individual machines can be shutdown for largeprocess variations.
5. V ariable speed reciprocating compressors
With a variable speed driver, cylinder control can usually be eliminated and speedcontrol used to obtain desired process conditions. However, start-up unloading must befurnished, usually consisting of a hand operated bypass within the machine, or cylinderblock valves. On turbine driven reciprocating compressors economics usually dictatethat the compressor be run at constant speed and that cylinder controls or systembypasses be used to obtain the required control.
Reciprocating compressor inter-cooling
Inter-cooling for multistage compressors is advisable whenever there is a large adi-abatic temperature rise within the cylinder and the cylinder discharge temperaturewould exceed 350
◦F . When inter-cooling is employed, the inlet temperature to the
higher stage should be as close to the cooling water temperatures as practical. Onstandard commercial air inter-coolers, approach temperatures of 15–20
◦F are com-
monly used. Cooling to ﬁrst stage inlet temperature is usually economical on processgas compressors.
Inter-cooling is employed for two basic reasons:
1. For mechanical reasons whereby discharge temperature must be limited to 350
◦F
for lubrication purposes.
2. An economic reason as inter-cooling will save from 3% to 5% of the required BHP .
In general, on process compressors handling low “ n” v alue gases inter-cooling is not
employed unless the temperature limitation is exceeded. On high “ n” v alue di-atomic
gas mixtures, such as air, inter-cooling is the rule above about a 4 compression ratio
and ambient temperature at suction.
In general, cooling water for electric driven compressors can be any water available,
including salt water. (If the compressor is tied into a plant having gas engine drivencompressors, the electric driven machine should be tied into the closed system). Thecooling water should be available at a minimum pressure of 25 psig.
For estimating purposes, cooling water temperature rise across the cylinders can be
taken as 15
◦F and that across the inter and after coolers can be taken as 15◦F. Fo r
estimating purposes, cooling water requirements are as follows:
Jacket water cooling 500 Btu/BHP/hr
Inter cooler 1,000 Btu/BHP/hrAfter cooler 1,000 Btu/BHP/hr982 CHAPTER 18
Use motor rating for number of horsepower required.
If the discharge temperature of the gas does not exceed 180◦F , it is common practice
to eliminate cooling water on the cylinder and operate with cooling passages which
are ﬁlled with oil. Any jacketed cylinder must be ﬁlled with some ﬂuid to ensure eventemperature distribution.
Specifying a reciprocating compressor
As in the case of the centrifugal compressor all data necessary to give a precise"
"requirement for the duty and performance required of a reciprocating compressormust be given in the speciﬁcation sheet. Much of this data is the same as that givenin a speciﬁcation for a centrifugal compressor (discussed earlier in this chapter). Forcompleteness however all the items in a reciprocating compressor are included below:
Title block
This requires the item to be identiﬁed by item number and its title. The number of
units that the speciﬁcation refers to is also given here. For a centrifugal compressorthis will normally be just one as very seldom is a spare machine required. This maynot be so in the case of a reciprocating compressor.
Normal and rated columns
More often than not the conditions and quantities required to be handled will vary
during the operation of the machine. The two columns therefore will be completedshowing the average normal data in the ﬁrst column and the most severe conditionsand duty required by the compressor in the second. The severe conditions in columntwo are for a continuous length of operation not instantaneous peaks (or troughs) thatmay be encountered.
Gas
The composition and gas stream identiﬁcation must be included as part of the process
speciﬁcation. Usually the composition of the gas is listed on a separate sheet asshown in the example. Note in many catalytic processes that utilize a recycle gas thecomposition of the gas will change as the catalyst in the process ages. Thus it will benecessary to list the gas composition at the SOR and at the EOR.
The compressor may also be required to handle an entirely different gas stream at
some time or other. This too must be noted. For example in many petroleum reﬁningprocesses a recycle or make up compressor normally handling a light predominantlyhydrogen gas is also used for handling air or nitrogen during catalyst regeneration,purging, and start-up.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 983
V olume ﬂow
This is the quantity of gas to be handled stated at 14.7 psia and 60 F .
Weight ﬂow
This is the weight of gas to be handled in either lbs/min or lbs/hr.
Inlet conditions
In the case of multistage compressors the conditions for each stage must be shown.
Where inter stage cooling is used the effect must be reﬂected in the conditions spec-iﬁed.
Pressure: This is the pressure of the gas at the inlet of the compressor stage in psia.
Note if inter cooling is used this pressure must include the inter cooler pressure drop.Temperature: This is the temperature of the gas at the inlet of the compressor stage—
after the inter cooler if applicable.Mole weight: The mole weight of the gas is calculated from the gas composition given
as part of the speciﬁcation.
C
p/Cv: This is the ratio of speciﬁc heats of the gas again obtained from the gas mole
wt and Table 18.A.1 in the Appendix.Compressibility factor (z): use the value at inlet conditions calculated as shown in
step 7 of item on horsepower calculation for reciprocating compressors.
Inlet volume: This is the actual volume of gas at the conditions of temperature and
pressure existing at the compressor stage inlet. Thus:
ACFM =SCFM ×14.7×(inlet temp F + 460)
(60 F + 460) ×inlet press psia
Discharge conditions
Pressure: This is the pressure at each stage outlet and is quoted in either psia or psig.
Temperature: This is estimated for each stage using Figure 18.30.
Cp/Cv:This will be the same as in the inlet.
Approximate driver horsepowerThe brake horsepower for the reciprocating compressor is calculated using the method
described earlier. This is Brake Horsepower and includes an allowance for mechan-
ical inefﬁciencies. The approximate minimum driver horsepower is 1.1 ×Brake984 CHAPTER 18
Horsepower, but the approximate driver HP will be calculated using the inefﬁciencies
for leakage, seals, etc as for centrifugal compressors.
The reminder of the spec sheet contains all the essential data and requirements that may
affect the duty and performance of the compressor. Much of this is self explanatory;however there are some items that require comment. These are:
1. Most compressor installations today are under an open sided shelter with a small
overhead gantry crane assembly for maintenance.
2. Usually the lube and seal oil assemblies have their own pump and control systems.
Consequently even if the compressor itself is to be steam driven there may still be
need to give details of utilities for the ancillary equipment.
3. Details of the gas composition is essential for any development of the compressor.
This is listed on the last page of the speciﬁcation together with any notes ofimportance concerning the machine and its operation.
An example calculation for a speciﬁcation sheet follows:

operating the compressors and their ancillary equipment.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 991

Compressor drivers
Table 18.24 gives a listing of the more common types of compressor drivers. It
provides some of the data that would inﬂuence the choice of the driver. The mostcommon drivers by far in a process plant are the electric motor and the steam turbine.992 CHAPTER 18
Figure 18.31. (Cont.)
For very large machines as encountered in handling natural gas the gas turbine or gas
engine become the more prominent prime mover.
Sizing drivers
As a basic rule drivers are sized for the most severe duty required of the compressor
plus a factor as an operating contingency. In general the most severe duty is thatdesign case which has the highest suction temperature, the maximum ratio of speciﬁcheats, the lowest suction pressure, the highest required discharge pressure, and thegas molecular weight which gives the highest HP .

Mechanical efﬁciency of the power transmission.
The mechanical efﬁciency in this case includes for energy losses for bearings, seals,
lube oil etc, in the case of centrifugal compressors and gears in the case of reciprocatingcompressors.
Electric motor drivers
Squirrel cage motors are preferred for this type of duty. These may be drip proof open
type where the location is not a ﬁre or explosion hazard. Where it is required that theunits must be explosion or ﬁre proof these motors must be totally enclosed type. Insizing the motor, efﬁciencies for squirrel cage motors up to 450 HP given in item 4.6for pumps may be used. The following Table 18.25 is used for motors above 500 HP .
The driver rated brake horsepower is the compressor horsepower times a load factor
divided by a service factor. Normally the load factor is 10% and a service factor foran enclosed squirrel cage motor is 1.0 and 1.15 for an open type.

Steam turbine drivers. Next to the motor drivers steam turbines are the most common
form of drivers for rotary equipment in general and compressors in particular. The
two most common types of theses are turbines that exhaust to a lower pressure but theexhaust steam is not condensed and those in which the exhaust steam is condensed.Normally the latter is only used in the case of large driver horsepower 5,000 and above.It is far more expensive than the non condensing type as the exhaust is normallysub atmospheric in pressure and of course the cost of the condenser must be in-cluded."
"Steam turbine approximate efﬁciencies are listed in Table 18.26.These efﬁciencies are based on the exhaust pressure of the steam being 50 psig for
non condensing type and 2
/prime/primeHg Abs for the condensing type.
Determining the rated horsepower of the steam turbine driver follows closely to themethod for motor horsepower. First determine the minimum horsepower required ofthe turbine. Thus:
Step 1. Determine the minimum driver horsepower by multiplying the compressor
BHP by 1.1.
Step 2. Now the turbine will deliver the normal HP at the normal speed. A contingency
in the form of additional speed is added to the driver capability. This will be
controlled in practice by a steam governor. This contingency is usually 5% abovenormal speed.
Step 3. Horsepower capability varies as the cube of the speed. Thus the Rated horse-
power of the turbine will be:
Rated HP =Minimum HP ×(1.05)
3996 CHAPTER 18
Step 4. The amount of steam that will be used calculated by the change in enthalpy
of the inlet steam to the outlet steam at constant entropy. The change in enthalpy
for the two conditions is read from the steam Mollier diagram.
Step 5. The theoretical steam rate is:
2,544
Inlet enthalpy −Outlet enthalpy (in Btu/lb)
This ﬁgure divided by the turbine efﬁciency gives the steam rate in lbs/BHP/hr.
Example calculation
Calculate the turbine horsepower requirements and the theoretical steam rates todrive a 4,000 BHP centrifugal compressor. No gears are included in this case. Steamis available at 650 psig and 760 F . The steam will exhaust into the plant’ s 125 psigheader.
Minimum driver horsepower =4,000 ×1.1
=4,400 BHP
Rated turbine HP @ 105% speed =4,400 ×(1.05)

=5,094 HP .
Enthalpy of steam @ 650 psig and 760 F =1,390 (entropy 1.62)
Enthalpy of steam @ 125 psig =1,225 (entropy 1.62)
Difference in Enthalpy =165

Gas turbine drivers. These items of equipment are the most expensive and because
they require a high capital investment their use can only be justiﬁed as compres-sor drivers where the continual load on the compressor is also very high. Thesedrivers therefore are met mostly in the natural gas industry. They are used ex-tensively in recompressing natural gas after treating for dew point control or de-sulfurizing.
The thermal efﬁciencies of gas turbines are low (about 16–20%) but it is common
practice to use the exhaust gases which are usually at a temperature of above 800 Fin waste heat recovery. This involves exchanging the waste heat of the exhaust gasesPROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 997

ple distillation. Table 18.27 gives some turbine sizes and data. It should be notedthat considerable development work is continuing in the ﬁeld of gas turbines andconsequently the data given here may be subject to revision or updating.
To obtain the gas turbine rated horsepower for a speciﬁc compressor duty follows
closely the same calculation route as the steam turbine. Thus:
Step 1. Obtain the minimum driver horsepower by multiplying the compressor Brake
horsepower by 1.05 (BHP includes Seals, Leakage, etc).
Step 2. The rated turbine horsepower is the minimum driver HP divided by the gear
efﬁciency.
Step 3. The horsepower of the turbine selected must equal or slightly exceed the
horsepower calculated in Step 2. This HP must be corrected for site conditions as
shown in Step 4.
Step 4. The HP’ s given in Table 18.27 are at an ambient temperature of 80 F and at
an elevation of 1,000 ft. correction for any speciﬁc site is given by the followingexpression:

Ancillary equipment
Reciprocating compressor dampening facilities. Dampening facilities are used in
conjunction with reciprocating compressors to smooth out the pulsation effect of the"
"compressor action. These facilities are simply in line bottles sized larger than the gasline which cushion the gas motion. These are essential to minimize expensive pipingdesigns that would be necessary without them. Calculating the size of these bottles isimportant in the design of the compressor facilities.
The following calculation technique is used to determine the size of new dampers or
to evaluate the adequacy of an existing facility. This calculation is described by thefollowing steps:
Step 1. From compressor data sheet obtain cylinder diameter and stroke dimensions.
Step 2. Calculate the swept volume per cylinder using the expression:
πD
2
4×S
where
D=cylinder diameter
S=stroke
Step 3. Knowing the suction and discharge pressures the pulsation bottle capacity
(both suction and discharge) is obtained from Figure 18.32 in terms of a multiple
of swept volume.
Figure 18.32. Dampener bottle sizing.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 999
Step 4. Use the rule of thumb that pulsation bottle diameter equals 11/2times the
compressor cylinder diameter. Calculate the suction and discharge bottle length.

18.4 Heat exchangersType and selection of heat exchangersHeat exchange is the science that deals with the rate of heat transfer between hot and
cold bodies. There are three methods of heat transfer, they are:
rConduction
rConvection
rRadiation
In a heat exchanger heat is transferred by conduction and convection with conductionusually being the limiting factor. The equipment used in heat exchanger service isdesigned speciﬁcally for the duty required of it. That is, heat exchange equipment1000 CHAPTER 18
cannot be purchased as a stock item for a service but has to be designed for that
service.
The types of heat exchange equipment used in the process industry and their selection
for use are as follows:
The shell and tube exchanger
This is the type of exchanger most commonly used in a process plant. It consists
of a bundle of tubes encased in a shell. It is inexpensive and is easy to clean andmaintain. There are several types of shell and tube exchangers and some of thesehave removable bundles for easier cleaning. The shell and tube exchanger has a widevariety of services that it is normally used for. These include vapor condensation(condensers), process liquid cooling (coolers), exchange of heat between two processstreams (heat exchangers), and reboilers (boiling in fractionator service). Most of thischapter will be dedicated to the uses and design speciﬁcation of the shell and tube ex-changer.
The double pipe exchanger
A double pipe exchanger consists of a pipe within a pipe. One of the ﬂuid streams ﬂows
through the inner pipe while the other ﬂows through the annular space between thepipes. The exchanger can be dismantled very easily and therefore be easily cleaned.The double pipe exchanger is used for very small process units or where the ﬂuids areextremely fouling. Either true con-current or counter current ﬂows can be obtainedbut because the cost per square foot is relatively high it can only be justiﬁed for specialapplications. The following table gives the heat transfer area for various pipe lengthsand diameters:
Surface area, sqftNo of Shell Tube
tubes size, ins size, ins 10 ft 20 ft 30 ft
1 2 1 5.8 11.0 16.3
1 3 1.5 10.9 20.9 30.9
1 4 2 13.7 26.1 38.5
Extended surface or ﬁn tubes
This type of exchanger is similar to the double pipe but the inner pipe is grooved or
has longitudinal ﬁns on its outside surface. Its most common use is in the servicewhere one of the ﬂuids has a high resistance to heat transfer and the other ﬂuid has aPROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1001
low resistance to heat transfer. It can rarely be justiﬁed if the equivalent surface area
of a shell and tube exchanger is greater than 200–300 sqft.
Finned air coolers
These are the more common type of air coolers used in the process industry. Air"
"cooling for process streams gained prominence during the early 1950s. In a greatmany applications and geographic areas they had considerable economic advantageover the conventional water cooling. Indeed today it is uncommon to see processplants of any reasonable size without air coolers.
Air coolers consist of a fan and one or more heat transfer sections mounted on a
frame. In most cases these sections consist of ﬁnned tubes through which the hot ﬂuidpasses. The fan located either above or below the tube section induces or forces airaround the tubes of the section.
The selection of air coolers over shell and tube is one of cost. Usually air coolers
ﬁnd favor in condensing fractionator overheads to temperatures of about 90–100
◦F
and process liquid product streams to storage temperatures. Air coolers are widelyused in most areas of the world where ambient air temperatures are most times below90
◦F . At atmospheric temperatures above 100◦F humidiﬁers are incorporated into the
cooler design and operation. The cost under these circumstances is greatly increasedand their use is often not justiﬁed.
In very cold climates the air temperature around the tubes is controlled to avoid the
skin temperature of the ﬂuid being cooled falling below a freezing criteria or in the caseof petroleum products its pour point. This control is achieved by louvers installed torecirculate the air ﬂow or by varying the quantity of air ﬂow by changing the fan pitch.
Box coolers
These are the simplest form of heat exchange. However they are generally less efﬁ-
cient, more costly and require a large area of the plant plot. They consist of a singlecoil or “ worm” submerged in a bath of cold water. The ﬂuid ﬂows through the coil tobe cooled by the water surrounding it. The box cooler found use in the older petroleumreﬁneries for cooling heavy residuum to storage temperatures. Modern day practiceis to use a tempered water system where the heavy oil is cooled on the shell side of ashell & tube exchanger against water at a controlled temperature ﬂowing in the tubeside. The water is recycled through an air cooler to control its temperature to a levelwhich will not cause the skin temperature of the oil in the shell & tube exchanger tofall below its pour point.1002 CHAPTER 18
Direct contact condensers
In this exchanger the process vapor to be condensed comes into direct contact with
the cooling medium (usually water). This contact is made in a packed section of asmall tower. The most common use for this type of condenser is in vacuum producingequipment. Here the vapor and motive steam for each ejector stage is condensed in apacked direct contact condenser. This type has a low pressure drop which is essentialfor the vacuum producing process.
General design considerations
Basic heat transfer equationsThe following equations deﬁne the basic heat transfer relationships.These equations are used to determine the overall surface area required for the transfer
of heat from a hot source to a cold source.
The overall heat transfer equation
The usual heat transfer mechanism are conduction, natural convection, forced con-vection, condensation, and vaporization. When heat is transferred by these means theoverall equation is as follows:
Q=UA(/Delta1t
m)
where
Q=Heat transferred in Btu/hr
U=Overall heat transfer coefﬁcient, Btu/hr/sqft/◦F
A=Heat transfer surface area, sqft.
/Delta1tm=Corrected log mean temperature difference,◦F
The overall heat transfer coefﬁcient UThis coefﬁcient is the summation of all the resistances to the ﬂow of heat in thetransfer mechanism. These resistances are the resistance to heat transfer contained inthe ﬂuids, the resistance caused by fouling, and the resistance to heat transfer of thetube wall. The resistance to the ﬂow of heat from the liquid outside the tube wall ismeasured by the ﬁlm coefﬁcient of that ﬂuid. The resistance of the ﬂow of heat fromthe ﬂuid inside the tube is similarly the ﬁlm coefﬁcient of the inside ﬂuid. These ﬁlmcoefﬁcients are products of dimensionless numbers which include:
rThe Reynolds Number
rThe Graetz Number
rThe Grashof NumberPROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1003
rThe Nusselt Number
rThe Peclet Number
rThe Prandtl Number
rThe Stanton Number
The format of these numbers and their use are found in all standard text books on
heat transfer. For example: Kern’ s Process Heat Transfer, and McAdams Heat Trans-
mission.
These resistances are deﬁned therefore by the following expression:
1
Uo=1
ho+1
hi×Ao
Ai+1
hw+(rf)o+(rf)i×Ao

Uo=overall heat transfer coefﬁcient based on outside tube surface, in Btu/hr/sqft/◦F.
h=The ﬁlm coefﬁcient in Btu/hr/sqft/◦F.
rf=fouling factors in1
Btu/hr/sqft/◦F
hw=Heat transfer rate through tube wall in Btu/hr/sqft/◦F.
A=Surface area in sqft
subscripts “ o” and “ i” refer to outside surface and inside surface, respectively.
Flow arrangements
The two more common ﬂow paths are Con-current and Counter-current. In Con-"
"current ﬂow both the hot ﬂuid and the cold ﬂuid ﬂow in the same direction. This is theleast desirable of the ﬂow arrangement and is only used in those chemical processeswhere there is a danger of the cooling ﬂuid congealing, subliming, or crystallizing atnear ambient temperatures.
Counter-current ﬂow is the most desirable arrangement. Here the hot ﬂuid enters at
one end of the exchanger and the cold ﬂuid enters at the opposite end. The streamsﬂow in opposite directions to one another. This arrangement allows the two streamsexit temperatures to approach one another.
Logarithmic mean temperature difference /Delta1t
m
In either counter-current or con-current ﬂow arrangement the log mean temperature
difference used in the overall heat transfer equation is determined by the following1004 CHAPTER 18
expression:
/Delta1tm=/Delta1t1−/Delta1t2
ln/Delta1t1
/Delta1t2
The/Delta1t’ s are the temperature differences at each end of the exchanger and /Delta1t1is the
larger of the two. In true counter-current ﬂow the /Delta1tmcalculated can be used directly
in the overall heat transfer equation. However such a situation is not common and true
counter-current ﬂow rarely exists. Therefore a correction factor needs to be appliedto arrive at the correct /Delta1t
m. These are given in Figure A9.1 in the Appendix.
Fluid velocities and pressure drops
Film coefﬁcients are a function of ﬂuid velocity, density (vapor), and viscosity
(liquids). Within limits increasing the velocity of a ﬂuid reduces its resistance toheat transfer (i.e., it increases its heat transfer coefﬁcient). Increasing the ﬂuid ve-locity however increases its pressure drop. An economic balance needs to be soughttherefore between the cost of heat transfer surface and pumping cost. This exerciseshould be undertaken to ﬁnd a pay-out balance of 2–4 years. This exercise has beendone many times and the following data is considered a reasonable balance betweenvelocity and pressure drop for some common cases:
Tube side Shell side

Note 1: Normally erosion by suspended solids in liquids occurs at velocities of above 6 ft/sec.
For condensing steam pressure drop is usually not critical but a minimum steam
pressure drop is desirable. Allowable steam velocities in tubes are as follows:PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1005

Atmos to 100 psig 175Above 100 psig 150
Choice of tube side versus shell side
There are no hard and fast rules governing which ﬂuid ﬂows on which side in a heat
exchanger. Much is left to the discretion of the individual engineer and his or herexperience. There are some guidelines and these are as follows:
(i)Tube side ﬂow
Fouling liquids.
Tube cleaning is much easier than cleaning the outside of the tubes. Also fouling canbe reduced by higher tube side velocities.
Corrosive ﬂuids. It is cheaper to replace tubes than shells and shell bafﬂes so as a
general rule corrosive ﬂuids are put on the tube side. There are exceptions and a
major one are those corrosive ﬂuids that become more corrosive at high velocities.An example of this are naphthenic acids, which are present in some crude oils andtheir products.
High pressure. Fluids at high pressure are usually put on the tube side as only the
tubes, tube sheet, and channel need to be rated for high pressure in the unit design.
This cheapens the overall cost of the exchanger.
Suspended solids. Fluids containing suspended solids should whenever possible be
put to ﬂow tube side. Shell side ﬂows invariably have “ dead spaces”where solids
come out of suspension and build up to cause fouling.
Cold boxes. These are exchangers used in cryogenic processes where condensing of
a vapor on one side of the exchanger is accompanied by boiling of a liquid on the
other side. The condensing ﬂuid is preferred on the tube side. Better control of therefrigerant ﬂow is accomplished by the level control across the shell side.
(ii)Shell side ﬂow
Available pressure drop. Shell side ﬂows generally require lower pressure drop than
tube side. Therefore if a system is pressure drop limiting it should be routed to the
shell side.1006 CHAPTER 18
Condensers. Condensing vapors should ﬂow on the shell side wherever possible. The
larger free area provided by the shell side space permits minimum pressure drop and
higher condensate loading through better ﬁlm heat transfer coefﬁcients.
Large ﬂow rates. In cases where both streams are of a similar nature with similar
properties the stream with the largest ﬂow rate should be sent to the shell side where"
"the difference in ﬂow rates are signiﬁcant. The shell side provides more ﬂexibility indesign by bafﬂe arrangements to give the best heat transfer design criteria.
Boiling service. The boiling liquid as in the case of reboilers, waste heat recovery
units and the like should be on the shell side of the exchanger. This allows space for
the proper disengaging of the vapor phase and provides a means of controlling thesystem by level control of the liquid phase.
Types of shell and tube exchangers
Figure 18.33 gives some of the more common arrangements in shell and tube ex-
changer design. The arrangements shown here are all one shell pass and one or twotube passes. Equipment with more than two tube passes (up to ﬁve) is also fairlycommon particularly in petroleum reﬁning. Shell arrangements are however left atone if at all possible. Where multi-pass shell side is required companies prefer to usecomplete exchangers in series or in parallel or both rather than making two or moreshell passes using horizontal bafﬂing in one exchanger.
Estimating shell and tube surface area and pressure drop
There are many excellent computer programs available that calculate exchanger sur-
face area and pressure drops from simple input. The actual calculation when donemanually is tedious and long. However to understand a little of the importance ofthe input required by these computer programs it does well to at least view a typicalmanual calculation. The one given here is for a shell and tube cooler with no changeof phase for either tube side or shell side ﬂuids.
The calculation follows these steps:
Step 1. Establish the following data by heat balances or from observed plant readings:
rThe inlet and outlet temperatures on the shell side and on the tube side.
rThe ﬂow of tube side ﬂuid and that for the shell side. It may be necessary to
calculate one or the other from a heat balance over the exchanger.
rCalculate the duty of the exchanger in heat units per unit time (usually hours).
rEstablish the stream properties for tube side and shell side ﬂuids. The propertiesrequired are: SG, Viscosity, Speciﬁc heats, Thermal conductivity.Figure 18.33. Some Common types of shell and tube exchangers. (a) Fixed tube sheet. (b) Removable bundle.1008 CHAPTER 18
Step 2. Calculate the log mean temperature difference (/Delta1t m).
Assume a ﬂow pattern (i.e. either co current or counter-current). Most ﬂows will
be a form of counter-current. Then show the temperature ﬂow as follows:
Shell In −−−−−−−−−− →/H17012Shell Out
Tube out/H17011←−−−−−−−−− −Tube In
Temp difference /Delta1t1 /Delta1t2
The log mean temperature difference is then calculated using the expression:
/Delta1tm=/Delta1t1−/Delta1t2
loge/Delta1t1
/Delta1t2
This temperature needs to be corrected for the ﬂow pattern, and this is done usingthe correction factors given in Figure 18.A.1. The use of these are self explanatoryand are given in the ﬁgure.
Step 3. Calculate the approximate surface area.
From Table 18.A.2 in the Appendix select a suitable overall heat transfer coefﬁcientU in Btu’ s/hr. sqft. F . Use the expression to calculate for ‘ A’:
Q=UA/Delta1t
m
where
Q=Heat transferred in Btu/hr. (the exchanger duty)
U=Overall heat transfer coefﬁcient.
A=Exchanger surface area in sqft.
/Delta1tm=Log mean Temperature difference (corrected for ﬂow pattern) in◦F.
From the surface area calculated select the tube size and pitch. Usually 3/4ins on
a triangular pitch for clean service and 1/prime/primeon a square pitch for dirty or fouling
service. A single standard shell will hold about 4,100 sqft of surface per pass. Nowmost companies do not use multi-pass shells and prefer sets of shells in series if thisbecomes necessary. The ‘ norm’therefore are single pass shells each containing upto 4,100 sqft of surface.
Step 4. Calculate the tube side ﬂow and the number of passes.
If it cannot be read from plant data calculate tube side ﬂow in cuft/hr by heat balance.Select the tube gauge and length. The tube data are given in Table 18.A.3 in theAppendix and standard lengths of tubes are 16 and 20 ft. Calculate the number ofselected tubes per pass from the expression:
Np=Ft×144
3,600 ×At×VtPROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1009
where
Np=number of tubes per pass
Ft=tube side ﬂow in cuft/hr
At=cross-sectional area of 1 tube
Vt=linear velocity in tube in ft/sec
See earlier item on ‘ Fluid Velocities and Pressure Drop’ for recommended ﬂuid ve-
locities. The number of tube passes is arrived at by dividing the total surface area re-quired by the total (external) surface area of the number of tubes per pass calculatedabove.
Step 5. Calculate tube side ﬁlm coefﬁcient corrected to outside diameter ( h
io).
The tube side ﬁlm coefﬁcient may be calculated for water by the expression:
hio=300×(Vt×tube i/d ins)0.8
tube o/d ins
where
hio=Inside ﬁlm coefﬁcient based on outside tube diameter in Btu/hr sqft◦F.
Vt=linear velocity of water tube side in ft/sec.
For ﬂuids other than water ﬂowing tube side use the expression:"
"hio=K
Do(Cµ/K)1/6(µ/µ w)·φ(DG.14/µ)
where
hio=inside ﬁlm coefﬁcient based on outside diameter in Btu/hr sqft◦F.
K=thermal conductivity of the ﬂuid in Btu/hr sqft (◦F per ft). See

G=mass velocity in lbs/sec sqft.
µ=Absolute viscosity Cps at average ﬂuid temp.
µw=Absolute viscosity Cps at average tube wall temp.
φ(DG/µ)=from Figure 18.34.
Step 6. Calculate shell side dimensions.
First determine the shell side average ﬁlm temperature as follows:
Inlet ave =T1+T2
2Outlet ave =T3+T4

where
T1=Shell ﬂuid inlet temperature.
T2=Tube outlet temperature.
T3=Shell outlet temperature.
T4=Tube inlet temperature.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1011
Average shell side ﬁlm temperature:
Inlet ave +outlet ave
2
Use this temperature to determine density and viscosity used in the shell side ﬁlm
coefﬁcient calculations.
The shell diameter. Next calculate the diameter of the tube bundle and the shell
diameter. For this use one of the following equations to calculate the number of tubesacross the center line of the bundle:
1. For square pitch tube arrangement:
T
cl=1.19 (number of tubes)0.5
2. For triangular pitch tube arrangement:
Tcl=1.10 (number of tubes)0.5
Note these are total number of tubes; namely, those calculated in Step 4 times number
of tube passes.
Set number of bafﬂes and their pitch. The type of bafﬂes usually used are shown in
Figure 18.35. Disc and donut type bafﬂes are only used where pressure drop available
is very small and there is a pressure drop problem. Bafﬂes on the bias are used in sqpitch tube arrangement and bafﬂes perpendicular to the tubes are usual for triangulartube arrangements.
The minimum bafﬂe pitch should not be less than 16% of the shell diameter. Pitch in
this case is the space between two adjacent bafﬂes. Normally 20% of shell i/d is usedfor the bafﬂe pitch. The number of bafﬂes is calculated from the expression:
N
B=10×tube length
bafﬂe pitch % ×diameter of shell.
Free area of ﬂow between bafﬂes. The space available for ﬂow on the shell side is
calculated as:
W=Di−(do×Tcl)
where
W=space available for ﬂow in sq ins.
Di=shell inside diameter in ins.
do=tube outside diameter in ins.
Tcl=number of tubes across centerline.
The free area of ﬂow between bafﬂes is now calculated as follows:
Af=W×(Bp−0.187)1012 CHAPTER 18
Figure 18.35. Types of bafﬂes.
where
Af=free ﬂow area between bafﬂes in sq ins.
Bp=bafﬂe pitch in ins.
Step 7. Calculate the shell side ﬁlm coefﬁcient ho.
The following expression is used to determine the outside ﬁlm coefﬁcient:
ho=K
do(Cµ/K)1/3·φ(doGm/µf)·4Pb
D
where
ho=outside ﬁlm coefﬁcient in Btu/hr sqft◦F
Gm=maximum mass velocity in lbs/sec. sqft
do=outside tube diameter in ins
K=thermal conductivity.
C=speciﬁc heat of ﬂuid in Btu/lb/F
µf=viscosity at mean ﬁlm temperature in Cps
Pb=bafﬂe pitch in ins
D=shell internal diameter in insPROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1013

φ(doGm/µf) is a function of the Reynolds number read from Figure 18.36. The
Reynolds Number is:
Re=doGm
µf
where Gm=lbs/sec sqft.
This ﬁlm coefﬁcient is corrected for the type of bafﬂe and tube arrangement by
multiplying it by one of the following factors:
For square pitch vertical to tube rows 0.50
square pitch on the bias 0.55
triangular tube pitch 0.701014 CHAPTER 18

Compare the calculated value of the overall heat transfer coefﬁcient with the as-
sumed one in step 3.If there is agreement within ±10% then the calculated one will be used for revising
the calculation for surface area and the other dimensions. If there is no agreementrepeat the calculation using a new value for the assumed U.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1015

Air coolers and condensers
Air cooling of process streams or condensing of process vapors is more widely used
in the process industry than cooling or condensing by exchange with cooling water.The use of individual air coolers for process streams using modern design techniqueshas economized in plant area required. It has also made obsolete those large coolingtowers and ponds associated with product cooling. This item of the chapter describesair coolers in general and outlines a method to estimate surface area, motor horsepowerand plant area required by the unit.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1017
Figure 18.38. Pressure drop factor F SPfor ﬂows across banks of tubes.
As in the case for shell and tube exchangers there are many excellent computer pro-
grams that can be used for the design of air coolers. The method given here for suchcalculation may be used in the absence of a computer program or for a good esti-mate of a unit. The method also emphasizes the importance of the data supplied tomanufacturers for the correct speciﬁcation of the units.
General description of air coolers/condensers
Figures 18.39 show the two types of air coolers used in the process industry. Both units
consist of a bank of tubes through which the ﬂuid to be cooled or condensed ﬂows. Airis passed around the tubes either by a fan located below the tubes forcing air throughthe tube bank or a fan located above the tube bank drawing air through the tube bank.The ﬁrst arrangement is called ‘ forced draft’and the second ‘ induced draft’ .
Air in both cases is motivated by a fan or fans driven by an electric motor or a
steam turbine or in some cases a gas turbine. The fan and prime driver are normallyconnected by a ‘ V’belt or by a shaft and gear box. Electric motor drives are by farthe most common prime drivers for air coolers.
The units may be installed on a structure at grade or as is often the case on a structure
above an elevated pipe rack. Most air coolers in condensing service are elevated abovepipe racks to allow free ﬂow of condensate into a receiving drum.1018 CHAPTER 18

Thermal rating
Thermal rating of an air cooler is similar in some respects to that for a shell and tube
described in the previous item. The basic energy equation
Q=U/Delta1TA
is used to determine the surface area required. The calculation for Uis different in
that it requires the calculation for the air side ﬁlm coefﬁcient. This ﬁlm coefﬁcient isPROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1019
usually based on an extended surface area which is formed by adding ﬁns to the bare
surface of the tubes. Thermal rating, surface area, fan dimensions and horsepower arecalculated by the following steps:
Step 1. Calculate the heat duty and the tube side material characteristics.
Step 2. Calculate the log mean temperature for the exchanger.
Using the following equation determine the temperature rise for the air ﬂowing
over the tubes:

Condensers
In petroleum reﬁning and most other chemical process plants vapors are condensed
either on the shell side of a shell and tube exchanger, the tube side of an air cooler,or by direct contact with the coolant in a packed tower. By far the most commonof these operations are the ﬁrst two listed. In the case of the shell and tube con-denser the condensation may be produced by cooling the vapor by heat exchangewith a cold process stream or by water. Air cooling has overtaken the shell and tubecondenser in the case of water as coolant in popularity as described in the previousitem.
In the design or performance analysis of condensers the procedure for determining
thermal rating and surface area is more complex than that for a single phase coolingand heating. In condensers there are three mechanisms to be considered for the ratingprocedure. These are:
rThe resistance to heat transfer of the condensing ﬁlm
rThe resistance to heat transfer of the vapor cooling
rThe resistance to heat transfer of the condensate ﬁlm cooling
Each of these mechanisms is treated separately and along pre-selected sections of theexchanger. The procedure for determining the last two of the mechanisms followsthat described earlier for single phase heat transfer. The following expression is usedto calculate the ﬁlm coefﬁcient for the condensing vapor:

Again there are many excellent computer programs that calculate condenser thermal
ratings, and these of course save the tedium of the manual calculation. However nomatter which method of calculation is selected there is required one major additionalpiece of data over that required for single phase heat exchange. That item is theenthalpy curve for the vapor.
Enthalpy curves are given as the heat content per lb or per hour contained in the mixed
phase condensing ﬂuid plotted against temperature. An example of such a curve isgiven in Figure 18.43. These Enthalpy curves are developed from the vapor/liquid orﬂash calculations described in Chapter 3 of this volume.
Brieﬂy the calculation for the curve commences with determining the dew point of
the vapor and the bubble point of the condensate. Three or more temperatures arePROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1027
selected between the dew and bubble points and the V/Lcalculation of the ﬂuid at
these temperatures carried out. Enthalpy for the vapor phase and the liquid phase are
added for each composition of the phases at the selected temperatures. These togetherwith the enthalpy at dew point and bubble point are then plotted.
As in the case of the shell and tube exchanger and the air cooler a manual calculation
for condensers is described here. Again this is done to provide some understanding ofthe data required to size such a unit and its signiﬁcance in the calculation procedure.Computer aided designs should however be used for these calculations wheneverpossible.
The following calculation steps describe a method for calculating the ﬁlm coefﬁcient
of a vapor condensing on the shell side of a S&T exchanger. The complete ratingcalculation will not be given here as much of the remaining calculation is simplyrepetitive.
Step 1. Calculate the dew point of the vapor stream at its source pressure. Estimate
the pressure drop across the system. Usually 3–5 psi will account for piping and
the exchanger pressure drop. Calculate the bubble point of the condensate at theterminal pressure. Select three or more temperatures between dew point and bubblepoint and calculate the vapor/liquid quantities at these conditions of temperatureand pressure.
Step 2. Calculate the enthalpy of the vapor and liquid at these temperatures. Plot the
total enthalpies against temperature to construct the enthalpy curve. Establish theproperties of the vapor phase and liquid phase for each temperature interval.The properties mostly required are Sg, viscosity, Mole wt, thermal conductivity,and speciﬁc heats.
Step 3. In the case of a water cooler calculate the duty of the exchanger and the"
"quantity of water in lbs/hr. Commence the heat transfer calculation by assumingan overall heat transfer coefﬁcient (use the data given in Table A9.1). Calculatingthe corrected LMTD, and the surface area.
Step 4. Using the surface area calculated in step 3 deﬁne the exchanger geometry in
terms of number of tube passes, number of tubes on the center line, shell diameter,bafﬂe arrangement and the shell free ﬂow area. Calculate also the water ﬂow infeet per sec.
Step 5. Divide the exchanger into 3 or 4 zones by selecting the zone temperatures on
the enthalpy curve. Calculate the average weight of vapor and the average weight ofcondensate in each zone. Using these averages calculate the average heat transferredfor:Cooling of the vapor Q

Step 6. Calculate the ﬁlm coefﬁcient for the tube side ﬂuid. See previous item ‘ Esti-
mating Shell and Tube Surface Area and Pressure Drop’ .
Step 7. Starting with zone 1 and knowing the outlet temperature of the coolant ﬂuid,
the total heat duty of the zone, and the shell side temperatures calculate the coolant
inlet temperature. Using this calculate the LMTD for the zone and, assuming a zoneoverall heat transfer coefﬁcient U, calculate a surface area for the zone. Using this
and the total exchanger area estimated in step 4 establish L
cin feet.
Step 8. Calculate the condensing ﬁlm coefﬁcient from the equation given earlier. This
will be an uncorrected value for h c. This will be corrected to account for turbulence
by the expression:
hc (corr)=hc×(Gv/5)
where
Gv=average vapor mass velocity in lbs/hr ·sqft
Step 9. Calculate the value of Gvusing the free ﬂow area allocated to the vapor γv.
The following expressions are used for this:

will be the procedure used for a single phase cooling given in a previous item.This is corrected to account for resistance of the condensate ﬁlm by the expres-sion:

Step 11. Calculate the ﬁlm coefﬁcient for the condensate cooling mechanism. Again
this is the procedure described in the Item for single phase cooling on the shellside. This is corrected for drip cooling that occurs over a tube bank.

ho=−Qzone
Qc
hc+Qv
hv+QL
hL
where
Qc,Qv,QLare the enthalpies for condensing, vapor cooling, and condensate cool-
ing, respectively.
Step 13. Calculate the overall heat transfer coefﬁcient neglecting the shell side coef-
ﬁcient from Step 12. Thus:
1
Ux=ro+rw+rio+Rio
where
ro,rw,rioare fouling factors for shell ﬂuid, wall, and tube side ﬂuid respectively.
Riois the tube side ﬁlm coefﬁcient calculated in Step 6.
Step 14. Calculate the overall heat transfer coefﬁcient Uzonefor the zone using the
expression:
Uzone=ho×Ux
ho+Ux
Check the calculated Uagainst that assumed for the zone. Repeat the calculation
if necessary to make a match.
Step 15. Calculate the zone area using the acceptable calculated U. Repeat steps 7
through 14 for the other zones. The total surface area is the sum of those for each
zone.
Reboilers
Reboilers are used in fractionation to provide a heat source to the system, and to
generate a stripping vapor stream to the tower. Reboilers are operated either by thenatural circulation of a ﬂuid or by forced circulation of the ﬂuid to be reboiled. Thischapter deals only with natural circulation reboilers.
There are three common types of reboilers and these are:
rThe kettle type reboiler
rThe once through thermosyphon reboiler
rThe re-circulating thermosyphon reboiler1030 CHAPTER 18
The kettle reboiler
This type of reboiler (Figure 18.44) is extremely versatile. It can handle a very wide
range of vaporization loads. (e.g., when used as LPG vaporizer for fuel gas purposesit vaporizes 100% of the feed). The equipment consists of a large shell into whichis ﬁtted a tube bundle through which the heating medium ﬂows. The liquid to bereboiled enters the bottom of the shell at the end adjacent to the tube inlet/outletchamber. The liquid is boiled and partially vaporized by ﬂowing across the tubebundle. The diameter of the shell is sized such that there is sufﬁcient space abovethe tube bundle and the top of the shell to allow some disengaging of the liquid andvapor. A bafﬂe weir is installed at the end of the tube bundle furthest from the inlet.This bafﬂe weir establishes a liquid level over the tube bundle in the shell. The boilingliquid ﬂows over this weir to the shell outlet nozzle, while the vapor generated isallowed to exit from the top of the shell through one or two nozzles."
"The space downstream of the weir is sized for liquid holdup to satisfy the surge
requirements for the product. Thus it is not necessary to provide space in the bottomof the tower for product surge. If the heating medium is non fouling it is permissibleto use U tubes for the tube bundle. Otherwise the tube bundle must be of the ﬂoatinghead type. The kettle type reboiler should always be the ﬁrst type to be considered ifthere are no elevation constraints to pumping the bottoms product away.
Once through thermosyphon reboiler
This type of reboiler and its location relative to the tower is given in the sketch below:
As required for circulation
Product  
3.0 ft min. 
GradeFigure 18.44. The components of a kettle reboiler.1032 CHAPTER 18
This type of reboiler should be considered when a relatively high amount of surge
is required for the bottom product and when it is necessary to provide head for theproduct pump (NPSH requirement).
This type of reboiler takes the liquid from the bottom tray of the fractionator as feed.
This stream enters the shell side of a vertical single tube pass shell and tube exchangerby gravity head to the bottom of the shell. The heating medium ﬂows tube side topartially vaporize the liquid feed. A siphoning effect is caused by the difference indensity between the reboiler feed and the vapor/liquid efﬂuent. This allows the reboilerefﬂuent to exit from the top of the shell side and reenter the tower where the vapordisengages from the liquid phase. The liquid is the bottom product of the fractionatorand is discharged from the bottom of the tower.
Both the kettle type and the once through thermo-siphon type constitute a theoretical
tray as regards fractionation. Unlike the kettle reboiler the once through thermo-siphonis limited to a vaporization of not more than 60% of the feed. The low holdup of thefeed from a tray results in severe surging through the reboiler at high vaporizationrates.
The re-circulating thermo-siphon reboiler
When vaporization rates higher than 60% of reboiler feed is required and a kettle re-
boiler is unsuitable a recirculating Thermo-siphon type reboiler should be considered.A sketch showing this type of reboiler is given below:
As required for circulation  
Product  
       3.0 ft min.
Grade  
This reboiler is similar to the once through thermo-siphon in as far as it operatesby ﬂowing a liquid feed through the shell side of the vertical reboiler by the siphonPROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1033
mechanism. In the case of the recirculating reboiler however the feed to the reboiler
is a stream of the bottom product from the fractionator. This is vaporized as describedearlier and the liquid/vapor efﬂuent returned to the tower. The vaporization by thisreboiler can exceed 60% without danger of surging. However vaporization in this typeof reboiler should not exceed 80%. Its action is directed solely to imputing heat tothe tower and, because it recycles the same composition stream to the tower bottom,it cannot be considered as a theoretical fractionating tray. (Although some amount offractionation does occur in this system).
Note in the description of both the thermo-siphon type reboilers the heating ﬂuid is
shown as ﬂowing tube side. There may be cases where this stream will be routedshell side and the reboil ﬂuid directed tube side. Some guidance to this selection isprovided by the following preference for tube side ﬂuid:
1. Corrosive or fouling ﬂuids.
2. The less viscous of the two ﬂuids.3. The ﬂuid under the higher pressure.4. Condensing steam.
Reboiler sizing
As in the case of most heat exchangers the sizing calculation is quite rigorous and
complex. Normally process engineers rarely need to compute this in detail. Therewill be need however to estimate the size of these items for cost purposes or for plotlayout studies. This sizing is greatly simpliﬁed by applying heat ﬂux quantities to thepredetermined reboiler duty. Heat ﬂux is the value of heat transferred per unit timeper sqft of surface. The following list gives a range of heat ﬂuxes that have been usedin design and observed in operating units.

The duty of the reboiler is obtained by the overall heat balance over the tower. This
is accomplished by equating the total heat out of a fractionating tower to the heatsupplied, making the reboiler duty the unknown in the heat supplied statement. Nowthe heat out of the fractionator is the total heat in the products leaving plus thecondenser duty. The heat supplied to the tower is the heat brought in with the feed,and the heat supplied by the reboiler.1034 CHAPTER 18
Example calculation
The feed to a fractionator is 87,960 lbs/hr of mixed hydrocarbons. It enters the tower asa vapor and liquid stream and has a total enthalpy of 15.134 mm Btu/hr. The overheadproducts are a distillate and a vapor stream at 95"
"◦F . The vapor is 1,590 lb/hr with an
enthalpy of 320 Btu/lb. The distillate is 8,028 lbs/hr with an enthalpy of 170 Btu/hr.The bottom product from the tower is 78,342 lbs/hr and leaves as a liquid at its boilingpoint at 440
◦F . Its enthalpy is 370 Btu/lb. The overhead condenser duty is 4.278 mm
Btu/lb. Calculate the reboiler duty.

Then

Using a heat ﬂux of 15,000 Btu/hr sqft the surface area for the reboiler becomes
20002000
15,000=1,333.5 sqft.
Estimating the liquid and vapor ﬂow from the reboiler
It is necessary to know the vapor and liquid ﬂow leaving the reboiler and entering thetower for the following reasons:
rTo establish that there is sufﬁcient vapor rising in the tower to strip the bottomproduct effectively
rTo establish the vapor loading to the bottom tray for calculating the tray loadingPROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1035
rTo be able to calculate the driving force for ﬂow through the exchanger in the case
of thermo-siphon reboilers
The calculation of this ﬂow is again based on a heat balance. In this case it is the heatbalance across the reboiler itself. With the duty of the reboiler now established bythe overall tower heat balance, as described above, the balance over the reboiler canproceed as follows:

The temperature of the bottom tray (430◦F) is estimated from a straight line temper-
ature proﬁle of the tower. As a rule of thumb— for a 30 to 40 tray tower the bottomtray will be about 10
◦F lower than the bottom temperature.
Again Heat In =Heat Out
Then 48.910 +369 V =28.986 +458 V
V=223,865 lbs/hr1036 CHAPTER 18
Now the mole weight of the vapor is determined from the bubble point calculation of
the bottom product used to determine the tower bottom temperature (see Chapter 1).In the case of the calculation example given above the bubble point calculation forthe bottom product was as follows:

Calculating the pressure head driving force through a thermo-siphon reboiler
The big advantage of thermo-siphon reboilers is that there are no working parts, suchas pumps, that can go wrong and cause failure. However a major cause of failure in athermo-siphon reboiler is loss of driving force to move the ﬂuid over or through thetube bundle. This problem mostly occurs during commissioning when the reboilerhas been incorrectly positioned relative to the tower nozzles, or during start up wheredebris left after maintenance blocks one or other of the nozzles. In both these cases theproblem is really the loss of pressure head that drives the ﬂuid to be reboiled throughthe exchanger. The calculation to determine the theoretical driving force is based onthe density of the incoming liquid, the head of that liquid to the inlet nozzle, thedensity of the out ﬂowing liquid/vapor ﬂuid, and its head. An example of a pressuredriving force calculation based on a once through thermo-siphon (as shown in thediagram below) is as follows. The ﬂow data is based on the heat balance given earlierin this item.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1037

18.5 Fired Heaters
Types of ﬁred heatersThis chapter provides some features and detail of ﬁred heaters.Most chemical plants and all petroleum reﬁneries contain ﬁred heaters as a means
of providing heat energy into a system. Because the equipment utilizes an outsidesource of fuel it is usually supported and enhanced by a heat exchange system tominimize the quantity of fuel required.
Generally ﬁred heaters fall into two major categories:
rHorizontal type
rVertical type
The horizontal type heater usually means a box type heater with the tubes running
horizontally along the walls. Vertical type is normally a cylindrical heater contain-ing vertical tubes. Figures 18.46 and 18.47 show examples of these two types ofheaters.
These ﬁgures also give some nomenclature used in describing these items of equip-
ment. Other terms used in connection with ﬁred heaters are as follows:
Headers & Return Bends: are the ﬁttings used to connect individual tubes.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1041
Figure 18.46. Horizontal type heater.
Terminals: are the inlet and outlet connections.
Crossovers: are the piping used to connect the radiant with the convection section;
usually external to the heater.
Manifold: is the external piping used to connect the heater passes to the process
piping; may be furnished with the heater.Figure 18.47. Vertical type heater.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1043
Setting: any and all parts that form:
(a) coil supports
(b) enclosure (housing)
Casing: Is the steel shell which encloses the heater.
Bridge wall or partition wall: are the refractory walls inside the heater that divide the
radiant section into separately ﬁred zones.
Shield tubes or shock tubes: are the ﬁrst 2 or 3 rows of tubes in the convection section.
They protect or shield the convection tubes from direct radiant heat and must have
the same metallurgy as the radiant tubes and have no ﬁns.
Air plenum: is the chamber enclosing burners under the heater and having louvers to
control the air ﬂow.Cylindrical heaters require less plot space and are usually less expensive. They also
have better radiant symmetry than the horizontal type.
Horizontal box types are preferred for crude oil heaters, although vertical cylindrical
heaters have been used in this service. Vacuum unit heaters should have horizontaltubes to eliminate the static head pressure at the bottom of vertical tubes and to reducethe possibility of two-phase slugging in the large exit tubes."
"Occasionally, several different services (“ coils” ) may be placed in a single heater with
a cost saving. This is possible if the services are closely tied to each other in the process.Catalytic reforming pre-heater and re-heaters in one casing is an example. Reactorheater and stripper reboiler in one casing is another example. This arrangement ismade possible by using a refractory partition wall to separate the radiant coils. Theseparate radiant coils may be controlled separately over a wide range of conditions bymeans of their own controls and burners. If a convection section is used, it is usuallycommon to the several services. If maintenance on one coil is required, the entire heatermust be shut down. Also, the range of controllability is less than with separate heaters.
Each of these types may be shop fabricated if size permits. Shop fabrication reduces
costs. However, shop fabrication should not be forced to the extent of getting animproperly proportioned heater.
Codes and standards
Fired heaters have a “ live”source of energy. That is, they use a ﬂammable mate-
rial in order to impart heat energy to a process stream. Because of this the design,1044 CHAPTER 18
construction and operation of process ﬁred heaters and boilers are strictly controlled
by legislative and other codes and standards. This item outlines some of the moreimportant of these codes and standards which need to be recognized by engineersdealing with ﬁred heaters in any way.
Codes and standards directly applicable to ﬁred heaters are listed below. In addition,
there are many codes and standards covering such factors as materials, welding,refractories, structural steel, etc., which apply to ﬁred heaters.

and Stacks.
This reference gives a general description of ﬁred heaters and describes how to inspect
them, what damage to look for, and how to report the results of the inspection.

These are applicable in process plants if steam is generated, superheated or boiler feed
water preheated in the convection section. Special materials are required accordingto ASME Section I. The external piping and pressure relieving devices must also bein accordance with ASME Section I.
Contractors’ standards
These will be covered in the “ Narrative Speciﬁcation” for the particular job and/or
heater. The narrative speciﬁcation is written by the heat transfer engineer specialistsin the Contractors’Mechanical Equipment Group. These speciﬁcations detail all ofthe pertinent aspects required in the manufacture of the equipment. It will encompassall of the requirements of the applicable.
Thermal rating
Reﬁnery process engineers are seldom if ever required to thermal rate a ﬁred heater or
indeed check the thermal rating. This is a procedure that falls in the realm of specialistmechanical engineers with extensive experience in heater design and fabrication.Process engineers are however required to specify the equipment so that it can bedesigned and installed to meet the requirements of the process heat balance. To do thiseffectively it is desirable to know something about the mechanism of heater thermalrating.
A ﬁred heater is essentially a heat exchanger in which most of the heat is transferred
by radiation instead of by convection and conduction. Rating involves a heat balancebetween the heat releasing and heat absorbing streams, and a rate relationship.1046 CHAPTER 18
Fuel is burned in a combustion chamber to produce a “ ﬂame burst” . The theoretical
ﬂame burst temperature may vary from 4,000◦F when burning reﬁnery gases with"
"20% excess air preheated to 460◦F , down to 2,300◦F when burning residual fuel oils
with 100% excess air at 60◦F . Heat is transferred from the ﬂame burst to the gases
in the ﬁrebox by radiation and mixing of the products of combustion. Heat is then
transferred from the ﬁrebox gases to the tubes mainly by radiation.
The common practice is to assume a single temperature for the ﬁrebox gases for the
purpose of radiation calculations. This temperature may be the same as the exit gastemperature from the ﬁrebox to the convection section (bridge wall temperature), orit may be different due to the shape of the heater and to the effect of convection heattransfer in the radiant section. Experience with the particular type of heater is requiredin order to select the effective ﬁrebox temperature accurately.
Whilst this chapter does not detail the rating procedure or give an example calculation
the following steps summarize the rating procedure:
1.0 Calculate net heat release and fuel quantity burned from the speciﬁed heat
absorption duty and an assumed or speciﬁed efﬁciency.
2.0 Select excess air percentage and determine ﬂue gas rates.3.0 Calculate duty in the radiant section by assuming 70% of total duty is radiant.
This is a typical ﬁgure and will be checked later in the calculations. For very highprocess temperatures, such as in steam-methane reforming heaters, the radiantduty may be as low as 45% of the total.
4.0 Calculate the average process ﬂuid temperature in the radiant section and add
100
◦F to get the tube wall temperature. The ﬁgure of 100◦F is usually a good ﬁrst
guess and can be checked later by using the calculated inside ﬁlm coefﬁcientand metal resistance.
5.0 Calculate the radiant surface area using the average allowable ﬂux. Convection
surface is usually about equal to the radiant surface.
6.0 Select a tube size and pass arrangement that will give the required total surface
and meet speciﬁed pressure drop limitations.
7.0 Select a center-to-center spacing for the tubes from the API 630 Standard or
from dimensions of standard ﬁttings, and calculate ﬁrebox dimensions. Longfurnaces minimize the number of return bends and thus reduce cost. Shorterand wider ﬁreboxes usually give more uniform heat distribution and lessen theprobability of ﬂame impingement on the tubes. For vertical cylindrical heaters,the ratio of radiant tube length to tube circle diameter should not exceed 2.7.
8.0 The remainder of the calculation involves determining the ﬁrebox exit temper-
ature from assumption (3) above, applying an experience factor for the typeof furnace to obtain the average ﬁrebox temperature, and then checking if thistemperature will transfer the required radiant heat.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1047
9.0 The average heat ﬂux (proportional to radiant surface) and the percent of total
duty of the radiant section (which affects average tube wall temperature) are
varied until a balance is obtained. The convection section surface and arrange-ment can now be calculated.
10.0 The heater is normally designed to allow adequate draft at the burners with
at least 125% of design heat release and an additional 10% excess air at themaximum and minimum ambient air temperatures.
Heat ﬂux
Although a process engineer is not normally required to thermally rate a process
heater he is often required to estimate the heater size, for preliminary cost estimatesor plot layout and the like. This can be accomplished quite simply by the use of “ HeatFlux” . Whilst this ﬁgure is quoted as Btu/hr sqft, it is not however an overall heattransfer coefﬁcient, it lacks the driving force /Delta1Tfor this. Heat ﬂux is the rate of heat
transmission through the tubes into the process ﬂuid.
The maximum ﬁlm temperature and tube metal temperature are a function of heat
ﬂux and the inside ﬁlm heat transfer coefﬁcient.
The heat ﬂux varies around the circumference of the tube, being a maximum on the
side facing the ﬁrebox. The value depends upon the sum of the heat received directlyfrom the ﬁrebox radiation and the heat re-radiated from the refractory.
Single ﬁred process heaters are usually speciﬁed for a maximum average heat ﬂux
of 10,000–12,000 Btu/hr sqft. The maximum point heat ﬂux is about 1.8 times grea-ter.
Double ﬁred heaters are usually speciﬁed for about 13,500 ×18,000 Btu/hr sqft
average heat ﬂux with the maximum point ﬂux being about 1.2 times greater.
The following are typical ﬂux values for heaters in hydrocarbon service:
Horizontal, ﬁred on one side 8,000–12,000
Vertical, ﬁred on one side from bottom 9,000–12,000
Vertical, single row, ﬁred on both sides 13,000–18,000
Heater efﬁciencyThe efﬁciency of a ﬁred heater is the ratio of the heat absorbed by the process ﬂuid
to the heat released by combustion of the fuel expressed as a percentage.1048 CHAPTER 18
Heat release may be based on the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel or higher"
"heating value (HHV). Process heaters are usually based on LHV and boilers on HHV .The HHV efﬁciency is lower than the LHV efﬁciency by the ratio of the two heatingvalues.
Heat is wasted from a ﬁred heater in two ways:
rwith the hot stack gas,
rby radiation and convection from the setting.
The major loss is by the heat contained in the stack gas. The temperature of the stack
gas is determined by the temperature of the incoming process ﬂuid unless an air pre-heater is used. The closest economical approach to process ﬂuid is about 100
◦F. I f
the major process stream is very hot at the inlet, it may be possible to ﬁnd a colderprocess stream to pass through the convection section to improve efﬁciency, providedplant control and ﬂexibility are adequately provided for. A more common method ofimproving efﬁciency is to generate and/or superheat steam and preheat boiler feedwater.
The lowest stack temperature that can be used is determined by the dew point of the
stack gases. See the section on stack emissions.
Figures 18.48 and 18.49 may be used to estimate ﬂue gas heat loss.The loss to ﬂue gas is expressed as a percentage of the total heat of combustion
available from the fuel. These ﬁgures also show the effect of excess air on efﬁciency.Typically excess air for efﬁciency guarantees is 20% when ﬁring fuel gas and 30%when ﬁring oil.
Heat loss from the setting, called radiation loss, is about 1
1/2to 2% of the heat re-
lease.The range of efﬁciencies is approximately as follows:
Very high — 90%+. Large boilers and process heaters with air pre-heaters.
High — 85%. Large heaters with low process inlet temperatures and/or air
pre-heaters.
Usual — 70–80%.
Low — 60% and less. All radiant.
Engineers are often required to check the efﬁciencies of the process heaters on oper-
ating units assigned to them. This can be done using the heats of combustion given inFigures 18.A.2 and 18.A.3 in the Appendix to this Chapter. The steps used to carryout these calculations are as follows:PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1049
Figure 18.48. Percentage of net heating values contained in ﬂue gas when ﬁring fuel gas.
Step 1. Obtain details of the heater from the manufacturer’ s data sheet or drawings.
The data required are:
rTube area
rLayout (is it vertical and how are the burners located?)
Step 2. From plant data obtain coil inlet and outlet temperature pressures and ﬂow.
Calculate the outlet ﬂash (i.e., vapor or liquid or a mixture of vapor and liquid)
condition, then calculate its enthalpy. Do the same for the inlet ﬂow. Usually thiswill be a single phase either liquid or vapor.
Step 3. Again from plant data obtain the quantity of fuel ﬁred and its properties (API
Gravity in particular).
Step 4. The difference between the enthalpies calculated in Step 2 is the enthalpy
absorbed by the feed in Btu per hour.1050 CHAPTER 18
Figure 18.49. Percentage of net heating values contained in ﬂue gas when ﬁring fuel oil.
Step 5. Divide this absorbed enthalpy by the tube area to give the heat ﬂux in Btu/hr/
ft2. Heat ﬂux’ s are generally as follows:
Horizontal, ﬁred one side 8,000 to 12,000 Btu/hr/ft2
Vertical, ﬁred from bottom on one side 9,000 to 12,000 Btu/hr/ft2
Vertical, single row, ﬁred on both sides 13,000 to 18,000 Btu/hr/ft2
If the heat ﬂux falls outside this range given above, there could be excessive fouling.
Check the pressure drop— if this is far above manufacturer’ s calculated value then
fouling is certainly present.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1051
Step 6. Check the thermal efﬁciency of the heater by giving the fuel ﬁred a heating
value. This is provided by ﬁgures in the appendix. Use the LHV (lower heating
valve) in Btu/lb and multiply it by the lbs/hr of the fuel.
Step 7. Divide the heat absorbed by the heat released calculated in Step 7 to give the
thermal efﬁciency. For most heaters this should be between 70% and 80%. If itfalls below this range note should be taken of burner operation and the amount ofexcess air being used.
Burners
The purpose of a burner is to mix fuel and air to ensure complete combustion. There
are about 12 basic burner designs. These are:
Direction — vertical up ﬁred
vertical down ﬁred
horizontally ﬁred
Capacity — high
low
Fuel type — gas
oilcombination
Flame shape — normal
slantthin, fan-shapedﬂatadaptable pattern
Hydrogen content — highExcess air — normal
low
Atomization — steam
mechanicalair assisted mechanical
Boiler typesLow NO
x
High intensity
Various combinations of the above types are available.
Gas burners
The two most common types of gas burners are the “ pre-mix”and the “ raw gas”
burners.1052 CHAPTER 18
Pre-mix burners are preferred because they have better “ linearity” , i.e., excess air
remains more nearly constant at turndown. With this type, most of the air is drawn"
"in through an adjustable “ air register” and mixes with the fuel in the furnace ﬁrebox.This is called secondary air. A small part of the air is drawn in through the “ primaryair register” and mixed with the fuel in a tube before it ﬂows into the furnace ﬁrebox.A turndown of 10:1 can be achieved with 25 psig hydrocarbon fuels. A more normalturndown is 3 : 1.
Oil burnersAn oil burner “ gun” consists of an inner tube through which the oil ﬂows and an outer
tube for the atomizing agent, usually steam. The oil sprays through an oriﬁce intoa mixing chamber. Steam also ﬂows through oriﬁces into the mixing chamber. Anoil-steam emulsion is formed in the mixing chamber and then ﬂows through oriﬁcesin the burner tip and then out into the furnace ﬁrebox. The tip, mixing chamber andinner and outer tubes can be disassembled for cleaning.
Oil pressure is normally about 140–150 psig at the burner, but can be lower or higher.
Lower pressure requires larger burner tips, the pressure of the available atomizingsteam may determine the oil pressure.
Atomizing steam should be at least 100 psig at the burner valve and at least 20–30
psi above the oil pressure. Atomizing steam consumption will be about 0.15–0.25 lbssteam/lb oil, but the steam lines should be sized for 0.5.
Combination burners
This type of burner will burn either gas or oil. It is better if they are not operated to
burn both fuels at the same time because the chemistry of gas combustion is differentfrom that of oil combustion. Gases burn by progressive oxidation and oils by cracking.If gas and oil are burned simultaneously in the same burner, the ﬂame volume willbe twice that of either fuel alone.
Pilots
Pilots are usually required on oil ﬁred heaters. Pilots are ﬁred with fuel gas.
Pilots are not required when heaters are gas ﬁred only, but minimum ﬂow bypasses
around the fuel gas control valves are used to prevent the automatic controls fromextinguishing burner ﬂames.
Excess air and burner operation
The excess air normally used in process ﬁred heaters is about 15–25% for gas burners
and about 30% for oil burners. These excess air rates permit a wide variation in heaterPROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1053
ﬁring rates which can be effectively controlled by automatic controls without fear of
‘ Starving’the heater of combustion air. There has been considerable work lately toreduce this excess air considerably mostly to minimize air pollution. This practice hasnot been used in process heaters to date. It has however been adopted in the operationof large power station type heaters with some success.
Normally companies specify that burners be sized to permit operation at up to 125% of
design heat release with a turndown ratio of 3 : 1. This gives a minimum controllablerate of 40% of design without having to shut down burners.
Burner control
Burner controls become very important from safety and operation considerations.Most systems include an instrumentation system with interlocks that prohibit:
rContinuing ﬁring when the process ﬂow in the heater coil fails
rThe ﬂow of fuel into the ﬁrebox on ﬂame failure
Under normal operating conditions the amount of fuel that is burnt is controlled byﬂow controllers operated on the coil outlet temperature. With combination burnersthe failure of one type of fuel automatically introduces the second type. Such a switchover can also be effected manually. This aspect is usually activated on pressure controlof the respective fuel system. That is, on low pressure being sensed on the fuel beingﬁred automatically switches to the second fuel.
Most companies operate their own speciﬁc controls for the heater ﬁring system.
Heater noise
All heaters are noisy and this noise is the result of several mechanisms. Among these
are the operation of the burners. Gas burners at critical ﬂow of fuel emit a noise. Thiscan be minimized by designing for low pressure drop in the system. Intake of primaryand secondary air is another source of noise. Forced draft burners are generally quieterthan natural draft if the air ducting is properly sized and insulated. The design of thefan can also reduce noise in this mechanism. Low tip speed fan favors low noiselevels.
Refractories, stacks, and stack emissions
Refractories are used on the inside walls of the heater ﬁre box, ﬂoor and through the
convection side of the heater. The purpose of this refractory lining is to conserve theheat by limiting its loss to atmosphere by convection. It is also necessary for personalsafety of those working on or about the heater who may accidentally touch the heaterwalls.1054 CHAPTER 18
Good insulation has the following qualities:
rIt has good high temperature strength
rIt is resistant to abrasion, spalling, chemical reaction, and slagging
rIt has good insulating properties
Among the most common refractories that meet some if not all of the above criteria"
"are silica refractories, high alumina and ﬁre clay brick. These have high resistance tospalling and to thermal shock. Their insulating qualities are also good.
Silica refractories tend to form slag with metal oxide dust and ashes. Compounds of
sodium and potassium attack most refractories while refractories containing magne-sium react with acids and acid gasses. Carbon monoxide and other reducing chemicalsthat may be present in the ﬁrebox reduce the life of refractories, particularly ﬁre claybrick and silica.
Dense refractories with low porosity are the strongest but have the poorest insulation
qualities. Castable refractories containing a mixture of cement and refractory aggre-gate are the cheapest and the easiest to install. They are not very rugged however.Normally in process heaters conditions are such that the use of a light insulatingrefractory will satisfy all that is required from a refractory lining.
The ASTM standard part 13 gives more detail on refractories. This standard provides
the classiﬁcation of refractories and describes their characteristics and composition.It also offers a procedure for calculating the heat loss through the insulation and thusits thickness.
Preparing refractories for operation
All new refractories need to be ‘ cured’after installation and before use. Refractories
contain moisture, some due to the installation procedure and some in the form of waterof crystallization. Curing the refractory means removing this moisture by applying aslow heating mechanism. New heater manufacturers will usually provide details ofthe curing procedure they recommend. The following procedure may however be usedas a guide to refractory curing when manufacturers’procedures are not available:
1.0 Rise temperature at 50
◦F per hour to a temperature of 400◦F and hold for 8 hr at
that temperature.
2.0 Then rise the temperature again at 50◦F per hour from 400◦F to 1,000◦F and hold
for another 8 hr.
3.0 If necessary continue heating at 100◦F per hr to the operating temperature if
higher than 1,000◦F . Hold at the operating temperature for a further 8 hrs.
4.0 Cool at 100◦F per hr to about 500◦F and hold ready for operation.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1055
5.0 On start up the heater can be heated up to its operating temperature at a rate of
100◦F per hr.
6.0 During the curing of the refractory it will be necessary to pass some ﬂuid through
the heater coils to protect them from overheating. Steam or air may be circulated
through the coils for this purpose. In certain cases such as in the catalytic re-forming of petroleum stock it may be necessary to circulate the nitrogen or thehydrogen that was used to purge and pressure test the unit. Air and steam in thisprocess would not be desirable.
Stacks
Stacks are used to create an updraft of air from the ﬁrebox of a heater. The purpose of
this is to cause a small negative pressure in the ﬁrebox and thus enable the introductionof air from the atmosphere. This negative pressure also allows for the removal of theproducts of combustion from the ﬁrebox. The stack therefore must have sufﬁcientheight to achieve these objectives and overcome the frictional pressure drop in theﬁrebox and the stack itself.
The height required for a stack to achieve good draft can be estimated from the
following equation:
D=0.187 H(ρ
a−ρg)
where
D=draft in ins of water.
H=Stack height in feet.
ρa=Density of atmospheric air in lbs/cuft.
ρg=Density of stack gasses in lbs/cuft at stack conditions.
For stack gas temperature use 100◦F lower than gasses leaving the convection section.
Stack gasses have a molecular weight close to that of nitrogen. For this calculationuse 28 as the mole weight. Burner draft requirements range from 0.2 to 0.5 ins ofwater. Use 0.3 ins of water as a good design value.
Stacks must also be designed to handle and disperse stack emissions. This usually
results in having to build stack heights greater than that required for obtaining draft.There are available speciﬁc computer programs relating plume height of the stackgasses above the stack outlet to the probable ground level fallout of the impurities inthe gas. These programs also produce a map of the relative concentrations of theseimpurities at ground level. Such data is usually available from government authorityofﬁces in most countries. The predicted ground concentration and map calculatedare checked against local legal requirements. The results usually form part of thegovernment approval to build and/or operate a facility.1056 CHAPTER 18
The stack diameter is based on an acceptable velocity of stack gasses in the stack.
This is generally taken as 30 ft/sec. Some allowance must be made for frictional lossesthese are:
1.5 velocity heads for inlet and outlet losses.
1.5 velocity head for damper.1.0 velocity head for each 50 ft of stack height.
Stack emissionsThe obnoxious compounds in stack gas emissions arise from:
rImpurities in the fuel
rChemical reactions resulting from the fuel combustion with air"
"The three major impurities in oil or gas fuels which produce undesirable emissions
are:
rSulfur
rMetals
rNitrogen
Sulfur
All gas and oil fuels contain sulfur at some level of concentration. When these fuels
are burned the sulfur reacts with air to form SO
2and SO 3. These compounds are
objectionable because they cause:
rAir pollution in the form of smog
rThey contribute to the corrosion of heater tubes and stack
rSO3lowers the dew point of the ﬂue gasses resulting in an objectionable visible
plume at the stack exit
Figure 18.50 shows the effect of sulfur in the feed on the ﬂue gas dew point. Thisdew point also of course varies with the amount of excess air and the relative partialpressure of the combustion gasses.
There is no precise way of determining the amount of SO
3that is formed in the ﬂue
gas. Nor can it be determined with any degree of accuracy where the SO 3is formed in
the system. The total amount of the sulfur oxides is of course determined simply from
the sulfur content of the feed. Because of this uncertainty it is important to restrict theminimum allowable convection side metal temperatures to 350
◦F when ﬁring fuels
containing sulfur. Also the minimum temperatures to the stack should be 320◦F when
ﬁring fuel gas and 400◦F when ﬁring fuel oil. In the case of metal stacks the use of
a non-corrosive lining must be used in the colder section of the stack if the ﬂue gastemperature falls below those stated above.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1057
Figure 18.50. Dew point of ﬂue gases versus sulfur content.
Metals
The most objectionable metal impurities in fuel oil are sodium and vanadium. These
can cause severe corrosion of tubes and refractory lining. By high vanadium contentis meant concentrations between 200 ppm and 400 ppm, above 400 ppm is consideredvery high and should not be used as a fuel. Vanadium in the presence of sodium andoxygen readily forms a corrosive compound:
Na
2O·6V2O5
This compound attacks iron or steel to form ferric oxides according to the equation:
Na2O·6V2O5+Fe−→ Na2OV 2O4·5V2O5+FeO1058 CHAPTER 18
This vanadium product is oxidized back to the original corrosive compound according
to the reaction:
Na2OV 2O4·5V2O5+Ox−→ Na2O·6V2O5
These reactions occur at temperatures between 1,070◦F and 1,220◦F with the vana-
dium compound being continually regenerated to its corrosive state.
Sodium and sulfur also combine to form undesirable corrosive compounds without
vanadium being present. This reaction forms sodium iron tri-sulfate Na 3Fe(SO 4)3
at temperatures of around 1,160◦F . The critical temperature for both vanadium and
sodium corrosion is around 1,100◦F . Vanadium is not a major problem at this tem-
perature but becomes so at temperatures above this level.
Nitrogen
Some nitrogen oxides will be formed in combustion gasses even if there are no
nitrogen compounds in the fuel. The presence of the nitrogen compounds in the fuelsigniﬁcantly increases the nitrogen oxide content of the ﬂue gas. There are six oxidesof nitrogen present in ﬂue gasses but only two are present in any appreciable amount.These are:
NO Nitrogen Oxide.
NO
2Nitrogen Dioxide.
Nitrogen oxide is a poisonous gas which readily oxidizes to nitrogen dioxide onentering the atmosphere. Nitrogen dioxide is a yellowish gas which readily combineswith the moisture in the air to form nitric acid. In the presence of sunlight and oxygennitrogen dioxide also contributes to the formation of other air pollutants collectivelylabeled NO
x. The production of NO xcan be reduced by limiting the amount of excess
air, by washing the ﬂue gasses with aqueous ammonia, or by catalytically reducingNO
xin the presence of ammonia.
Specifying a ﬁred heater
Some basic data concerning a ﬁred heater must be made known before the equipment
can be designed for fabrication or even costed. These data are provided by a speciﬁca-tion sheet or sheets. In the case of a ﬁred heater as in the case for compressors this speci-ﬁcation can run into several sheets or forms. Such sheets will deﬁne the unit in terms of:

Line 1. Design duty refers to the total duty required of the unit. In the case of the
example given here it includes the duty required to heat and partially vaporize the oil
in the radiant section and the duty required to superheat the steam. The data sheetwill be split into two sections to reﬂect each of these duties.
Service describes the main purpose for which the heater will be used. In this case it
will be used to heat and vaporize hydrocarbons.
Line 2. No of heaters. This is self explanatory. In this case there is only one heater
required. Should there have been more than one identical unit this would be reﬂected
here.1062 CHAPTER 18
Unit. This is the title given to this unit of equipment as it appears on an equipment
list. It will correspond to the item number also given in the equipment list. In the case
of the example it is “ Vac unit pre-heater.”
Line 3. Item No. This is the reference number given to the item in the equipment list.
This reference number and unit title identiﬁes the equipment on all drawings where
it appears, and all documents used in its purchase, costing, maintenance, etc.
Type. The type of heater (if decided on) is given here. In the case of the example heater"
"a cabin (Horizontal Tubes) type has been selected for vacuum services considerations.
Line 4. This is the ﬁrst line of the speciﬁcation sheet proper. It commences with
the service of the heater or section of the heater. In the case of this example only
two columns have been provided. These are designated for the ‘ Radiant’section and‘ Convection’section. On most preprinted speciﬁcation forms there would be at least4 columns.
Line 5. Heat absorption. This line divides the duty of the heater into that required
from the radiant coils and that required from the convection side. In this exam-
ple the oil is routed through the radiant section only while saturated steam from awaste heat boiler is superheated in the convection coils. Both are measured in millionBtu/hr.
Partial vaporization of the oil occurs in the radiant coil. Therefore a ﬂash curve or
a phase diagram of the oil must accompany this speciﬁcation sheet. In the examplethe duty to the oil is calculated from data developed in the material balance and heatbalance of the process. Thus:
Temperature of the feed into the heater is 554
◦F and that of the coil outlet is 750◦F.
From the ﬂash curve at the outlet pressure of 35 mm Hg abs (0.68 psia) and the
material balance the weight per hr of vapor is calculated to be 127,444 lbs/hr and theliquid portion is 69,641 lbs/hr. The heat absorbed in the radiant section is:
Heat in with feed =197,085 lbs/hr ×268 Btu/lb (all liquid)
=52.819 mm Btu/hr.
Heat out in feed:
Liquid portion =69,641 lbs/hr ×378 Btu/lb
=26.324 mm Btu/hr.
Vapor portion =127,444 lbs/hr ×510 Btu/llb
=64.996 mm Btu/hr.
Total heat out =91.320 mm Btu/hr.
Duty of radiant sect =91.320 −26.324
=38.501 mm Btu/hr.PROCESS EQUIPMENT IN PETROLEUM REFINING 1063
For the convection section the duty is calculated as follows:
Weight of saturated steam at 155 psig is 30,040 lbs/hr
Temperature of 155 psig steam =368◦F
From steam tables steam enthalpy =1,195.9 Btu/lb
Temperature of steam out =500◦F
Pressure of steam out =125 psig.
From steam tables steam enthalpy =1,275.3 Btu/lb.
Duty of convection side =30,040 (1,275.3 −1,195.9)
=2.385 mm Btu/hr.
Line 6. Fluid. This refers to the material ﬂowing in the coil. In the case of this example
it will be hydrocarbons in the radiant coil and steam in the convection coil.
Line 7. Flow rate. This is the total ﬂow rate in lbs per hour entering the respective
section of the heater. Thus for the radiant side the ﬁgure will be 197,085 lbs/hr, and
for the convection side it will be 30,040 lbs/hr.
Line 8. Allowable pressure drop. The process engineer enters the required pressure
drop calculated from the hydraulic analysis of the system. This pressure drop is
measured from the heater side of the inlet manifold down stream of the balancingcontrol valves and the coil outlet down stream of the outlet manifold.
Line 9. Allowable average ﬂux. This is usually a standard set by the company for its
various heaters. In the example here this value would be between 13,500 and 18,000
Btu/hr sqft. (a horizontal heater ﬁred on both sides). It is speciﬁed as 15,000 Btu/hrsqft for this example and refers only to the radiant section.
Line 10. Maximum inside ﬁlm temperature. It is important to notify the heater man-
ufacturer of any temperature constraint that is required by the process. In the case of
this example temperatures of the oil above 800
◦F may lead to the oil cracking. Such
a situation could adversely affect the performance of the downstream fractionationequipment and therefore high temperatures in excess of 800
◦F must be avoided. There
is no constraint on the convection coil.
Line 11. Fouling factor. The fouling factors used in heat exchanger rating can be used
here also. In this example therefore the radiant side would have a fouling factor of
about 0.004◦F sqft hr/Btu for the oil and 0.001 for the steam.
Line 12. Residence time. This becomes important when a chemical reaction of any
kind takes place in the heater tubes. In the case of this example this item does notapply. If the example were a thermal cracking heater or a visbreaker the appropriatekinetic equations and calculations would be attached to the speciﬁcation sheet tosupport this item.
Line 13–30. These are self explanatory. The only comment here is that the data are
quoted at the inlet or outlet conditions of temperature and pressure.1064 CHAPTER 18
Line 31. LHV . The section of the speciﬁcation sheet that follows deals with the
characteristics of the fuel that will be used in the heater. This section is divided into
oil and gas which are the usual fuels used in modern day processes. This item requiresthe “ Lower heating value” of the fuel. This can be read off charts such as Figures A9.2and A9.3.
Line 32. HHV . This is the other heating value data required by the heater designer.
This “ higher heating value” data can also be read off charts such as Figures A9.2 and
A9.3.
Line 33. Pressure at burner. This normally refers to the oil fuel and is measured at"
"the heater fuel oil manifold.Line 34. Temperature at the burner. This item too is self explanatory and these
measurements are also taken at the respective manifolds.Line 35. Mol wt of gas. This refers to the gas stream normally expected to be used.
Obviously in practice this will vary with the process operation from day to day.Line 36. Viscosity of the oil at the burner. This viscosity is quoted at the burner
temperature and may be arrived at from the two viscosity ﬁgures given later in the
speciﬁcation sheet. This is important for the best design or selection of the burneritself.
Line 37. Atomizing steam. This item calls for the temperature and pressure of the
steam that will be used for atomizing the oil fuel. This is also required for the best
design or selection of the oil burner.
Line 38. Composition of gas. This section requires the composition of the gas fuel
in terms of mol percent. This is the normal expected fuel gas that will be used in the
heater. If there is likely to be a wide variation in the quality of the fuel gas that willbe used this should be noted here as a range of two or even three compositions. Thissituation is particularly common in petroleum reﬁning.
Line 46. Properties of fuel oil. This ﬁnal section of the speciﬁcation sheet requires
details of the fuel oil that will be used. These details are:
Gravity of the oil @ 60
◦F (in◦API).
Viscosity of the oil @ 100◦F and at 210◦F
Flash point in◦F.
From the two viscosities the ‘ Refutus’ Graph can be used to determine the viscosity at
any other temperature. This graph can be found in most data books that carry viscositydata. Note the viscosity requested in this section is in centistokes (kinematic viscosity).This is because most suppliers quote in centistokes. To convert to centipoise multiplyby the speciﬁc gravity (grams/cm

The ﬂash point required is that determined by the Pensky Marten method and is a
measure of the oil’ s ﬂammability.
This completes the explanation of the main body of the speciﬁcation sheet. It rep-
resents the minimum data required to commence the sizing of the item. The lastpart of the speciﬁcation sheet is given to “ REMARKS” . In this section the engineer
should provide all the other data that may inﬂuence the design of the heater, e.g. Fig-ure 18.52.1066 CHAPTER 18

Abel ﬂash points
This is a test procedure for determining the ﬂash point of light distillate such as
kerosene. The ﬂash points determined by this method will be in the range of 85–120◦C."
"The apparatus consists of a water bath with a heating source into which is suspendeda cup containing the material to be tested. The water bath is heated and retained at aﬁxed temperature. The temperature of the sample being tested in the cup is measuredby a thermometer. The lid of the cup contains a shutter and a small gas burner fromwhich a ﬂame of determined length exits. The rate of temperature rise of the testmaterial is noted and at predetermined temperatures the shutter is opened and theburner ﬂame exposed to the space above the test liquid in the cup. The temperatureat which a ﬂame is observed crossing the surface of the oil sample when the burneris dipped into the cup is the ﬂash point. The ASTM name and number for this test isD56-01 Standard Test Method for Flash Point by Tag Closed Tester.
Absorption units
Absorption units usually consist of a trayed or packed tower in which a gas stream is
contacted with a lean solvent in a counter current ﬂow. Usually the gas stream entersbelow the bottom tray or packed bed and rises up the tower meeting the solvent liquidstream which enters the tower above the top tray or packed bed ﬂowing down the tower.Undesirable material in the gas stream is selectively absorbed into the liquid stream.This liquid stream then enters a stripping column (usually a Steam Stripper), wherethe absorbed material is stripped off and leaves as an overhead product. The strippedsolvent stream is then rerouted to the absorber tower to complete the cycle. Theseprocesses are used in petroleum reﬁning to remove heavy hydrocarbons from a light1072 CHAPTER 19

gas stream. More commonly this type of unit is used in gas treating for the removal
of H 2S from a gas stream (see Chapter 10 of this book). A schematic ﬂowsheet of an
absorption (gas treating unit) is shown as Figure 19.A.1.
Anhydrous hydro ﬂuoric acid
Anhydrous hydroﬂuoric acid (AHF) is a colorless, mobile liquid that boils at 67◦F
at atmospheric pressure, and therefore requires pressure containers. The acid is also
hygroscopic therefore its vapor combines with the moisture of air to form “ fumes” .
This tendency to fume provides users with a built-in detector of leaks in AHF storageand transfer equipment. On the other hand, care is needed to avoid accidental spillageof water into tanks containing AHF . Dilution is accompanied by a high release of heat.Hydroﬂuoric acid is very corrosive. It attacks glass, concrete, and some metals—especially cast iron and alloys that contain silica (e.g., Bessemer steels). The acid alsoattacks such organic materials such as leather, natural rubber, and wood, but does notpromote their combustion (see Chapter 15 for details).
Air condensers and coolers
Air cooling of process streams or condensing of process vapors is more widely used in
the process industry than cooling or condensing by exchange with cooling water. TheA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1073
Figure 19.A.2. A forced air ﬂow arrangement.
use of individual air coolers for process streams using modern design techniques has
economized in plant area required. It has also made obsolete those large cooling towersand ponds associated with product cooling. This item in Chapter 18 describes aircoolers in general and outlines a method to estimate surface area, motor horsepower,and plant area required by the unit.
As in the case for shell and tube exchangers there are many excellent computer
programs that can be used for the design of air coolers. The method given in Chapter 18for such calculation may be used in the absence of a computer program or for a goodestimate of a unit. The method also emphasizes the importance of the data suppliedto manufacturers for the correct speciﬁcation of the units.
Figures 19.A.2 and 19.A.3 show the two types of air coolers used in the process
industry. Both units consist of a bank of tubes through which the ﬂuid to be cooled orcondensed ﬂows. Air is passed around the tubes either by a fan located below the tubes
Figure 19.A.3. An induced air ﬂow arrangement.1074 CHAPTER 19
(Figure 19.A.2) forcing air through the tube bank or a fan located above the tube bank
drawing air through the tube bank (Figure 19.A.3). The ﬁrst arrangement is called‘ Forced draft’and the second ‘ Induced draft’ .
Air in both cases is motivated by a fan or fans driven by an electric motor or a
steam turbine or in some cases a gas turbine. The fan and prime driver are normallyconnected by a ‘ V’belt or by a shaft and gear box. Electric motor drives are by farthe most common prime drivers for air coolers.
The units may installed on a structure at grade or as is often the case on a structure
above an elevated pipe rack. Most air coolers in condensing service are elevate abovepipe racks to allow free ﬂow of condensate into a receiving drum.
Air systems
All chemical and petroleum plants require a supply of compressed air to operate the"
"plant and for plant maintenance. There are usually two separate systems and theseare:
rPlant air system
rInstrument air system
Plant air is generally supplied by a simple compressor with an after cooler. Veryoften when plant air is required only for maintenance this is furnished by a mobilecompressor connected to a distribution piping system. Air for catalyst regeneration andthe like is normally supplied by the regular gas compressor on the unit. Instrument airshould always be a separate supply system. Compressed air for instrument operationmust be free of oil and dry for the proper function of the instruments it supplies. Thisis a requirement which is not necessary for most plant air usage. A reliable sourceof clean dry instrument air is an essential requirement for plant operation. Failure ofthis system means a complete shut down of the plant.
Figure 13.36 in Chapter 13 of this Handbook shows a typical instrument air supply
system. Atmospheric air is introduced into the suction of one of two compressors viaan air ﬁlter. The compressors are usually reciprocating or screw type non-lubricating.Centrifugal type compressors have been used for this service when the demand forinstrument air is very high. The air compressors discharge the air at the requiredpressure (usually above 45 psig) into an air cooler before the air enters one of twodryers. One of the compressors is in operation while the other is on standby. Theoperating compressor is usually motor driven with a discharge pressure operatedon/off start up switch. The standby compressor is turbine (or diesel engine) drivenwith an automatic start up on low/low discharge pressure switch.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1075
The cooled compressed air leaves the cooler to enter the dryers. There are two dryer
vessels each containing a bed of desiccant material. This material is either silicagel (the most common), alumina, or in special cases zeolite (molecular sieve). Oneof the two dryers is in operation with the compressed air ﬂowing through it to bedried and to enter the instrument air receiver. The desiccant in the other dryer isbeing simultaneously regenerated. Regeneration of the desiccant bed is effected bypassing through the bed a stream of heated air and venting the stream to atmosphere.This heated stream removes the water from the desiccant to restore its hygroscopicproperties. At the end of this heating cycle cooled air is reintroduced to cool downthe bed to its operating temperature. When cool, the unit is then shut in ready to beswitched into operation for the ﬁrst dryer to start its regeneration cycle. The variousoperating and regeneration phases are automatically obtained by a series of solenoidvalves operated by a sequence timer switch control. These dryers (often including thecompressor and receiver items) are packaged units supplied, skid mounted, and readyfor operation.
The instrument air receiver vessel is a pressure vessel containing a crinkled wire
mesh screen (CWMS) before the outlet nozzle. It is high-pressure protected by apressure control valve venting to atmosphere, and of course is also protected by apressure safety valve. The air leaves the top of this vessel to enter the instrument airdistribution system servicing all the plants in the complex.

Shell, the Anglo Iranian Company, and Texaco in 1932–1936. Motor fuel alkylationin the petroleum reﬁning industry refers to the acid catalyzed conversion of C
3–C5
oleﬁns with isobutane into highly branched C 5–C12isoparafﬁns collectively called
alkylate, a valuable gasoline blending component. A major constituent of alkylate is2,2,4-trimethyl pentane which is deﬁned as 100 on the octane scale.
Alkylation reactions are catalyzed by liquid and solid acids, including H
2SO4, AlCl 3–
HCl, HF , HF–BF 3,H 2SO4–HSO 3F (ﬂuorosulfuric acid), triﬂuoromethane sulfonic
acid chlorided Pt alumina, BF 3on alumina, zeolites, and ion exchange resins. How-
ever, the catalysts and associated processes commercialized during World War II
for aviation gasoline, were HF alkylation and sulfuric acid alkylation. These are theprocess met with in most of today’ s reﬁneries (see Chapter 9 for a fuller historicaldescription).
The chemistry of the alkylation process is quite complex and is given in some detail
in Chapter 9 of this Handbook. Brieﬂy it can be summarized by the following reactionstages:1076 CHAPTER 19

"After pretreatment to remove H 2S and mercaptans the oleﬁn feeds are combined with
a large excess of recycle isobutane. This mixture provides an 6–14 isobutane/oleﬁn
molar ratio which is fed with a circulating HF acid catalyst to the shell side of a water-cooled reactor. The alkylation reaction is very fast with 100% oleﬁn conversion. Theexcess isobutane, alkylate product, non-reactive hydrocarbons (propane, n-butane)in the feeds and the acid catalyst pass on to the settler vessel. The dense acid phaseA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1077
separates from the hydrocarbons rapidly by gravity and is then pumped back to the
reactor. The hydrocarbons containing dissolved HF ﬂow off the top of the settler tothe isostripper. This is a large tower with two sidedraws. Its primary function is to pro-duce the recycling isobutane stream to maintain the high isobutane/oleﬁn molar ratioof the reactor feed. The tower typically has two reboilers. Alkylate is drawn off the bot-tom of the tower, cooled in exchangers, and sent to product storage. The next productdraw up the tower is the n-butane sidedraw and above that is the isobutane recycle draw.The isostripper overhead vapor is a propane-enriched isobutane stream and HF whichis condensed and separated in a settling drum. The HF phase is pumped back to thereactor section. The HF saturated hydrocarbon phase is charged to the depropanizer.
This tower and its associated HF stripper remove propane from the isobutane recycle.
The depropanizer bottoms is returned to the reactors as part of the recycle isobutane.The depropanizer overhead containing the propane product and HF are condensed andseparated in the overhead receiver. The acid phase is returned to the reactor sectionand the acid-saturated propane is stripped free of acid in the HF Stripper column. TheHF stripper bottoms is an acid-free propane product which is treated with hot aluminato remove organic ﬂuorides, cooled and treated with KOH pellets to remove traces ofHF and water.
The UOP HF Alkylation process contains an acid regenerator. This unit takes a small
sidestream of the recycle HF and strips out the acid leaving the hydrocarbon tojoin the isobutane recycle. (A full process description and discussion is given inChapter 9.)
Alkylation unit H
2SO 4
Figure 19.A.5 is a simpliﬁed process drawing of a H 2SO4alkylation unit. Today
there are two processes for H 2SO4alkylation, the cascade process licensed by Exxon
Mobil and MWKellogg and the Stratco efﬂuent refrigerated process. The one shown
as Figure 19.A.5 is the cascade process. Full details of this process and the Stratcoprocess are given in Chapter 14.
Amine solvents
Amines are used as solvents in the removal of hydrogen sulﬁde from reﬁnery gas
streams. There are many amine compounds used for this purpose. The more commonof these are listed as follows
rMonoethanol amine (MEA)
rDiethanol amine (DEA)
rDiglycol amine (DGA)1078 CHAPTER 19
Figure 19.A.5. H2SO4alkylation process.
There are also two proprietary processes licensed by Shell Petroleum which are used
extensively world wide. These are the ADIP process and the Sulﬁnol process.
Monoethanol amine
MEA is the most basic (and thus reactive) of the ethanol amines. MEA will completely
sweeten natural gases removing nearly all acid gases if desired. The process is wellproven in reﬁnery operations.
Like all of the amine solvents used for acid gas removal, MEA depends upon its amino
nitrogen group to react with the acidic CO
2and H 2S in performing its absorption.
MEA is considered a chemically stable compound. If there are no other chemicalspresent it will not suffer degradation or decomposition at temperatures up to its normalboiling point.
The process reactions are given below.

2RNH 2+H2S→(RNH3)2S
(RNH3)2S+H2S→2RNH 3HSA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1079
Some of the degradation products formed in these systems are highly corrosive.
They are usually removed by ﬁltration or reclaimer operations. Filtration will removecorrosive byproducts such as iron sulﬁde. Reclaiming is designed to remove heatstable salts formed by the irreversible reaction of MEA with COS, CS
2(Carbonyl
Sulﬁde and Carbon Disulphide). The reclaimer operates on a sidestream of 1–3% ofthe total MEA circulation. It is operated as a stream stripping kettle to boil waterand MEA overhead while retaining the higher boiling point heat stable salts. Whenthe kettle liquids become saturated at a constant boiling point with the degradationproducts it is shut in and dumped to the drain.
Diethanol amine
DEA does not degrade when contacted with CS
2, COS, and mercaptans as MEA
does. Because of this, DEA has been developed as a preferred solvent when these
chemicals are present in the stream to be treated.
DEA is a weaker base (less reactive) than MEA. This has allowed DEA to be circulated"
"at about twice the solution strength of MEA without corrosion problems. DEA systemsare commonly operated at strengths up to 30 wt% in water and it is not unusual tosee them as high as 35 wt%. This results in the DEA solution circulation rate usuallybeing a little less than MEA for the same system design parameters.
The process reactions are shown below.

2CH 2NHCH 2CH 2OH=R2NH=DEA

Because the system has much fewer corrosion problems and removes acid gases to
nearly pipeline speciﬁcations it has been installed as the predominant system in recentyears.
Diglycol amine
This process uses 2-(2-amono ethoxy) ethanol at a recommended solution strength of
60 wt% in water. DGA has almost the same molecular weight as DEA and reacts molefor mole with acid gases. DGA seems to tie up acid gases more effectively so thatthe higher concentration of acid gas per gallon of solution does not cause corrosionproblems as experienced with the usual amine processes.1080 CHAPTER 19

DGA does react with COS and mercaptans similarly to MEA but forms bis (hydroxy,
ethoxy ethyl) urea, BHEEU. BHEEU can only be detected using an infra-red testrather than chromatography. Normal operating levels of 2–4% BHEEU are carried inthe DGA without corrosion problems. BHEEU is removed by the use of a reclaimeridentical to that for an MEA system but operating at 385
◦F (196◦C). Materials of
construction are the same as those for MEA systems.
DGA allows H 2S removal to less than 1/4 grain per 100 Scf (about 0.006 kg per 1,000
cubic meters) and removes CO 2to levels of about 200 ppm using normal absorber
design parameters.A summary of these amines is given in Table 19.A.1.
Amine units
The use of chemically “ basic” liquids to react with the acidic gases was developed
in 1930. The chemical used initially was tri-ethanolamine (TEA). However as mono-ethanolamine (MEA) became commercially more available it became the preferredliquid reactant due to its high acid gas absorptivity on a unit basis.
Since 1955, numerous alternative processes to MEA have been developed. These have
fewer corrosion problems and are to a large extent more energy efﬁcient. Inhibitorsystems have however been developed which have eliminated much of the MEAcorrosion problems. Some of these newer processes also are designed to selectivelyremove the H
2S, leaving the CO 2to remain in the gas stream.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1081
A process diagram of a typical amine gas treating unit is given in Chapter 10 in of
this Handbook and is shown as Figure 19.A.1. A brief description of such a unit is asfollows:
Referring to the above ﬂow sheet, sour gas (rich in H
2S) enters the bottom of the
trayed absorber (or contactor). Lean amine is introduced at the top tray of the absorber
section to move down the column. Contact between the gas and amine liquid on thetrays results in the H
2S in the gas being absorbed into the amine. The sweet gas is
water washed to remove any entrained amine before leaving the top of the contactor.
Rich amine leaves the bottom of the contactor to enter a surge drum. If the contactor
pressure is high enough, a ﬂash stream of H 2S can be routed from the drum to a trayed
stripper. The liquid from the drum is preheated before entering a 20 tray strippingcolumn on the top tray. This stripper is re-boiled with 50 psig saturated steam. Hightemperatures cause amines to break down. The H
2S is stripped off and leaves the
reﬂux drum usually to a sulfur production plant. Sulfur is produced in this plant byburning H
2S with a controlled air stream, and then reacting H 2S with SO 2over a
catalyst.
The lean amine leaves the stripper and is cooled. The cooled stream is routed to the
contactor.
Amine absorber
Amine absorbers do not have a high-tray efﬁciency. Generally, the efﬁciency of a
contactor will range between 10% and 20%. This can be determined on an operatingplant using plant data to determine the number of theoretical trays required to achievethe plant’ s operating performance. There are several accepted methods to calculatetheoretical trays in this service. Among these are the MCabe Thiele graphical Methodand the calculation method described by the following equation. This later calculationmethod is considered by many to be the sounder and more accurate of the methodsavailable. The equation used for determining the theoretical trays for the absorptionprocess is as follows:

Note: The above equations are suitable for all absorbents.
The Tower: The conventional Amine Contactor is divided into two parts:
The Absorption Section
The Water wash section
This is shown in Figure 19.A.6.The lean amine enters the tower above the top absorber tray, through a distributor. It
ﬂows down the absorber section trays counter current to the rich gas moving up thetower. The rich gas enters the tower via a distributor under the bottom absorber tray. TheH
2S contained in the gas is absorbed by the amine solvent by mass transfer on the trays.
The rich amine leaves the bottom of the tower to the amine stripper column. The leangas leaves the top of the of the absorber section to enter the water wash section of thetower. This wash section contains about 4–5 trays or a packed bed. Water is introducedabove the top wash tray and ﬂows down counter current to the lean gas to remove anyentrained amine in the gas. The water is collected in a chimney tray and pumped tothe oily water sewer. The washed gas leaves the top of the tower into the gas system.
Anhydrous ammonia
Ammonia is used in the reﬁnery to neutralize vapor containing HCL at the overhead
section of the atmospheric crude distillation tower. The ammonia is injected into thevapor spaces above the top four (or ﬁve) trays of the tower and into the overheadvapor line. The ammonia may be in the anhydrous form and introduced directly fromcylinders or may be in the form of an aqueous solution. The aqueous form is injectedfrom a storage bullet by means of metering pumps.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1083

API codes
API stands for the American Petroleum Institute. The purpose of this body is to
provide the industry with a set of standards which deﬁnes the design and measurementparameters that will be used in the petroleum industry. These codes cover such itemsas: vessel design, oily water separators, boiler design, safety items etc, and a numberof laboratory test procedures for feed and petroleum products.1084 CHAPTER 19
API gravity
This item is used in the compilation of most crude assays (see Chapter 1 of this
Handbook). Although not a laboratory test as such it is derived from the standard testto determine the speciﬁc gravity of a liquid. The correlation between speciﬁc gravityand degrees API is as follows:
Sp Gr =141.5
131.5+◦API
The speciﬁc gravity and the API are at 60◦F . Note API is always quoted in degrees.
Aromatics
Aromatics are present throughout the entire boiling range of crude oil above the
boiling point of benzene, the compound with the lowest boiling point in the homo-logue. These compounds consist of one or more closed conjugated rings with oneor more alkyl groups attached. The lighter aromatics such as benzene, toluene, andthe xylenes are removed as products in the petroleum chemical plants (see Chapter12 of this Handbook). In the energy petroleum reﬁnery these lighter aromatics areincluded in the ﬁnished gasoline products to enhance the octane rating of the prod-ucts. Indeed the reﬁnery process of catalytic reforming is aimed at converting thelower octane compounds (predominately naphthenes) into the high octane light aro-matics. The heavier aromatic compounds however are often undesirable compoundsin many products, such as kerosene, jet fuel, and many lube oils. In these cases thearomatic compounds are either converted (de-aromatizing hydrotreater for kerosenes)or removed by solvent extraction as in the case of lube oils.
The production of benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and the xylenes in the petro-
chemical reﬁnery commences with the catalytic reforming of the naphtha productproduced in the normal energy reﬁnery. This reformate is treated to remove the residualaliphatic compounds of the naphtha by solvent extraction. The rich aromatic streamis then subjected to a series of distillation processes and selective con version tomaximize the BTX products required. A typical conﬁguration for an aromatic complexis shown in Figure 19.A.7.
This is one of many conﬁgurations for aromatic production. In Figure 19.A.7, the
production maximizes benzene and ortho xylene at the expense of some toluene andall of ethyl benzene. This is accomplished by a cryogenic de-alkylation unit to producemore benzene, and a catalytic isomerization unit to convert ethyl benzene to orthoxylene.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1085

"Ash content (Petroleum)
Petroleum ash content is the non-combustible residue of a lubricating or fuel oil
determined in accordance with ASTM D582— also D874 (sulfated ash).
ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers)
The American Society of Mechanical Engineers has been a world leader in codes,
standards, accreditation, and certiﬁcation for over a century. These programs havenow been extended to include the registration (certiﬁcation) of quality systems inconformance with the standards set by the International Organization of Standardiza-tion (ISO). In the petroleum industry, this organization sets the quality requirementsfor vessel fabrication, piping and in particular the boiler code among many otherstandard deﬁnitions.
Asphalt
Asphalt is a group of products produced from the vacuum distillation residue of crude
oil. The products that make up this group have distinct properties that must be metby the treating of the vacuum residue.
There are two major categories of asphalt products. These are:
rPaving and Liquid Asphalt
rRooﬁng Asphalt
The paving grades will have a penetration speciﬁcation of 300 (30.0 mm) or less
@7 7
◦F and 100 g weight, while the softer liquid grades will have a penetration of
300 and higher.
The liquid asphalt grades are typiﬁed as, RC (rapid curing), MC (medium curing), and
SC (slow curing) each of these grades will also have 4 viscosity grades as given below:1086 CHAPTER 19
70 grade— RC/MC/SC 70–140 Cs @ 140◦F.
250 grade— RC/MC/SC 250–500 Cs
800 grade— RC/MC/SC 800–1,600 Cs3,000 grade— RC/MC/SC 3,000–6,000 Cs.
Rapid curing cutbacks are penetration asphalt and naphtha blends having a viscosity
range from 75 SSF @ 77
◦F to 600 SSF @ 180◦F . The naphtha content may be as high
as 75 vol%. Cutbacks are hot sprayed onto existing roads as a binding medium for
new wearing surfaces.
Medium curing cutbacks are penetration grade asphalt and kerosene blends with four
grades having the same viscosities as the RC cutbacks. These are used in road building
in the same way as the RC cutbacks.
Slow curing cutbacks are penetration asphalt and gas oil blends normally produced
directly from the crude oil atmospheric or vacuum distillation. The volume produced
is small and they are used mainly as a gravel dust layer or mixed with aggregates forcold patching of asphalt surfaces.
Rooﬁng asphalt
The second largest asphalt use is that for rooﬁng. Most of these asphalts are pro-
duced by air blowing. There are three major rooﬁng grades and may be classiﬁed bypenetration and softening points. These are:
P e n@7 7
◦F Softening point◦F
Type 1 25–50 140–150Type 2 20–30 166–175Type 3 15–25 190–205
Type 1 grade is used on ‘ Dead Flat’roof while the other two are used on intermediate
and steep slope roofs, respectively.
Asphalt blowing process
Blowing air into a vessel containing asphalt from vacuum distillation or the de asphalt-
ing process will change its penetration and softening properties. Among the variablesthat affect the manufacture of air blown asphalt are:
rThe rate of the air injected
rThe temperature of the asphalt
rRetention time of the asphalt
rThe system pressureA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1087
Description and details of this process are given in Chapter 12 in of this
Handbook.
Asphaltenes
Asphalt is basically a colloidal dispersion of asphaltenes in oil with resins as the
stabilizing agent. The quantities of these can vary widely with the type of crude.
Asphaltenes can be hydrogenated to resins, resins to oils. Resins can be oxidized to
asphaltenes, oil to resins. Thus:
Asphaltenes +H2/arrowsoutheastH2→Oil
+
Resins
+
Asphaltenes +O2/arrownorthwestO2+Oil
Oxidation is really a misnomer, as air blown asphalt has essentially the same oxygencontent as the charge. Air blowing asphalt increases the asphaltene content, hardens it,decreases penetration, increases softening, and reduces ductility. Basically air blowingis a polymerization process following the route below:
1. Addition of O
2to form unstable compounds from which H 2O is eliminated leaving
unsaturated compounds which polymerize.
2. Addition of O 2to form carboxyl derivatives from which CO 2is eliminated followed
again by polymerization.
3. Formation and elimination of volatile oxidation products other than H 2O and CO 2
followed again by polymerization.
It is worth noting, that the best crudes for asphalt air blowing are those with high
percentage of asphaltene fraction and low in parafﬁn hydrocarbons, and waxes. Resinscan be oxidized to asphaltenes relatively easily, so crudes rich in resin are good rawmaterials for asphalt manufacture. Oils can also be oxidized to asphaltenes, but theymust be oxidized to resins ﬁrst, which requires a more severe operation. Crackedresidua simply do not make good asphalt.
Assay: The crude
The crude oil assay is a compilation of laboratory and pilot plant data that deﬁne"
"the properties of the speciﬁc crude oil. At a minimum, the assay should contain adistillation curve for the crude and a speciﬁc gravity curve. Most assays howevercontain data on pour point (ﬂowing criteria), sulfur content, viscosity, and many otherproperties. The assay is usually prepared by the company selling the crude oil, it is used1088 CHAPTER 19
extensively by reﬁners in their plant operation, development of product schedules, and
examination of future processing ventures. Engineering companies use the assay datain preparing the process design of petroleum plants they are bidding on, or havingbeen awarded the project, they are now building.
The data normally contained in a well produced assay will be:
rA TBP curve
rA speciﬁc gravity curve
rA sulfur content curve
rA pour point and cloud point curve
rProduct tables of some of the lighter products. These should contain at least the
following:
➢The product boiling range
➢The product yield on crude
➢The cuts gravity (usually in
◦API)
➢A PONA (parafﬁn, oleﬁn, naphthene, and aromatic content)
➢In the case of the naphthas the cuts octane values
➢In the case of kerosene cuts, their sulfur and smoke point data
➢In the case of diesel and gas oil cuts their diesel index or cetane value

Atmospheric crude distillation unit
History of the processThe distilling of petroleum products from crude oil to some extent or other has long
been practiced. Certainly, the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans had some formof extracting a ﬂammable oil from, probably, weathered crude oil seepage. It wasn’ tthough until the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth century that crude oil welldrilling was ﬁrst discovered and commercialized. Originally the crude oil was reﬁnedto produce essentially Kerosene (Lamp Oil), and a form of gasoline known then asbenzene (as opposed to benzene already being produced from coal) and the residueused as pitch for calking and sealing. The lamp oil or kerosene was produced toprovide a means of illumination, later a lighter cut known as Naphtha was producedfor the same purpose but used in special pressurized lamps.
The production of these early distillates was by made by cascading the crude oil
through successive stills each operating at successively higher temperatures. This isshown in diagram Figure 19.A.8. This is described more fully in Chapter 3 of thisHandbook.
Figure 19.A.8. Schematic of a continuous atmospheric crude still.1090 CHAPTER 19
Figure 19.A.9. A Typical atmospheric crude distillation unit.
The major breakthrough in this process was the development of the single fractionating
column. This came in the late 1920s and 1930s. In many reﬁneries however, even insome modern ones built after say 1960, the atmospheric crude unit contains a primaryfractionator which removes the light ends and some naphtha, before the main tower.These cases are rare and are only used when the crude feed contains a great deal oflight ends (spiled crude) or a primary tower is added to increase throughput.
The process
Crude oil is pumped from storage to be heated by exchanges against hot overhead and
product streams in the crude unit. At a temperature of about 200–250
◦F , the crude
enters the desalter. Free salt water contained in the crude is washed out and separatedby means of an electrostatic precipitator contained in the desalter drum. The waterphase from the drum is sent to a sour water stripper to be cleaned before disposal tothe oily water sewer.
The oil phase is further heated by exchange with hot sidestream and bottom products
before entering a ﬁred heater. The crude oil is heated in the heater to a temperaturethat will vaporize the distillate products in the crude tower. Some additional heat isA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1091"
"added to the crude to vaporize about 5% more than required for the distillate streams.
This is called overﬂash and is used to ensure good reﬂux streams in the tower.
The un-vaporized portion of the crude leaves the bottom of the tower via a steam
stripper section as the bottom product. The distillate vapors move up the tower countercurrent to the cooler liquid reﬂux streams coming down. Heat and mass transfer takeplace on the trays contained in the tower. Distillate products are removed from thevarious sections of the tower, they are stream stripped and sent to storage. The fullnaphtha vapor is allowed to leave the top of the tower to be condensed and collected inthe overhead drum. A portion of this stream is returned as reﬂux while the remainderis delivered to the light end processes for stabilizing and further distillation.
The side-stream distillates shown in Figure 19.A.9 above are:
rHeavy Gas Oil (has the highest Boiling Point)
rLight Gas Oil (will become Diesel)
rKerosene (will become Jet Fuel)
A“Pump around”section is included at the light gas oil draw-off. This is simply
an internal condenser which takes heat out of that section of the tower. This in turn
ensures a continued reﬂux stream ﬂow below that section.
B
Barrels
In the petroleum industry, the barrel is a standard form of measuring liquid volume.
A barrel of oil is deﬁned as 42 U.S. gallons (one U.S. gallon equals 231 cubic inches).It is still used extensively in most countries, but is being replaced particularly inEuropean countries by the metric measures of cubic meters or liters, or by weightmeasures like kg or tonnes (1000 kg).
BPCD and BPSD
BPCD is the measure of throughput or stream ﬂow based on an operation over one
year of 365 days. BPSD is the rated throughput of a plant or the rate of a stream overthe total operating days in the year. BPCD is barrels per calendar day, and BPSD isbarrels per stream day. BPSD is deﬁned as BPCD divided by the service factor as afraction. The service factor is the percentage time over a calendar year that the unit isoperating. Each type of unit is allocated a service factor depending on the amount ofscheduled shut down time the particular unit requires over the year for maintenance.The following is an example of some service factors:1092 CHAPTER 19
Unit Service Factor Percent
Crude distillation unit 95–98
Light ends distillation 98Vacuum crude distillation 95–98Visbreaker and thermal cracker 90Cat reformer 90–92
Naphtha hydrotreaters 90–92Gas oil hydrotreaters 90
Fluid catalytic crackers 85–90Hydrocrackers (distillate feed) 90Hydrocrackers (residue feed) 80–82 ( includes residue hydrotreating)Cokers 85
These service factors are based on modern day plant operating controls and state ofthe art catalyst quality and regenerating frequency.
Base lube oils
This refers to a lube product that meets all lube speciﬁcations and is suitable for
blending to meet performance speciﬁcations.
Bitumen
Bitumen is the term often given to untreated asphalt from the vacuum distillation of
crude and the extract from the de-asphalting unit. This is before the stream has beentreated, with cut backs or by air blowing to make the various asphalt product grades.
Boiling points and boiling range
It is not possible to separate the components of crude oil into individual chemical
compounds. However groups of these component mixtures are grouped together andidentiﬁed by the boiling point at atmospheric pressure of the lightest component inthe group and the boiling point of the heaviest component in the group. The groupitself is called a Cutand the range of temperatures that identify it is called the boiling
range or cut range. These can be related to the crude TBP curve to determine its yieldon that particular crude (see Chapter 1 of this Handbook).
Bright stocks (lube oils)
These are processed from the rafﬁnate of the vacuum residue de-asphalting unit.

Burners
The purpose of a burner is to mix fuel and air to ensure complete combustion. There
are about 12 basic burner designs. These are:
Direction — vertical up ﬁred
vertical down ﬁred
horizontally ﬁred
Capacity — high
low
Fuel type — gas
oilcombination
Flame shape — normal
slantthin, fan-shapedﬂatadaptable pattern
Hydrogen content — highExcess air — normal
low
Atomization — steam
mechanicalair assisted mechanical
Boiler typesLow NO
x
High intensity
Various combinations of the above types are available.
Gas burners
The two most common types of gas burners are the “ pre-mix”and the “ raw gas”
burners.Pre-mix burners are preferred because they have better “ linearity” , i.e., excess air
remains more nearly constant at turndown. With this type, most of the air is drawn
in through an adjustable “ air register” and mixes with the fuel in the furnace ﬁrebox.This is called secondary air. A small part of the air is drawn in through the “ primary1096 CHAPTER 19
air register” and mixed with the fuel in a tube before it ﬂows into the furnace ﬁrebox.
A turndown of 10 : 1 can be achieved with 25 psig hydrocarbon fuels. A more normalturndown is 3 : 1.
Oil burnersAn oil burner “ gun” consists of an inner tube through which the oil ﬂows and an outer
tube for the atomizing agent, usually steam. The oil sprays through an oriﬁce intoa mixing chamber. Steam also ﬂows through oriﬁces into the mixing chamber. Anoil-steam emulsion is formed in the mixing chamber and then ﬂows through oriﬁcesin the burner tip and then out into the furnace ﬁrebox. The tip, mixing chamber andinner and outer tubes can be disassembled for cleaning.
Oil pressure is normally about 140–150 psig at the burner, but can be lower or higher.
Lower pressure requires larger burner tips, the pressure of the available atomizingsteam may determine the oil pressure.
Atomizing steam should be at least 100 psig at the burner valve and at least 20–30 psi
above the oil pressure. Atomizing steam consumption will be about 0.15–0.25 lbssteam/lb oil, but the steam lines should be sized for 0.5.
Combination burnersThis type of burner will burn either gas or oil. It is better if they are not operated to
burn both fuels at the same time because the chemistry of gas combustion is differentfrom that of oil combustion. Gases burn by progressive oxidation and oils by cracking.If gas and oil are burned simultaneously in the same burner, the ﬂame volume willbe twice that of either fuel alone.
PilotsPilots are usually required on oil ﬁred heaters. Pilots are ﬁred with fuel gas.Pilots are not required when heaters are gas ﬁred only, but minimum ﬂow bypasses
around the fuel gas control valves are used to prevent the automatic controls fromextinguishing burner ﬂames.
Excess air and burner operationThe excess air normally used in process ﬁred heaters are about 15–25% for gas burners
and about 30% for oil burners. These excess air rates permit a wide variation in heaterﬁring rates which can be effectively controlled by automatic controls without fear of‘ Starving’the heater of combustion air. There has been considerable work lately toA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1097
reduce this excess air considerably mostly to minimize air pollution. This practice has
not been used in process heaters to date. It has however been adopted in the operationof large power station type heaters with some success.
Normally, companies specify that burners be sized to permit operation at up to 125% of"
"design heat release with a turndown ratio of 3 : 1. This gives a minimum controllablerate of 40% of design without having to shut down burners.
Burner control
Burner controls become very important from safety and operation considerations.
Most systems include an instrumentation system with interlocks that prohibit:
rContinuing ﬁring when the process ﬂow in the heater coil fails
rThe ﬂow of fuel into the ﬁrebox on ﬂame failure
Under normal operating conditions the amount of fuel that is burnt is controlled byﬂow controllers operated on the coil outlet temperature. With combination burnersthe failure of one type of fuel automatically introduces the second type. Such a switchover can also be affected manually. This aspect is usually activated on pressure controlof the respective the fuel system. That is on low pressure being sensed on the fuelbeing ﬁred automatically switches to the second fuel.
(See Chapter 18 for more details on burners and heaters.)
Heater noise
All heaters are noisy and this noise is the result of several mechanisms. Among these
are the operation of the burners. Gas burners at critical ﬂow of fuel emit a noise. Thiscan be minimized by designing for low pressure drop in the system. Intake of primaryand secondary air is another source of noise. Forced draft burners are generally quieterthan natural draft if the air ducting is properly sized and insulated. The design of thefan can also reduce noise in this mechanism. Low tip speed fan favors low noiselevels.
C
Catalytic reforming unit
History. Without doubt, the development of catalytic reforming was a major evolution
of the petroleum reﬁning industry. It, in fact signiﬁed the birth of the ‘ Hydroskimming1098 CHAPTER 19
Reﬁnery’ . The process produces hydrogen as a by-product in the upgrading of the
naphtha octane value, and this hydrogen provided the means to upgrade a number ofproducts by hydro treating.
Catalysts had been used during World War II for the upgrading of aviation fuels in
terms of their octane number. Catalytic reforming of a kind had also been developedfrom a coal usage plant to process the aromatics used for war time explosives, etc. Itwas in the late 1950s and early 1960s that the ﬁxed bed of bi-metallic catalyst wasﬁrst developed. This process accomplished what the modern day catalytic reformersdo in converting the cycloparafﬁns to their corresponding aromatics with the releaseof hydrogen molecules.
The process. Catalytic reforming is a process for improving the octane quality of
straight-run naphthas and of mixed naphthas containing cracked naphtha. The princi-
pal reaction is dehydrogenation of naphthenes to aromatics. Contributing to the highoctane of the product are side reactions such as hydrocracking of high-boiling hydro-carbons to low-molecular weight parafﬁns, isomerization of parafﬁns to branched-chain structures, and dehydrocyclization of parafﬁns and oleﬁns to aromatics.Hydrogen recycle reduces the formation of carbon. Figure 19.C.1 is a process sketchof a typical catalytic reformer.
Figure 19.C.1. A typical catalytic reforming unit.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1099
Feedstocks preferably are within the 200–430◦F (TBP) boiling range. Feeds with
lower initial boiling-point contain C 5naphthenes which do not aromatize well. Feeds
with higher ﬁnal boiling point:
(a) Cause excessive lay-down of carbon on catalyst.
(b) Necessitate product re-running because reforming may increase the ﬁnal boiling-
point beyond gasoline speciﬁcation.
The water content of the feedstock must be under 10 ppm to prevent rapid stripping
of chloride from the platinum catalyst. Poisoning of the platinum catalyst is preventedby hydroﬁning the feed to a sulfur content below 10 ppm. Recycle hydrogen is addedto the reformer feed and the mixture is preheated and charged to the ﬁrst of a seriesof reactors. As the reactions are highly endothermic, each reactor efﬂuent is reheatedbefore being charged to the following reactor.
The efﬂuent from the ﬁnal reactor is separated into hydrogen rich gas and reformate.
With heavy feeds, the reformate may contain 430
◦F+polymer.
The catalyst, 0.6 wt% platinum and 0.6 wt% chloride on alumina base, is regenerable.The type of regeneration system and the cycle length between regeneration periodsdepends on feed quality and reforming severity. Good feedstock quality and reformingseverity favor the use of the semi-regeneration system, in which the plant is shutdown after three months of operation to regenerate all reactors simultaneously. Whenreforming poorer feed and/or going into higher octane, the cyclic regenerative systemis used in which there is a spare or “ swing”reactor. A deactivated reactor can beregenerated in one day without process interruption. Many units now operate at highseverity with continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR). Further details at this processare given in Chapter 5.
Centrifugal compressors
Compressors are divided into four general types, these are:
rCentrifugal
rAxial"
"rReciprocating
rRotary
This item refers only to the centrifugal compressor a description of which now follows.This type of compressor consists of an impeller or impellers rotating at high speed
within a casing. Flow is continuous and inlet and discharge valves are not requiredas part of the compression machinery. Block valves are required for isolation duringmaintenance.1100 CHAPTER 19
Centrifugal compressors are widely used in the petroleum, gas, and chemical indus-
tries primarily due to the large volumes of gas that frequently have to be handled.Long continuous operating periods without an overhaul make centrifugal compres-sors desirable for use in petroleum reﬁning and natural gas applications. Normallythey are considered for all services where the gas rates are continuous and above 400ACFM (actual cubic feet per minute) for a clean gas, and 500 ACFM for a dirty gas.These rates are measured at the discharge conditions of the compressor. Dirty gasesare considered to be gases similar to those from a catalytic cracker, which may containsome ﬁne particles of solid or liquid material.
The slowly rising head capacity performance curves make centrifugal compressors
easy to control by either suction throttling or variable speed operation.
The main disadvantage of this type of compressor is that it is very sensitive to gas
density, molecular weight, and polytropic compression exponent. A decrease in den-sity or molecular weight results in an increase in the polytropic head requirement ofthe compressor to develop the required compression ratio.
The ﬂow range of centrifugal compressors is as shown in Table 19.C.1.In general, the head or differential pressure levels served by centrifugal compressors
is considerably lower than that for reciprocal. The following diagram illustrates thisfeature (Figure 19.C.2).
Surge. A characteristic peculiar to centrifugal and axial compressors is a minimum
capacity at which the compressor operation is stable. This minimum capacity is re-
ferred to as the surge or pumping point. At surge, the compressor does not meet thepressure of the system into which it is discharging. This causes a cycle of ﬂow reversalas the compressor alternately delivers gas and the system returns it.

Figure 19.C.2. Comparison of differential compressor heads.
The surge point of a compressor is nearly independent of its speed. It depends largely
on the number of wheels or impellers in series in each stage of compression. Reason-able reductions in capacity to specify for a compressor are shown in Table 19.C.2.
An automatic re-circulation bypass is required on most compressors to maintain the
minimum ﬂow rates shown. These are required during start-up or when the normalload falls below the surge point. Cooling is required in the recycle circuit if thedischarge gas is returned to the compressor suction.
Performance curves for centrifugal compressors
The rise of performance curves should be speciﬁed for a compressor. This is normally
done by specifying the pressure ratio rise to surge required in each stage of compres-sion. A continuously rising curve from normal ﬂow rate to surge ﬂow is required forstable control.

The pressure ratio rise to surge is largely a function of the number of impellers per
compression stage. Reasonable pressure ratio rises to specify are shown below:
Wheels/compression Minimum % of rise in pressure

Frequently, the performance curves for a compressor have to be plotted to determine if
all anticipated process operations will ﬁt the compressor and its speciﬁc speed control.Three points on the head capacity curve are always known. These are the normal, surge,and maximum capacity points. The normal capacity is always considered to be onthe 100% speed curve of the compressor. The surge point and the compression ratiorise to surge have been speciﬁed. From this the head produced by the compressor atthe surge point can be back-calculated using the head-pressure ratio relationship. Themaximum capacity point is speciﬁed to be at least 115% of capacity at 85% of normalhead.
The head capacity curve retains its characteristic shape with changes in speed. Curves
at other speeds can be obtained from the three known points on the 100% speed curveby using the following relationships:
1. The polytropic head varies directly as the speed squared."
"2. The capacity varies directly as speed.3. The efﬁciency remains constant.
Figure 19.C.3 below shows a typical centrifugal compressor performance curve.
Cloud points
The cloud point of a transparent or semi transparent oil sample is the temperature
at which a cloud or mist forms in the sample. The method is ASTM D 2500, andis carried out in the laboratory where a sample of the oil is reduced in temperatureby submerging the sample in its container ﬁrst in ice then in iced salt and ﬁnally ina solid CO
2bath. The container is a cylindrical glass vessel about 19 mm diameter
by 100 mm deep. The vessel is ﬁlled to a mark about 80 mm deep and a low rangethermometer inserted so the bulb is about 10–12 mm below the sample surface.Temperature readings are taken at every stage. Readings are more frequently takenin the last cooling stage and that temperature at which the sample becomes misty istaken as its cloud point.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1103

Coke
Coke is formed in the processes to convert the residuum fuels to the more desirable
distillate products of naphtha and lighter through to the middle distillates. By farthe largest production of coke is the sponge coke from the delayed coking process.Uncalcined sponge coke has a heating value of about 14,000 Btu/lb and is usedprimarily as a fuel. High sulfur sponge coke however is popular for use in cementplants since the sulfur reacts to form sulfates. Sponge coke is calcined to produce acoke grade suitable for anodes in the aluminum industry.1104 CHAPTER 19
Figure 19.C.4. A delayed coker.
Coking processes
Coke is formed in the processes to convert the residuum fuels to the more desirable
distillate products of naphtha and lighter through to the middle distillates. There aretwo routes by which this coking process proceeds. The ﬁrst and the most common is thedelayed coking route. The second is the ﬂuid coking method, and this has been mademore attractive to many reﬁners with the development of ExxonMobil’ s proprietaryprocess of Flexicoking. This proprietary process eliminates the coke completely by
converting it to low Btu fuel gas (see Chapter 11).
The delayed coking process
The delayed coking process is illustrated in Figure 19.C.4.The fuel oil or heavy oil feed is routed to a cracking furnace similar to other thermal
cracking processes. The efﬂuent from the furnace is sent to one of a set of severalcoking drums without quenching. The efﬂuent is normally at a coil outlet temperatureof around 920
◦F and at a pressure of 30–50 psig and the coking drum is ﬁlled in about
24 hr. The vapors leaving the top of the drum whilst ﬁlling are routed to the fractionator,where they are fractionated to the distillate products. The very long residence periodof the efﬂuent in the coking drums results in the complete destruction of the heavyfractions, and a solid residue rich in carbon is left in the drum as coke. When thedrum is full of coke it is cooled and the top and bottom of the drum are opened.Special high-pressure water jets are used to cut and remove the coke through thedrum’ s bottom opening.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1105
Figure 19.C.5. A ﬂexi (ﬂuid) coking process.
Flexi coking (Fluid coker)
Flexi-coking is a thermal conversion process licensed by Exxon Research and Engi-
neering Company. The process itself is an extension of the traditional ﬂuid cokingprocess. The extension allows for the gasiﬁcation of the major portion of the cokemake to produce a low-Btu gas. The gasiﬁcation step follows closely to the conceptused in the coal gasiﬁcation processes.
Figure 19.C.5 is a simpliﬁed ﬂow diagram of the Flexi-coking process.Heavy residuum feed is introduced into the reactor vessel where it is thermally cracked.
The heat for cracking is supplied by a ﬂuidized bed of hot coke transferred to thereactor from the heater vessel.
The vapor products of the reaction leave the reactor zone to enter the scrubber section.
Fine coke and some of the heavy oil particles are removed from the cracked productsin the scrubber zone and returned to mix with the fresh feed entering the reactor. Thereactor products subsequently leave the scrubber and are routed to a conventionalfractionating facility. Steam is introduced to the bottom of the reactor to maintain a1106 CHAPTER 19
ﬂuid bed of coke and to strip the excess coke leaving the reactor free from entrained
oil. The coke leaving the reactor enters the heater vessel, where sufﬁcient coke isconverted into CO/CO
2in the presence of air. This conversion of the coke provides"
"the heat for cracking which is subsequently transmitted to the reactor by a hot cokestream. The net coke make leaves the heater and enters the gasiﬁer vessel. Air andsteam are introduced into the gasiﬁer to react with the coke producing a low-Btugas consisting predominately of hydrogen, CO, CO
2, and nitrogen. This gas together
with some excess air is transferred to the heater, and leaves this vessel to be suitablycleaned and cooled.
Flexi-coking is an extinctive process. By continuous recycle of heavy oil stream all the
feed is converted into distillate fractions, reﬁnery gas, and low Btu gas. There is a verysmall coke purge stream which amounts to about 0.4–0.8 wt% of fresh feed. Whensuitably hydrotreated, the fractionated streams from the Flexi-coker provide goodquality products. Hydrotreated coker naphtha provides an excellent high naphthenefeed to the catalytic reformer.
Cold ﬂash separator
In many high temperature and high pressure hydrocracker or hydrotreater units the
reactor efﬂuent is reduced in pressure and temperature in several stages. The last ofthese stages is the cold ﬂash separation stage. Figure 19.C.6 shows a typical residuumhydrocracker with a cold ﬂash separator.
The reactor efﬂuent leaves the reactor to enter a hot ﬂash drum which is near to the
reactor pressure and temperature conditions. Here the heavy bituminous portion ofthe efﬂuent leaves from the bottom of the drum while the lighter oil and gas phaseleaves as a vapor from the top of the drum. This vapor is subsequently cooled by heatexchange with the feed and further cooled and partially condensed by an air cooler.This cooled stream then enters a cold separator operating at a pressure only slightlylower than that of the reactor. A rich hydrogen gas stream is removed from this drum tobe amine treated and returned as recycle gas to the process. The distillate liquid leavesfrom the bottom of the separator to join a vapor stream from the hot ﬂash surge drum(in this case a thermal cracker feed surge drum). Both these streams enter the cold
ﬂash drum which operates at a much lower pressure than the upstream equipment.
A gas stream is removed from the drum to be routed to the absorber in a light ends unit.The liquid distillate from the drum is routed to the debutanizer in the light ends unit.

pseudo components (see Chapter 1 for deﬁnition of pseudo components and mid-
boiling points). The purpose of component balances is to calculate more accuratelyfractions of the feed material properties in terms of speciﬁc gravity, sulfur content,mole weight, cloud and pour points and the like. Figure 19.C.7 shows a hypotheticalTBP curve of a middle distillate fraction. This fraction has been broken up into6 pseudo components, with mid boiling points of 410
◦–591◦F . By referencing the
crude feed assay from which this fraction originates, the SG of each component canbe read off as
◦API. If it is a well-produced assay the component sulfur, cloud and
pour points can also be read off for each pseudo component. The volume of eachpseudo component forming the fraction is shown as the ‘ x’of the TBP curve.
Some of the components shown in the diagram are tabled in order to determine thefraction’ s properties. Table 19.C.3 is an example of the purpose of the componentbreakdown In this case only the speciﬁc gravity is determined, but by applying therespective assay data for other properties a reasonable deﬁnition of the fraction canbe obtained (see Chapter 1).
Condensers (shell and tube)
In the chemical process plants vapors are condensed either on the shell side of a shell
and tube exchanger, the tube side of an air cooler, or by direct contact with the coolant1108 CHAPTER 19

in a packed tower. By far the most common of these operations are the ﬁrst two
listed. In the case of the shell and tube condenser, the condensation may be producedby cooling the vapor by heat exchange with a cold process stream or by water. Aircooling has overtaken the shell and tube condenser in the case of water as coolant inpopularity as described in item 6.4.
In the design or performance analysis of condensers the procedure for determining
thermal rating and surface area is more complex than that for a single phase coolingand heating. In condensers there are three mechanisms to be considered for the ratingprocedure. These are:A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1109"

Each of these mechanisms is treated separately and along pre-selected sections of the

Enthalpy curves are given as the heat content per lb or per hour contained in the mixed
phase condensing ﬂuid plotted against temperature. An example of such a curve isgiven in Figure 19.C.8. These Enthalpy curves are developed from the vapor/liquidor ﬂash calculations described in Chapter 1 and 3.
Brieﬂy, the calculation for the curve commences with determining the dew point of
the vapor and the bubble point of the condensate. Three or more temperatures areselected between the dew and bubble points and the V/L calculation of the ﬂuid atthese temperatures carried out. Enthalpy for the vapor phase and the liquid phase areadded for each composition of the phases at the selected temperatures. These togetherwith the enthalpy at dew point and bubble point are then plotted.
A manual calculation for condensers is described here. Again this is done to provide
some understanding of the data required to size such a unit and its signiﬁcance inthe calculation procedure. Computer aided designs should however be used for thesecalculations whenever possible.
The following calculation steps describe a method for calculating the ﬁlm coefﬁcient
of a vapor condensing on the shell side of a S&T exchanger. The complete ratingcalculation will not be described here as much of the remaining calculation is simplyrepetitive.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1111
Step 1. Calculate the dew point of the vapor stream at its source pressure. Estimate
the pressure drop across the system. Usually 3–5 psi will account for piping and
the exchanger pressure drop. Calculate the bubble point of the condensate at theterminal pressure. Select three or more temperatures between dew point and bubblepoint and calculate the vapor/liquid quantities at these conditions of temperatureand pressure.
Step 2. Calculate the enthalpy of the vapor and liquid at these temperatures. Plot the
total enthalpies against temperature to construct the enthalpy curve. Establish theproperties of the vapor phase and liquid phase for each temperature interval.The properties mostly required are speciﬁc gravity, viscosity, Mole wt, thermalconductivity and speciﬁc heats.
Step 3. In the case of a water cooler calculate the duty of the exchanger and the
quantity of water in lbs/hr. Commence the heat transfer calculation by assuming anoverall heat transfer coefﬁcient, calculating the corrected LMTD, and the surfacearea.
Step 4. Using the surface area calculated in Step 3 deﬁne the exchanger geometry in
terms of number of tube passes, number of tubes on the center line, shell diameter,bafﬂe arrangement and the shell free ﬂow area. Calculate also the water ﬂow infeet per sec.
Step 5. Divide the exchanger into 3 or 4 zones by selecting the zone temperatures on
the enthalpy curve. Calculate the average weight of vapor and the average weight ofcondensate in each zone. Using these averages calculate the average heat transferredfor:
Cooling of the vapor Q

Step 6. Calculate the ﬁlm coefﬁcient for the tube side ﬂuid.
Step 7. Starting with zone 1 and knowing the outlet temperature of the coolant ﬂuid,"
"the total heat duty of the zone, and the shell side temperatures calculate the coolantinlet temperature. Using this calculate the LMTD for the zone and, assuming azone overall heat transfer coefﬁcient U, calculate a surface area for the zone. Usingthis and the total exchanger area estimated in Step 4 establish L

Step 8. Calculate the condensing ﬁlm coefﬁcient from the equation given earlier. This
will be an uncorrected value for hc. This will be corrected to account for turbulence
by the expression.
hc (corr)=hc×(Gv/5)0.7
where

Control valves
Control valves are used throughout the process and oil reﬁning industries to control
operating parameters. These parameters are:
rFlow
rPressure
rTemperature
rLevel
Figure 19.C.9 shows the conventional control valve which in this case is taken as adouble seated plug type valve. Like most control valves it is operated pneumatically byan air stream exerting a pressure on a diaphragm which in turn allows the movementof a spring loaded valve stem. One or two plugs (the diagram shows two) are attachedto the bottom of the valve stem which, when closed, ﬁt into valve seats thus providingtight shut off. The progressive opening and closing of the plugs on the valve seatsdue to the movement of the stem, determines the amount of the controlled ﬂuidﬂowing across the valve. The pressure of the air to the diaphragm controlling thestem movement is varied by a control parameter, such as a temperature measurement,or ﬂow measurement, or the like.
There are two types of plug valves used for the conventional control valve function.
These are:
rSingle seated valves
rDouble seated valves1114 CHAPTER 19

The Conventional Control Valve
Figure 19.C.9. A doubled seated control valve.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1115
Single seated valves are inherently unbalanced so that the pressure drop across the
plug affects the force required to operate the valve. Double seated valves are inherentlybalanced valves and are the ﬁrst choice in most services.
There are two other types of control valves in common service in the industry. These
are the Venturi Type and the Butterﬂy type. Both these types when pneumaticallyoperated (which they usually are) work in the same way as described above for a plugtype valve. The major difference in these two types are in the valve system itself. Inthe case of the venturi the ﬂuid being controlled is subjected to a 90
◦angle change
in direction within the valve body. The inlet and outlet dimensions are also different,with the inlet having the larger diameter. The valve itself is plug type but seats in thebend of the valve body.
Venturi type or angle valves are used in cases where there exists a high-pressure"
"differential between the ﬂuid at the inlet side of the valve and that required at theoutlet side. Details of these valves may be found in Chapter 13 of this book.
Butterﬂy valves operate at very low-pressure drop across them. They can operate
quite effectively at only ins of water gauge pressure drop, and where the operation ofthe conventional plug type valves would be unstable. The action of this valve is bymeans of a Flap in the process line. The movement of this ﬂap from open to shut ismade by a valve stem outside the body itself. This stem movement, as in the case ofthe other pneumatically operated valves, is provided by air and spring loads onto thestem from a diaphragm chamber. The only major disadvantage in this type of valveis the fact that very tight shut off is difﬁcult to obtain due to the ﬂap type action ofthe valve. Details of valve characteristics and valve sizing are given in Chapter 13 ofthis book.
Cost estimating
Details of cost estimating as it applies to process plants including oil reﬁneries are
given in Chapter 17 of this book. The following is a synopsis of the cost estimatesections of Chapter 17.
The progress of any construction or development project in a reﬁnery uses milestone
cost estimates coupled with completion schedules for its measurement and control.In the life of a construction project therefore about four “ control estimates” may bedeveloped. For want of better terms these may be referred to as:
rThe Capacity Factored Estimate
rThe Equipment Factored Estimate
rThe Semi Deﬁnitive Estimate
rThe Deﬁnitive Estimate1116 CHAPTER 19
These are described brieﬂy as follows:
The capacity factored estimate
In most process studies this is the ﬁrst estimate to be prepared. It is the one that
requires the minimum amount of engineering but is the least accurate. This is becausethe plant that is used to factor from will not exactly match the plant in question. It isgood enough however when comparing different processes where the estimates areon the same basis. Past installed costs of similar plants (Deﬁnitive Estimate) are usedcoupled with some experienced factors to arrive at this type of estimate. The cost ofa higher or lower capacity plant is obtained from the equation:
C=K(A/B)
b
where
C=Cost of the plant in question.
K=Known cost of a similar plant of size B.
A=Is the capacity of the plant in question.(usually in vol/unit time).
B=Capacity of known plant.
b=Is an exponential factor ranging between 0.5 and 0.8.
The equipment factored estimate
This estimate requires a substantial amount of process engineering to deﬁne the
speciﬁc plant or process that is to be estimated. Details of the degree of engineeringthat is to be performed is given in item 8.4. Brieﬂy the following process activity isrequired:
rDevelopment of a ﬁrm Heat and Material Balance
rAn acceptable Process ﬂowsheet to be developed
rAn Approved Equipment list
rEquipment summary Process Data sheet for all major equipment
rProcess Speciﬁcation for Specialty Items
A detailed narrative giving a process description and discussion (This will be requiredfor the management review and approval of the estimate).
The semi deﬁnitive and the deﬁnitive cost estimates
These estimates will include input from all engineering disciplines that are involved
in the engineering and construction of the plant or process. Although major manufac-turing companies such as large oil companies and chemical companies have sufﬁcientstatistical data to develop semi deﬁnitive and deﬁnitive estimates these are normallyleft to the engineering and construction companies.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1117
Figure 19.C.10. Time phasing of estimates.
These companies develop the estimates and use them during the course of the instal-
lation project as cost control tools for project management.
Phasing of the estimates
The phasing of the estimates in the project schedule is reﬂected in Figure 19.C.10.
The estimates are as follows:
A) Capacity Factored
B) Machinery and EquipmentC) Semi Deﬁnitive
D) Deﬁnitive
Crude oil
Crude oil is a mixture of hydrocarbon compounds. These compounds range in boiling
points and molecular weights from methane as the lightest compound to those whosemolecular weight will be in excess of 500. Chapter 1 of this book describes thesehydrocarbon families in some detail. Brieﬂy the major groups are:

Figure 19.C.11. Graph of cumulative cash ﬂow."
"In addition to these basic compounds there will be impurities. The major non-
hydrocarbon impurity are the sulfur compounds. In the lighter boiling range of thecrude oil sulfur appears mostly in the form of mercaptans, while in the higher boilingpoint section of the crude the sulfur is in the form of complex thiophenes. In additionto sulfur, nitrogen, and heavy metal are usually present in small quantities, but aresufﬁcient to cause problems to some processes. Oleﬁns are usually present in smallquantities in the crude oil, but are produced in the processes of reﬁning the crude.Most notably are the thermal and ﬂuid catalytic process that produce oleﬁns.
The nature and the properties of crude oil vary considerably. This variation is usually
connected to the area from which the crude oil is produced. The properties of crudeoils from respective sources are recorded in the Crude Assay which is produced bythe vendors of the individual crude oils.
Summary assays of the more common crude oils are produced as Appendix 3 to this
part of the book.
Cumulative cash ﬂow and present worth
There are several methods of assessing proﬁtability based on discounted cash ﬂow
(DCF), but the most reliable yard stick is a return on investment method using thePresent Worth (or Net Present Value) concept. This concept equates the present valueof a future cash ﬂow as a product of the present interest value factor and the futurecash ﬂow. Based on this concept, the Return on Investment is that Interest value orA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1119

Discount Factor which forces the Cumulative Present Worth value to Zero over the
economic life of the project.
The calculation itself is in two parts, which are:
rCalculation of Cash Flow
rPresent Worth Calculation
Both these calculations are described in detail in Chapter 17 of this book. The phases
and summary of Cumulated Cash Flow is provided by Figure 19.C.11.
The calculation for present worth is iterative, and is fully explained in Chapter 17
with an example calculation.
Cut points
A cut point is deﬁned as that temperature on the whole crude TBP curve that represents
the limits (upper and lower) of a fraction to be produced. Consider the curve shownin Figure 19.C.12. Below of a typical Crude oil TBP curve.
A fraction with an upper cut point of 100
◦F produces a yield of 20 vol% of the whole
crude as that fraction. The next adjacent fraction has a lower cut point of 100◦F and
an upper one of 200◦F this represents a yield of 50–20% =30 vol% on crude.

De-aromatization processThe de-aromatization process is a hydrotreating process that converts aromatic com-
pounds to naphthenes and parafﬁns. Its most common use is to lower the smoke1120 CHAPTER 19

point of kerosene, particularly if the product is to be blended to make aviation tur-
bine gasoline. Initially the reduction of kerosene smoke point was effected by theremoval of aromatic compounds by extraction using liquid SO
2. A typical kerosene
de-aromatizing unit is shown as Figure 19.D.1.
De-sulfurized kerosene feed is introduced and preheated with hot reactor efﬂuent.
Hydrogen make-up and the hydrogen recycle stream are mixed with the preheated feedto enter the reactor heater which rises the feed temperature to reaction temperature.Leaving the heater the feed enters the top catalyst bed of the reactor. It ﬂows downthrough the bed consisting of a nickel type catalyst. The reaction is exothermal andtemperature is controlled by an inter-cooler between the top bed and a second catalystbed. Steam is generated in the inter-cooler as the cooling medium. The reactor efﬂuentleaves the second catalyst bed to be condensed by heat exchange with incoming feed,and, if necessary, by a trim air cooler. This condensate enters a separator drum thepressure of which is set to remove a light hydrocarbon and hydrogen stream at atemperature of 100
◦F . The pressure in this drum also determines the reactor pressure
and, depending on the catalyst used, will be between 350 and 450 psig. The liquidfrom the separator will be stripped free of light ends in a conventional trayed andreboiled stripper column. The purity of the hydrogen recycle stream is maintainedby removing a purge stream that reduces the total hydrocarbons in the recycle. Therecovery of kerosene product by this process is between 85% and 90% volume.
De-asphalting process
De-asphalting the heavy end of crude, that is the vacuum residue, is not entirely re-"
"served for the production of lube oils. In energy reﬁneries it is used to remove theasphaltene portion of the residue to prepare a suitable feedstock for catalytic conver-sion units. In most of these conversion units the performance of the catalyst is greatlyA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1121
impaired by the presence of heavy metals and the high Conradson carbon content of
the residue feed. Most of the metals are entrained in the asphaltene compounds whichmake up most of the asphalt portion of the residue. These asphaltenes are also high inConradson carbon content, so the removal of these serves to eliminate both the heavymetal content and the high Conradson Carbon. In the case of lube oil production,the light liquid phase resulting from the extraction of the asphalt makes excellentlube base oil. This de-asphalted oil is termed ‘ Bright Stock’and can now be furtherreﬁned in the same way as neutral base stock, which are vacuum distillates, to meetthe speciﬁcations for blend stocks. Details of the process are given in Chapter 12 ofthis book.
De-butanizer
De-butanizers are used in reﬁneries to remove butanes and lighter compounds from
product streams. The most notable of the feed streams is the overhead distillate fromthe atmospheric crude distillation tower. Other uses of this process are in the removalof these light ends from hydrotreaters (kero & heavier products), and the reactorefﬂuent liquids from catalytic reforming and hydrocracking. The overhead from theﬂuid catalytic cracker main tower is also debutanized, but the butane compounds fromthis process will also contain the oleﬁnic compounds from the cracking process. Atypical process conﬁguration for a debutanizer is shown below as Figure 19.D.2.
The debutanizer operates at an overhead accumulator pressure of about 125 psia
at 100
◦F . Usually the whole column overhead is condensed under these conditions

unless there is hydrogen present. Thus, in the case of hydotreaters, reformers, and
hydrocrackers there will be partial condensation and there will be a vapor phase fromthe drum as well as the liquid distillate. The tower will consist of between 30 and 35distillation trays and the external reﬂux will be about 2 : 1. More details and designprocedures are given in Chapter 4 of this Handbook.
De-ethanizer
The purpose of the de-ethanizer is to remove ethane from the product stream of LPG.
Normally it will be the last tower in a light end distillation conﬁguration (see the item‘ Light End Distillation’ under ‘ Distillation’ in this Part 2 of the book. The de-ethanizertower operates at an overhead accumulator of below 450 psia at 100
◦F . This ensures
that the operating pressure at the bottom of the tower, which is propane LPG, will bebelow its critical pressure. In the design example given in Chapter 4 the pressure inthe accumulator was calculated to be 350 psia at 100
◦F , and this was the dew point of
the overhead vapor product. De-ethanizers operating without overhead refrigerationfacilities have partial condensers and in this case only sufﬁcient overheads from thetower are condensed to meet the reﬂux required in the tower. Thus the accumulatorbecomes a theoretical tray itself and there will be no liquid distillate product assuch.
De-propanizer
In the reﬁnery conﬁguration of light ends distillation this unit is usually located
between the de-butanizer and the de-ethanizer. The process ﬂow is similar to the de-butanizer, with total overhead product and reﬂux being condensed. The tower operatesat a reﬂux drum pressure of between 200 and 250 psia at 100
◦F . The tower contains
35–40 actual trays, and the bottom product will be butane LPG. The overhead distillatewill be feed to the de-ethanizer whose bottom product will be propane LPG.
Dew points
Is the temperature and pressure condition at which a hydrocarbon vapor begins to
condense. That is in a calculation the sum of the mole fraction composition of thevapor divided by the equilibrium constant of each compound must equal the sum of thesum of the mole fraction of the liquid phase at the dew point condition of temperatureand pressure. The following example illustrates this concept. (This example is basedon a tower top condition for an atmospheric crude distillation unit.)
The following dew point calculation will be carried out at 8.3 psia which is the partial
pressure of the hydrocarbons in the overhead vapor.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1123

the process does reduce pour and cloud points to some extent), and blended with
kerosene and some heavier middle distillate stock to meet the diesel oil speciﬁcation.A summarized speciﬁcation is given below as Table 19.D.1.
Because diesel oil is a motive fuel and therefore emissions are in direct contact
with the general public, extensive emission controls are in place. These include thecomposition of the fuel itself and the engine design in which it is used. Full detailsof these controls are described and discussed in Chapters 2 and 16 of this book.
Distillate hydro cracking
Hydrocracking is a versatile catalytic reﬁning process that upgrades petroleum feed-
stocks by adding hydrogen, removing impurities, and cracking to a desired boilingrange. Hydrocracking requires the conversion of a variety of types of molecules and ischaracterized by the fact that the products are of signiﬁcantly lower molecular weightthan the feed. Hydrocracking feeds can range from heavy vacuum gas oils and cokergas oils to atmospheric gas oils. Products usually range from heavy diesel to lightnaphtha.
While the ﬁrst commercial installation of a unit employing the type of technology
in use today was started up in Chevron’ s Richmond, California, reﬁnery in 1960,hydrocracking is one of the oldest hydrocarbon conversion processes. Hydrocrackingtechnology for coal conversion was developed in Germany as early as 1915 designedto secure a supply of liquid fuels derived from domestic deposits of coal. The ﬁrstA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1125
plant for hydrogenation of brown coal was put on stream in Leuna, Germany, in 1927,
applying what may be considered the ﬁrst commercial hydrocracking process.
In the mid-1950s the automobile industry started the manufacture of high-
performance cars with high-compression ratio engines that required high-octane gaso-line. Thus catalytic cracking expanded rapidly and generated, in addition to gasoline,large quantities of refractory cycle stock that was a material that was difﬁcult to con-vert to gasoline and lighter products. This need to convert refractory stock to qualitygasoline was ﬁlled by hydrocracking. Furthermore, the switch of railroads from steamto diesel engines after World War II and the introduction of commercial jet aircraft inthe late 1950s increased the demand for diesel fuel and jet fuel. The ﬂexibility of thenewly developed hydrocracking processes made possible the production of such fu-els from heavier feedstocks. The early hydrocrackers used amorphous silica aluminacatalysts. The rapid growth of hydrocracking in the 1960s was accompanied by the de-velopment of new, zeolite based hydrocracking catalysts. They showed a signiﬁcantimprovement in certain performance characteristics as compared with amorphouscatalysts: higher activity, better ammonia tolerance, and higher gasoline selectivity.
There are several process ﬂow schemes for the Hydrocracker process. These are"
"discussed in Chapter 7. The following recycle ﬂow scheme is one of the more commonﬂow conﬁguration (Figure 19.D.3).
Hydrocracking reactions proceed through a bifunctional mechanism. A bifunctional
mechanism is one that requires two distinct types of catalytic sites to catalyze sepa-rate steps in the reaction sequence. These two functions are the acid function, which

provide for the cracking and isomerization and the metal function, which provide for
the oleﬁn formation and hydrogenation. The cracking reaction requires heat while thehydrogenation reaction generates heat. Overall, there is heat release in hydrocracking,and just like in treating, it is a function of the hydrogen consumption (the higher theconsumption, the more important the exotherm). Generally, the hydrogen consump-tion in hydrocracking (including the pre-treating section) is 1,200–2,400 SCFB/wt%change (200–420 Nm
3/m3/wt% change) resulting in a typical heat release of 50–100
Btu/Scf H 2(2.1–4.2 kcal/m3H2) which translates into a temperature increase of about
0.065◦F/Scf H 2consumed (0.006◦C/Nm3/m3H2). This includes the heat release gen-
erated in the treating section. In general, the hydrocracking reaction starts with thegeneration of an oleﬁn or cycleoleﬁn on a metal site on the catalyst. Next, an acid siteadds a proton to the oleﬁn or cyclo-oleﬁn to produce a carbenium ion. The carbeniumion cracks to a smaller carbenium ion and a smaller oleﬁn. These products are theprimary hydrocracking products. These primary products can react further to producestill smaller secondary hydrocracking products. Some of these reactions are given inFigure 19.D.4.

Distillation
Part 1: Laboratory distillation tests
rThe ASTM distillation curve. While the TBP curve is not produced on a routine basis
the ASTM distillation curves are. Rarely however is an ASTM curve conducted on
the whole crude. This type of distillation curve is used however on a routine basis forplant and product quality control. This test is carried out on crude oil fractions usinga simple apparatus designed to boil the test liquid and to condense the vapors asthey are produced. Vapor temperatures are noted as the distillation proceeds and areplotted against the distillate recovered. Because only one equilibrium stage is usedand no reﬂux is returned, the separation of components is poor and mixtures aredistilled. Thus the initial boiling point for ASTM is higher than the correspondingTBP point and the ﬁnal boiling point of the ASTM is lower than that for the TBPcurve. There is a correlation between the ASTM and the TBP curve, and this isdealt with later in Chapter 1 of this Handbook.
rThe true boiling point curve (TBP). This is a plot of the boiling points of almost
pure components, contained in the crude oil or fractions of the crude oil. In earliertimes this curve was produced in the laboratory using complex batch distillationapparatus of a hundred or more equilibrium stages and a very high reﬂux ratio.Nowadays this curve is produced by mass spectrometry techniques much quickerand more accurate than by batch distillation.
rThe equilibrium vaporization curve (EFV). The EFV curve of an oil is determinedin a laboratory using an apparatus that conﬁnes liquid and vapor together until therequired degree of vaporization is achieved. The percentage vaporized is plottedagainst temperature for several runs to produce the EFV curve. Separation is poorerfor this type of distillation than for an ASTM or TBP . Therefore the initial boilingpoint will be higher for the EFV than for the ASTM. The ﬁnal boiling point of theEFV will be lower than that for the ASTM. This test is rarely done but the EFVcurve is calculated either from a TBP curve or an ASTM curve. These methods aregiven in Chapters 1 and 3.
Part 2: The distillation processes
Next to heat exchange the unit operation of distillation is the most utilized operation in
oil reﬁning. The separation of products by distillation fall into three major categories.These are:
rTotal vapor condensation such as the atmospheric crude distillation
rVacuum distillation processes. Such as the vacuum distillation of atmosphericresidue
rLight ends distillation1128 CHAPTER 19"
"rTotal vapor condensation processes. The best example of this type of distillation
units in modern reﬁning is the atmospheric crude distillation unit. In these type of
units the feed is heated and vaporized to a temperature above the total product cutpoint. This mixed vapor/liquid is produced by an external heater (and heat exchangersystem) and the mixed stream ﬂashed in the lower section of a tower. The vaporrises in the tower and condensed by cooled reﬂux stream at various stages up thetower according to the various distillate boiling points. Full details of this type ofdistillation is given in Chapter 3 of this book. Similar distillation systems are alsoused in the primary separation of Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit efﬂuent, and thereactor efﬂuent from hydrocrackers.
rV acuum distillation processes. These processes are designed to operate as total
vapor condensation similar to the atmospheric units. However the feed to theseunits is usually heavy residual oils, which if heated to vaporize the product distillaterequired at atmospheric pressure (or near atmospheric pressure) would cause thefeed to crack and coke. The system is therefore set at low vacuum pressure sothat the vaporizing temperature is well below the feed’ s cracking properties. Thedistillates are produced in the same way as that for the atmospheric units. That is byselective cooled reﬂux streams. Full details of a crude oil vacuum process are alsogiven in Chapter 3 of this book. Vacuum distillation is also used for the distillationof light residues from hydrocrackers to produce light vacuum distillates and heavyresiduum for further thermal cracking.
rLight ends distillation. The most common of this type of distillation is the crude
unit light ends process. The feed to this unit is the overhead distillate from theatmospheric crude unit. This feed may also include overhead distillate from otherprocesses (such as the catalytic reformer). The product from the light end s process isthe production of light and heavy naphtha, butane LPG, propane LPG, and reﬁnerygas. These processes are discussed fully in Chapter 4 of this book.
Drums
Drums may be horizontal or vertical vessels. Generally drums do not contain complex
internals such as fractionating trays or packing as in the case of towers. They are usedhowever for removing material from a bulk material stream and often use simplebafﬂe plates or wire mesh to maximize efﬁciency in achieving this. Drums are usedin a process principally for:
rRemoving liquid droplets from a gas stream (knockout pot), or separating vaporand liquid streams
rSeparating a light from a heavy liquid stream (separators)
rSurge drums to provide suitable liquid hold up time within a process
rTo reduce pulsation in the case of reciprocating compressors
Drums are also used as small intermediate storage vessels in a process.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1129
V apor disengaging drums
One of the most common example of the use of a drum for the disengaging of vapor
from a liquid stream is the steam drum of a boiler or a waste heat steam generator.Here the water is circulated through a heater where it is risen to its boiling pointtemperature and then routed to a disengaging drum. Steam is ﬂashed off in this drumto be separated from the liquid by its superﬁcial velocity across the area above thewater level in the drum. The steam is then routed to a super-heater and thus to the steammain. The performance of the steam super-heater depends on receiving fairly “ dry”saturated steam. That is steam containing little or no water droplets. The separationmechanism of the steam drum is therefore critical.
The design of a vapor disengaging drum depends on the velocity of the vapor and the
area of disengagement. This is expressed by the equation:
V
e=0.157/radicalbiggρl−ρv
ρv
where
Vc=Critical velocity of vapor in ft/sec.
ρl=Density of liquid phase in lbs/cuft.
ρv=Density of vapor phase in lbs/cuft.
The area used for calculating the linear velocity of the vapor is:
rThe vertical cross sectional area above the high liquid level in a horizontal drum
rThe horizontal area of the drum in the case of vertical drums
The allowable vapor velocity may exceed the critical, and normally design veloc-ities will vary between 80% and 170% of critical. The use of crinkled wire meshscreens (CWMS) screens are an effective entrainment separators and are often usedin separator drums for that purpose.
Liquid separation drums
The design of a drum to perform this duty is based on one of the following laws of
settling:

Lighter Phase. Heavy Phase. Minimum Droplet Size.
0.850 SG and lighter. water 0.008 ins.
Heavier than 0.850. water 0.005 ins.
The holdup time required for settling is the vertical distance in the drum allocated to
settling divided by the settling rate.
Settling bafﬂes, are often used to reduce the holdup time and the height of the liquid
level.
Surge drums
This type of drum, the calculation of holdup time and surge control is used in the
control the movement of liquids from one process to another. It’ s purpose is to smoothout the ﬂow to meet the process criteria. For example, when a liquid feed leaves theﬁrst process item (such as an overhead reﬂux drum) under level control a surge drummay be used to collect the feed and deliver it under ﬂow control to the next process.This is particularly desirable if the feed enters a ﬁred heater as the ﬁrst item of thesecond process.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1131
Pulsation drums or pots
This type of drum is used almost entirely in the operation of a reciprocating com-
pressors. It is used to smooth out the compressed gas ﬂow leaving the compressorcylinders.
E
Economic evaluations
Economic evaluation is used for most aspects of the reﬁnery planning, and its op-
eration. The methods used in this evaluation may differ from company to company,but the end product must reﬂect the proﬁtability of the present and often the fu-ture proﬁtability of a proposed venture or operation. This measure is reﬂected interms of the Return on Investment of the item. This is described and discussed inChapter 8.
The following deﬁnitions and items are used in the economic evaluation exercises:
Ad volorum tax. This is the ﬁxed tax levied in most countries payable to local mu-
nicipal authorities, provincial, or state authorities to cover property tax, municipal
service costs etc.
Calculation of cash ﬂow method. There are several methods of assessing proﬁtability
based on discounted cash ﬂow (DCF), but the most reliable yardstick is a return on
investment method using the Present Worth (or Net Present Value) concept. Thisconcept equates the present value of a future cash ﬂow as a product of the presentinterest value factor and the future cash ﬂow. Based on this concept, the Return on
Investment is that Interest value or Discount Factor which forces the CumulativePresent Worth value to Zero over the economic life of the project.
Net investment costs. The Net Investment for the project includes the capital cost of
the plant, which is subject to depreciation, and the Associated Costs, which may not
be subject to depreciation.
The capital cost of the plant is the contractor’ s selling price for the engineering,
equipment, materials, and the construction of the facilities. In a process study usinga DCF return on investment calculation, the capital cost should be an estimate withan accuracy at least that based on an equipment factored type.1132 CHAPTER 19
The associated costs include the following elements:
rAny licensor’ s paid up royalties
rCost of land
rFirst inventory of chemicals and catalyst
rCost of any additional utilities or offsite facilities incurred by the project
rChange in feed and product inventory
rWorking capital
Capitalized construction period loan interest
Construction period. This is the period before year 0 during which the plant is con-
structed and commissioned. Assume this period is 3 years, this is designated as end of
year –2, –1, 0. During this period, the construction company will receive incrementalpayments of the total capital cost of the plant with ﬁnal payment at the end of year 0.The construction cost may be paid from the company’ s equity alone or from equityand an agreed loan or entirely from a loan. In the case of a loan to satisfy this debt, thepayment of the loan interest commences in this period. The interest payment over thisperiod, however, is usually capitalized and paid over the economic life of the project.
Depreciation. Part of the cost to a project or venture which is considered as a de-
ductible from the gross proﬁt for tax purposes is the depreciation of the plant value.
This is calculated over the PLANT LIFE as the plant capital cost divided by the plantlife. The term Plant Life is the predicted life of the facility before it has to be disman-tled and sold for scrap. Usually this is set at 20 years and indeed all speciﬁcationsrelating to engineering and design of the facilities will carry this requirement. So allmaterial and design criteria, such as corrosion allowances, associated with the plantwill meet this plant life parameter.
Discounted cash ﬂow, deﬁnition of. The development of a DCF return on investment
is a combined effort between the Technical Disciplines and the company’ s Finance"
"Specialist. The engineers provide the technical input to the work such as operatingcosts, type of plants, construction schedules, and cost, yield and reﬁnery fence productprices, and the like. While the ﬁnancial specialist provides the ﬁnancial data basedon statutory and company policies, such as the form of depreciation, tax exemptions,tax credits (if any), items forming part of the company’ s ﬁnancial strategy, etc. Thecalculation itself is in two parts, which are:
rCalculation of Cash Flow
rPresent Worth Calculation. (or any other method for calculating the Return onInvestment the Company may use)
Economic life. This is the number of years over which the project is expected to
yield the projected proﬁt and pay for its installation. These are the number of yearsA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1133
starting at year 0 which indicates the end of construction and the commissioning of
the facilities. The last year (usually year 10) is the year in which all loans and otherproject costs are repaid and the “ Terminal Investment” released.
Plant Operating Cost. This includes the cost of utilities used in the process, such as
power, steam, and fuel. It also includes the cost of plant personnel in salaries, burdens,
and indirects and the cost of chemicals and catalyst used.
rMaintenance. There are two kinds of maintenance costs included in this item These
are the preventive maintenance carried out on a routine basis, and those costsassociated with incidental breakdowns and repair.
rLoan repayment. The loan principal is paid back in equal increments over the
economic life of the plant. This item includes the payback increments and theassociated interest on a declining basis.
Net cash ﬂow. This item is calculated for each year of the project’ s economic life. It
commences with year 0 with the net investment shown as a negative net cash ﬂowitem. Then for each successive year until the end of the last year of the economiclife, the net cash ﬂow is calculated as the sum of Proﬁt After Tax PLUS Deprecia-
tion.
The depreciation is added here because it is not really a cost to the project. It is a
“ Book” cost only and is used speciﬁcally for tax calculation.
The cash ﬂow item for the last year of the economic life must now include the
“ Terminal Investment Item” . This item is the sum of the net scrap value of the plant(scrap value less cost of dismantling), the estimated value of the land and the WorkingCapital initially used as part of the “ Associated Costs” .
Thus, the ﬁnal cash ﬂow item will be the sum of Proﬁt After Tax, plus Depreciation,
plus Terminal Investment.
With the Net Cash Flow in place, the second part of the calculation which is the
determination of the Return on Investment for the project can be carried out.
Pay out time. The pay out time for a project or any venture is given by the expre-
ssion:
Net Investment Cost
Net Income after taxes +depreciation=Y ears
Simple return on investment. This calculation is used for screening purposes of several
options that are apparent in any venture. It does not consider construction time or the1134 CHAPTER 19
discounting of the cash ﬂow over the economic life of a plant. Its deﬁnition is given
by the equation:
Net Income after Taxes
Net Investment Cost×100=%R O I
Where
Net Investment is Capital Cost plus Associated Cost.
Net Income is Gross income less operating cost, depreciation, and tax.
Revenue. This is income received for the sale of the product(s). This is calculated from
projected process yields of products multiplied by the market price of the products.
A market survey should already have been completed to ensure that the additionalproducts generated by the project are in demand and the price is in an acceptablerange. Later, a sensitivity analysis of the DCF return on investment may be conductedchanging the revenue recovered by price escalation or other means.
Taxable income. Taxable income is revenue less operating cost, depreciation, and Ad
Valorem Tax. This of course is simply put as in most countries, states, or provinces
there will probably be certain local tax relief principals and tax credits that will affectthe ﬁnal taxable income ﬁgure. The company’ s ﬁnancial specialist will be in theposition to apply these where necessary.
Tax. This is quite simply the tax rate applied to the “ Taxable Income” ﬁgure. This
will vary from location to location but will be taken as one rate over the economic life
of the project for the purpose of a process study, unless there are legislative changesalready in place.
Working capital. In all capital projects there is initially a ﬁnancial loss when the
company has to purchase land, equipment, pay contractors to erect equipment, and"
"the like. To do this not unlike most private individuals, companies may need toborrow money, on which of coarse they have to pay interest. In addition to the costof construction, the company must keep in hand some capital by which it can buyfeedstock, chemicals, and pay the salary of its staff during the commissioning andthe initial operation of the plant. During this initial operation, the working capitalmust also be considered as debt. At the end of this period of the project initiation, theoperation must recover the working capital and make its prescribed proﬁt.
Edmister correlations
A series of correlations which relates an ASTM distillation test to the TBP
of a petroleum cut is presented in W . Edmister’ s publication titled “ AppliedA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1135
Thermodynamics” . The correlation relating to the ASTM and TBP curves from this
book is used in this Handbook and is given in Chapter 1. Similar correlations havealso been prepared by Edmister for the relation between TBP and the equilibriumﬂash vapor curve (EFV).

The most undesirable pollutants in aqueous waste streams are:
rThose that deplete the dissolved oxygen content of the waterways into which they
discharge.
rThose contaminants that are toxic to all forms of life, such as arsenic, cyanide,mercury, and the like.
rThose contaminants that impart undesirable tastes and odors to streams and otherwaterways into which they discharge.
Oxygen depletion occurs by the introduction of one or more of the following oxidizablecontaminants entering the waterway:1136 CHAPTER 19
rNatural pollution by surface run-off rainwater, or melting snow, in the form of
soluble salts leached from the earth.
rNatural pollution caused by decay of organic plants from swamps or other sources.
rHuman and animal life excretion.
rChemical pollution from reducing agents in industrial plant wastes. Such as sulﬁdes,nitrites, ferrous salts, etc.
rBiochemical pollution from such industrial wastes as phenols, hydrocarbons, car-bohydrates, and the like.
The degree of oxygen depletion from the pollution sources described above may becatalogued by the following terms:
BOD— Biological Oxygen Demand
COD— Chemical Oxygen DemandIOD— Immediate Oxygen Demand
BOD. Since all natural waterways will contain bacteria and nutrients; almost any
waste compound introduced into the waterways will initiate biochemical reactions.
These reactions will consume some of the dissolved oxygen in the water.
The depletion of oxygen due to biological pollution is not very rapid. It follows the
laws of ﬁrst order reaction. Because of this, the effect of BOD is measured in thelaboratory on a ﬁve day basis, and has been universally adopted as the measure ofpollution effect. The “ Ultimate”BOD is a measure of the total oxygen consumedwhen the biological reaction proceeds to almost completion. The “ 5 day”BOD isbelieved to be approximately the Ultimate.
In summary, BOD measures organic wastes which are biologically oxidizable.

COD. The COD is a measure of the oxygen depletion due to organic and inorganic
wastes which are chemically oxidizable. There are several laboratory methods ac-
cepted to measure the oxygen depletion effect of these pollution. The two most widelyaccepted are the “ 4 hour Permanganate” method or the “ 2 hour Dichromate” method.Although there is no generalized correlation between BOD and COD, usually theCOD will be larger than the BOD. The following table illustrates how different wastesexhibit a different relationship between COD and BOD.

IOD. Oxygen consumption by reducing chemicals such as sulﬁdes and nitrates is
typiﬁed as follows:
S−−+2O2→SO−
4−
NO−2+1
2O2→NO−3
These types of inorganic oxidation reactions are very rapid and create what is measured
in the laboratory as immediate oxygen demand. If waste contaminants contain theseinorganic oxidizers, the “ 5 day” BOD test will include the consumption of the oxygendue to IOD also. A separate test to determine IOD must be made and this resultsubtracted from the “ 5 day” BOD to arrive at the true BOD result.
Toxic pollutants common to oil reﬁning. Toxic pollutants that are most commonly
contained in untreated reﬁnery aqueous wastes are:
Oil. Heavy oil and other hydrocarbons are the most problematic pollution to be found
in reﬁnery water efﬂuent. All reﬁneries exercise the most stringent methods to control
and remove these undesirable pollutants. Indeed in many cases the treated efﬂuentstreams leaving the reﬁnery may well be purer than incoming portable water used inthe processes.1138 CHAPTER 19
Phenols. This chemical often formed in reﬁnery processes such as catalytic and
thermal crackers, are highly toxic to aquatic life in concentrations of 1–10 ppm.
Apart from its toxicity phenols also unpleasant taste and odor to drinking water inthe range of 50–100 ppb. In concentrations of 200 ppm and more, these chemicalscan also deactivate water treatment plants such as trickle ﬁlters and activated sludgeunits.
Caustic soda and derivatives. Solutions containing sodium hydroxide are used in a
number of reﬁnery processes. Inevitably some of this chemical enters the reﬁnery’ s
waste water system. This contaminant is toxic to humans and marine life in even lowconcentrations. The spent caustic (compounds leaving the process) such as sodiumsulﬁde is even more injurious.
Aqueous solutions of ammonium salts. The most common of these are ammonium
sulﬁde NH
4SH, and ammonium chloride. Both these salts are present in efﬂuent
water from the crude distillation unit overhead accumulator, however the sulﬁde salt
is present in all aqueous efﬂuents from the cracking processes, and the hydro treaters.Other ammonium salts are also present in hydrocracking and deep oil hydrotreating.
Acids in aqueous efﬂuents. The most common of these are from the alkylation pro-
cesses which use either hydroﬂuoric acid or sulfuric acid. In some isomerization
processes, hydrochloric acid is used to promote the aluminum chloride catalyst. Insome older processes sulfur dioxide is used to remove aromatics. This efﬂuent usuallyleaves these plants as dilute sulfuric acid.
Ketones, furfural, and urea. These compounds are used in the reﬁning of lube oils.
MEK and Urea are used in the dewaxing processes while furfural is used in the
extraction processes for ﬁnished lube oil stock. All of these compounds are toxic.
Treating reﬁnery aqueous wastes
The treatment of aqueous wastes from oil reﬁneries fall into three categories. These
are:
rIn-plant treatment. These are onsite processes usually sour water strippers, spentcaustic oxidizers, and spent caustic neutralizers.
rThe API separator, or similar oil/water separating device.
rSecondary treatment, which includes chemical coagulation, activated sludge pro-cesses, trickle ﬁlters, air ﬂotation, and aerators.
Most energy reﬁneries contain only the ﬁrst two of the above categories. These pro-cesses are described in detail in this Handbook.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1139
Efﬂuent water treating
Sour water is usually treated in petroleum reﬁneries by one or more of the following
processes:
rSteam Stripping
rCaustic/Acid Neutralization
rCaustic Oxidization
rOil Removal by Settling
All three of these processes with brief description of the more uncommon processessuch as coagulation are also described fully in Chapter 14 of this Handbook. A briefsummary of these are as follows:
Sour water strippers. This is one of the most common treating processes. Its purpose
is to remove the pollutant gases included in process plant efﬂuents. The more
common pollutants in this case are ammonia, ammonium salts, and hydrogen sulﬁde.There are two types of strippers in this service; they are shown as Stripper A and B,respectively, below:

Both these type of sour water stripping lend themselves to tray by tray mass and heat"
"transfer. The sour water feed is introduced on the top tray of the tower while steamusually at a rates of 0.5–1.5 lbs/gallon of feed is introduced below the bottom tray.In the case of a tower with reﬂux the reﬂux enters the tower with the fresh feed. Thedesign of both towers utilizes the partial pressure relationship of NH
3and H 2Si n
aqueous solution. These relationships are given by a series of graphs to be found inAppendix 1 of Chapter 14.
The sour water stripper is almost always located in the process area of the reﬁnery.
The feed to the stripper is the efﬂuent water from the crude unit overhead conden-ser, the water phase from the desalter, the condensed water from the vacuum unit’ shot well, and all the water condensate from the hydro-treater product steam strip-pers. The sour water stripper may be a single tower with no reﬂux as in Type Aor a single trayed tower with an overhead reﬂux stream (Type B). The amount ofsteam used in both cases will be between 0.5 lbs steam per lb of feed to 1.5 lbs ofsteam.
Spent caustic disposal. The other major efﬂuent from oil reﬁning is the spent caustic
streams from hydrogen sulﬁde removal and also the removal of phenols. Reﬁners usu-
ally have the following options in the disposal of these streams. In order of preferencethese are listed as follows:
Phenolic spent caustic
rDisposal by sales
rDisposal by dumping at sea
rNeutralizing with acid
rNeutralizing with ﬂue gas
Sulﬁdic spent caustic
rDisposal by sales
rOxidation with air and steam
rNeutralization with acid and stripping
rNeutralization with ﬂue gas and stripping
These processes are also described and discussed in full in Chapter 14 of this Hand-
book. A brief summary is as follows:
Neutralizing phenolic spent caustic. As listed above phenolic spent caustic can be
neutralized using acid or ﬂue gas. When neutralized the mixture separates into two
liquid phases. The upper phase contains the acid oils while the lower phase is anaqueous solution of sodium sulfate or sodium carbonate. The neutralization usingA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1141
either acid or ﬂue gas can be accomplished in a batch or continuous operation. The
neutralization step is exothermic giving out around 125 Btu/lb of sprung acid. Asthe objective of the process is to produce a phenol free sprung water for disposalthe system temperature should be kept as low as possible until the sprung water isremoved. Routing the sprung water to the sour water stripper ensures the removal ofany entrained H
2S in that stream.
Spent caustic oxidation. Spent caustic cannot be steam stripped to remove the sul-
ﬁdes contained in it due to the H 2S removal process in which the caustic was used.
This is because sodium sulﬁde does not hydrolyze even when heated. Acids could beused, of course, to neutralize the spent caustic which would release gaseous H
2S. This
would however be a costly procedure and causes a potential air pollution problem.The alkaline sulﬁde can be economically oxidized to form thiosulfates and sulfates.This is the process most commonly used in reﬁneries where only sulﬁdes are thepollutants in the spent caustic and the release of gaseous H
2S is a problem. De-
tails of this process together with a process schematic drawing are given in Chap-ter 14.
Oil–water separation. Most aqueous efﬂuent from a reﬁnery will contain oil. This
oil content has to be reduced to at least 10 ppm before it can be deposited into a river,
lake, or ocean. The oil contamination sources are from process water run down, pavedarea drainage, storm catch-pots, tanker ballast pump out, and tank farm diked areas.All the water from these sources are treated in oil separation processes. The mostimportant of these oil–water separation process is the API Separator.
The API oil–water separator. The design of an API separator is based on the difference
in gravity of oil and water in accordance with the general laws of settling. In the design
of an API separator a modiﬁed version of Stoke’ s Law is used. In this law the rate ofsettling is given by the equation:
Vr=6.69×10
4d2/Delta1S
η
where
Vr=Rising rate of the oil phase in ft/min
d=Droplet diameter in ins.
/Delta1S=Difference in speciﬁc gravity of the phases.
η=Viscosity of the continuous phase (water) in centipoises.1142 CHAPTER 19
The above modiﬁed Stoke’ s Law for the API separator recognizes that the continuous
phase is water and the lighter oil phase is the one that is separated to be disposed asthe product skimmed from the surface.
An example of the application of the equation in the design of an API separator is
given in Chapter 14 Appendix 14.3 of this Handbook.
The oil phase from the separator is removed using specially designed skim pipes and
an oil sump. A simpliﬁed diagram of a typical API Separator is given below.

Storm surge ponds. These ponds are installed to provide storage for maximum rainfall
conditions. There are several forms of these surge ponds, some requiring pumps, some
located upstream of the API separator, and some downstream of the separator. In mostcases, the storm drain system is directed to the storm surge pond. Thus in a storm,the excess rainfall is held in this pond and fed to the API separator, over a period oftime and at a rate that will not exceed the separator’ s capability to handle the watereffectively. In this way, the reﬁnery ensures that any oily water will not by-pass theseparator under the worst condition. The size of the surge pond must be able to handleA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1143
the maximum rainfall and the ﬂow from all catch basins and open culverts that form
part of the reﬁnery drainage system.
Other reﬁnery water efﬂuent treatment processes. These are summarized below, but
are described more fully in Chapter 14.
Oxidation ponds. Oxidation ponds are usually used as a secondary efﬂuent clean up
after the API separator. There are three types of these ponds which are:
rAerobic— Where the oxidation of the water utilizes oxygen from the atmosphere
plus oxygen produced by photosynthesis.
rAnaerobic— Where oxidation of the wastes does not utilize oxygen.
rAerated— Where oxidation of the wastes utilizes oxygen introduced from the at-mosphere by mechanical aeration.
The processes described above are those met with in oil reﬁning most often. Indeedof the processes described above most reﬁneries only use the API separator and thesurge ponds to meet the oil/water separation required.
Air ﬂotation. The purpose of the air ﬂotation process is the clariﬁcation of waste water
by the removal of suspended solids and oil. This is achieved by dissolving air in waste
water under pressure, and then releasing it at atmospheric pressure. The released airforms bubbles which adhere to the solid matter and oil in the waste water. The bubblescause the adhered matter to ﬂoat in the froth on the surface of the water bulk. Thedissolved air in the water also achieves a reduction in the BOD of the efﬂuent stream.The ﬁgure below shows the principal of a typical air ﬂotation process.

End points
Whereas a cut point is an ideal temperature on a TBP curve to deﬁne the yield of a
fraction, the end points deﬁne the shape of the fraction when produced commercially.In actual process, the initial boiling point of a fraction will be much lower than its frontend cut point. The ﬁnal fraction boiling point will be higher than the correspondingcut point. This is demonstrated by the ﬁgure below:

There is a correlation between the TBP cut point and the ASTM end point. Thisis described in Chapter 1 of this Handbook. A relationship also exists for the 90%ASTM point and the TBP 90% cut point. With these two ASTM data and using anASTM probability graph (see Chapter 1) a full ASTM curve with its end points canbe drawn. This converted to a TBP curve is used to deﬁne the cut’ s properties.
Engineering ﬂow diagrams
Diagrams are used extensively by all disciplines of engineers to convey ideas and
data.
Process engineers use and in some cases develop three types of ﬂow diagrams to
project their work and responsibilities.
These are:
rThe Process Flow Diagram
rThe Mechanical Flow Diagram (sometimes called the P&I Diagram)
rThe Utilities DiagramA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1145
The process ﬂow diagram is always originated by the process engineer and he retains
sole responsibility for its future development and update. The Mechanical ﬂow dia-gram may also be initiated by the process engineer or it may be developed by othersfrom the process ﬂow diagram. In many companies, however, the process engineerremains responsible for its technical content, development, and its completeness. Theutilities diagram shows the routing, sizing, and speciﬁcation of all the utility ﬂowlines between units and within units of a process. This diagram is usually superim-posed on the plot layout diagram. The piping engineers or those engineers who areresponsible for initiating the plot plan drawing usually initiate the utilities drawingand administer it. The process engineer in this case is responsible for sizing the ﬂowlines, establishing ﬂow conditions of temperature and pressure, and for ensuring thatall lines have been included.
The process ﬂow diagramThis diagram is usually the ﬁrst drawing that will be produced for an engineering"
"or development project. In some cases, it may be preceded by a process block ﬂowdiagram but it is the process ﬂow diagram that is the basis for:
rA process deﬁnition
rA budget cost estimate
rAn equipment list
rA mechanical ﬂow diagram
rProcess equipment data sheets
The ﬂow diagram supports the material and energy balances for the process and es-tablishes the sequence and direction of the process ﬂow. The diagram also showsthe control philosophy that will be adopted for the process and the salient temper-ature/pressure conditions within the process. As a minimum therefore process ﬂowdiagrams should contain the following:
V essels. The outlines of all major vessels, such as towers, drums, tanks are shown.
Their equipment item number and their overall dimensions are indicated on the dia-
gram. Where vessels contain special internals, such as trays, demisters, packing, etcthese too should be simply indicated on the vessel drawing. For example, the numberof trays in a tower may be indicted by showing the top, feed, and bottom trays onlybut including their respective tray numbers. The main temperature and pressure con-ditions are also shown on the vessel drawing. For example on fractionation towers thetower top and bottom operating temperatures will be shown but only the top pressureis normally shown.
Heat exchangers. All heat exchangers are shown as single shells on the process ﬂow
diagram. That is, no attempt is made to show the number of passes or the type (i.e.,
shell & tube, or double pipe, etc.) on this diagram. The process ﬂows to and from these1146 CHAPTER 19
items are shown as ﬂowing through the shell side or the tube side. The exchanger item
number only is indicated on the ﬂow diagram adjacent to the equipment drawing.Its equipment name is normally not shown. The heat duty of the exchanger is alsoshown on the ﬂow diagram again adjacent to the equipment drawing and below theequipment number. The temperature conditions for the exchanger are shown on theprocess lines in and out of the equipment. No pressures are normally shown for thisequipment.
Air coolers. Air coolers are shown simply as a narrow rectangular block in a process
line with a fan symbol shown inside the rectangle as a dotted outline. The item number
appears directly below the rectangle and below that is given the operating duty of theitem in mm Btu/hr or kcal/hr, etc.
Heaters. Fired heaters are shown as box type with a stack outlet. The speciﬁc type
of heater or the number of tube passes are not shown on the process ﬂow diagram.
Again, only the equipment item number and the heater duty is given in the ﬂow diagramadjacent to the item drawing. The heating medium is shown as a single line enteringthe bottom of the equipment and marked only as ‘ fuel’ . The line would contain acontrol valve with an instrument control line to the process coil outlet showing theﬁring control philosophy. The temperatures connected with the heater are shown onthe process line in and out of the equipment. Normally no pressure levels are shownfor this item.
Pumps. Pumps are shown in as simple a manner as possible. Most companies carry
their own symbols for equipment. Many however show a centrifugal pump simply as a
circle with the suction line proceeding to the center of the circle and the discharge lineleaving tangentially from the top. Other symbols are used for positive displacementpump types. Only these two types are differentiated on the process ﬂow diagram. Thevarious types within these categories are not indicated. The pump item number andan indication as to whether the pump is spared is shown adjacent to the pump drawingon the ﬂow diagram. If the pump is spared then the item number will be followed by“ A+B” . If it is not spared it will be followed by the letter “ A” only. The capacity of
the pump as gallons per minute (GPM) or cubic meters per hour will be shown underthe item number. This is the normal or operating capacity.
Compressors. These equipment are shown as either centrifugal or reciprocating ma-
chines. The centrifugal type are shown similar to the centrifugal pump or as a trapezoid
and the reciprocating type is shown as two small square boxes connected by a doubleline. The item number appears below the item and in some cases indicates the numberof stages. The capacity in standard or normal units is given below the item numberwhile the temperature/pressure conditions to and from the item are shown on theprocess lines to and from.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1147
Process lines. All major process lines interconnecting equipment, recycle, or bypasses
are shown on the process ﬂow diagram. These lines will show direction of ﬂow as
black arrows on the lines. Control valves and major block valves are also shown onthese lines. The temperature and pressure conditions of the ﬂowing material are givenon the lines at appropriate positions in the drawing.
Instruments. Only major control instrumentation are shown and the instrument sym-"
"bols are kept as simple as possible. Details of instrument ‘ hook ups’are conﬁned
to showing the control valve being activated from either a level, ﬂow, pressure, ortemperature elements by a dotted line to the valve. The measurement instruments thataffect control are shown as circles with the type of instrument (e.g., FC— for ﬂowcontroller, TC— for temperature controller, etc.) printed in the circle.
The material balance. The material balance for the process represented by the process
ﬂow diagram is either shown in table form on the bottom of the ﬂow sheet or on an
attached but separate table. Preferably it should appear on the ﬂow sheet itself. Thetable should contain at least the following:
rThe stream number— This is the number given to the process stream and referencedon the respective process line in the diagram. This initiates the columns that willmake-up the table.
rThe stream identiﬁcation— This next line should identify the stream, such as “ Debu-
tanizer bottoms” for each of the columns.
rThe items following down the title column consists of, the ﬂow rate for each streamas wt per unit time, the stream temperature, the speciﬁc gravity at a standard temper-ature for liquids, the mole wt for gas streams, volume ﬂow at standard temperature(and pressure for gasses), stream pressure for gasses.
The mechanical ﬂow diagram
The mechanical ﬂow diagram (MFD) is developed from the process ﬂow diagram.
The detail provided by the MFD is sufﬁcient for other engineering disciplines to:
rInitiate a plot layout
rPrepare a line list. (Piping design)
rInitiate piping arrangement drawings (Piping design)
rPrepare a preliminary piping material take off
rPrepare an instrument register (Instrument engineering)
rInitiate instrument “ hook up drawings” (Instrument design)
rPrepare electrical “ one line drawings” (Electrical engineering)
rPrepare preliminary Instrument and electrical material take off
rInitiate civil and structural design (Civil engineering)
rDevelop the project execution plan (Planning engineers)
rPrepare a semi deﬁnitive cost estimate (Cost estimators)1148 CHAPTER 19
To meet these objectives, the Mechanical Flow Diagram will contain more detail of
the process and the equipment included in it than the Process Flow Diagram. This isdescribed brieﬂy in the following paragraphs:
V essels. Vessels are shown in approximate relative size to one another whereever
possible. Again, only the top and bottom trays need be shown, unless other trays are
required to indicate the location of side draws, instruments, sample points or changesin type of tray layout. Trays are numbered sequentially either from top to bottom orbottom to top. Catalyst beds, packing, demisters, and the type of tray (such as singlepass or double pass, etc.) are shown. The height of packing etc is shown adjacentto the vessel and the height of all vessels above grade is also shown on the vessel.The following detail is usually shown on the top of the ﬂow sheet directly above thevessel:
rVessel Item Number (this should also appear in or near the vessel drawing).➢Title
➢Size (Inside diameter, and length tan to tan)
➢Design temperature and pressure
➢Insulation (i.e., Indication is the vessel insulated or not)
➢Trim Number (Line speciﬁcation for miscellaneous vessel connections)
Heat exchangers. The actual arrangement and type of heat exchangers are shown on
the MFD. Shell and tube exchangers are still shown as circles with tube side ﬂowsin dotted lines as in the process ﬂow diagram. Here, however the actual number ofshell passes is shown. Double pipe and reboilers are shown in their speciﬁc format,and again the actual number of shell passes. The following data for each exchangeris shown at the top of the ﬂow diagram:
rThe heat exchanger item number. (This is also shown adjacent to the exchangerdrawing)
rThe title
rThe duty of the exchanger (In Btu/hr, or Kcal/hr, etc.)
rInsulation
Air coolers. As in the case of the heat exchangers, air coolers are shown in more detail
on the MFD than on the process ﬂow diagram. Usually on the MFD the air cooler isshown as a narrow rectangle. The fan in this case is drawn below the rectangle for aforced draft cooler or above the rectangle in the case of an induced air cooler. Onlyone process line is shown to and from the cooler but the number of passes is shown onthese lines. Any temperature control by louvres or variable pitch fans is shown on thediagram together with the appropriate instrumentation. The following data is givenat the top of the MFD above the cooler:A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1149
rThe cooler item number (this is also shown adjacent to the drawing)
rThe title
rDuty of the cooler
Fired heaters. The outline of the furnace is shown as being a cylindrical or a cabin
type heater. Most companies carry their own symbols to portray this feature. The"
"actual number of passes is shown on an inlet and outlet header together with thecontrol system for the process ﬂow. Only one pass is shown as entering and leavingthe heater however and ﬂowing through the item. The internal ﬂow is shown as adotted line in the ﬁre box. All instrumentation for the heater is shown in detail— suchas temperature points on the heater coil and in the ﬁre box, oxygen analyzers in thechimney and the chimney damper control. Snufﬁng steam and de-coking manifoldsare usually shown as separate details. The ﬁring control system is shown in detail.Usually this follows a standard adopted by the company for all the heaters. All theinstrumentation interlocks and safety features are detailed in the MFD for all heaters.The following data is provided for this item at the top of the ﬂow diagram and aboveeach heater:
rThe item number
rTitle
rDuty of the heater
Pumps. Pumps are shown in much greater detail on the MFD than on the process
ﬂow diagram. The pump drawing itself shows the type of pump and the type of driver.For example, a centrifugal pump is shown as a narrow vertical parallel lines curved atboth ends and resting on a base plate. A motor driver is shown as a small horizontalrectangle curved at both ends also resting on the base plate and connected to thepump by a short line. Process suction lines enter the center of the pump case andthe discharge line leaves from the top of the casing. All pumps are shown in thesame detail, that is both normal operating pump and its spare are shown. Process(and utility) lines connecting the pumps in a set are shown together with the valveconﬁguration. Isolating block valves, non-return valves, etc on the pumps are showntogether with cooling systems where required. Instrumentation for automatic pumpstart and stop is also detailed together with electrical switches for manual start/stopfacilities. Pumps and other rotary equipment are normally drawn on the bottom of theﬂow diagram. The data supplied on the MFD for pumps are given below the item onthe bottom of the diagram and are as follows:
rPump item number (followed by “ A”for normally operating and “ B”for spare
pump).
➢Title
➢Flow rate (gpm or m
3/hr, etc)
➢Differential pressure (psi, kPa, etc)1150 CHAPTER 19
➢SG of pumped ﬂuid at pumping temperature
➢Miscellaneous auxiliary piping (cooling water, ﬂushing oil, seal oil, etc.)
Piping. The MFD is among the most important documents that are developed in the
course of a fully engineered project that can proceed to construction and ﬁnally to
operation. Its importance is probably highest in the case of the piping engineeringand design function of a project. For this discipline, the MFD is the basis for all theirwork. Any piping detail that is required to deﬁne the work must appear on this ﬂowdiagram if it is to be included at all in the constructed facility. The diagram thenbecomes a major communication tool for multi discipline interfaces.
In the layout of a MFD, process feed lines should originate at the left hand end of
the drawing and the process product lines terminate at the right hand of the drawing.Where this is impractical, origin and terminus of the lines are located for clarity andconvenience. The origin and terminus of each process line in any case are identiﬁedby a box which shows the descriptive title of the line, the drawing number, and sectionnumber of any reference drawing. Where possible process lines between equipmentdrawings are located either above the line of equipment or below the line of equipment.Every effort in the layout should be made to avoid breaking lines around equipment.Piping high point vents or low point drains are not shown on the MFD unless theyhave some signiﬁcant process requirement. Any pertinent requirement for processreasons on any line must be noted. This includes such requirements as no pocketing,sloping, etc. These type of notes are clearly marked on the respective lines.
Utility lines originate and terminate adjacent to the equipment involved. Only the
length of line necessary for valves, instrumentation, and line numbering is shown.The utility line origin and terminus are identiﬁed by a descriptive title only. (e.g.,“ LP Steam” and “ LP Condensate” ). Main utility headers are not shown— these will
appear on the “ Utility Flow Diagram” .
All line sizes are shown on the lines they refer to. Where there is a change in a line
size this is also indicated by a “ swage” up or down. All valve sizes are indicated onthe MFD even if they are line size. Flow direction on all lines (whether process orutility) are clearly shown by directional arrows on the lines. Steam or electrical heattracing are also indicated on the lines that require it.
Instrumentation. All instrumentation is shown on the MFD in detail. This detail
includes:
rSize of control valves
rInstrument hookup method
rVessel surge levels and level range
rType of instrument activation (i.e., pneumatic or electronic)A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1151"
"rComputer interface if it applies
rInstrument identiﬁcation number
rPosition of the control valve on air failure (i.e., failed open or closed)
Instrument symbols are usually to ISA standard with some minor modiﬁcations to
meet the respective company’ s needs.
The utility ﬂow diagram
Process input to the utility ﬂow diagram development is minor compared with that
for the PFD and MFD. It involves the sizing of the utility lines and valves only.The process engineer is responsible to ensure that all the necessary utility lines tosatisfy the process have been included. The UFD itself is based on the approvedplot layout of the plant and/or plants and is usually prepared by others. It showsthe direction of ﬂow and sequence of equipment geographically just as they appearon the plot plan. Although process input to the UFD as such is minor, there willbe considerable detail necessary to complete the entire utility picture. For example,the UFD will show an instrument air header serving all the units in the process.This header will originate at the instrument air compressor set and dryers. This ori-gin will only be indicated on the UFD with reference to a detail drawing for theinstrument air compressor set. This detail drawing will be a MFD and the processengineer will have the same input and responsibility for this diagram as for any otherMFD.
Drawings of sections of all these engineering drawings are given in Appendix A of
this volume to illustrate this topic.
Equilibrium ﬂash vaporization (EFV)
When a mixture of compounds vaporizes or condenses, there is an unique relationship
between the composition of the mixture in the liquid phase and that in the correspond-ing phase at any condition of temperature and pressure. This relationship is termedthe equilibrium ﬂash vaporization for the mixture. It can be calculated using the com-position of the feed mixture and the equilibrium constant of the components in themixture. This is expressed by the equation:
L=x
f
1+(V/L)K
where
L=Total moles/hr of a component in the liquid phase.
xf=Moles/hr of the component in the feed.1152 CHAPTER 19
V/L=The ratio of total moles vapor to total moles liquid.
K=The equilibrium constant for each component at the ﬂash condition of
temperature and pressure.
There are several publications giving values for K. Among these are the charts in
Maxwell’ s“Data Book on Hydrocarbons” which are based on fugacities. Others may
be found in engineering data books such as “ Gas Processors Suppliers Association”which are based on convergence pressures. A rough and ready substitute for Kfactors
is to use the vapor pressure of the component divided by the system pressure. This,however, should not be used for any deﬁnitive design work nor in systems which haveazeotropes or are near their critical conditions. A method for calculating equilibriumﬂash vaporization is given by the following steps.
Step 1. Prepare a table with the ﬁrst column giving the components making up the feed.
The second column will be the composition of the feed in mol/hr. The third column
is a listing of the equilibrium constant Kfor each component at the temperature and
pressure of the ﬂash condition. Allow up to three columns following for assumptionsofV/L. Each of these three columns should be subdivided into two. The ﬁrst giving
the product of ( V/L)Kand the second for listing the “ L”for each component.
Other columns may be added to calculate mole wt of vapor and SG of the liquidphase.
Step 2. Assume a value for V/L. This is a judged assumption but start with 1.0 or 0.1
whichever seems to be the more realistic. Calculate ( V/L)Kfor each component.
Step 3. Calculate “ L” for each component from the equation:
L=X
f
1+(V/L)K
Step 4. The calculated V/Lis now obtained by adding the “ L” column and subtracting
this value from the total moles of feed in column 1. This subtraction is the vapormoles as calculated. Then the calculated V/Lis arrived at by dividing the total V
by the total of the “ L” column.
Step 5. The calculation is complete when V/Lcalculated is equal to V/Lassumed.
An answer within 5% is usually acceptable. If the calculated V’ s assumed is not
within this limit make another assumption for V/Land repeat steps 2, 3, 4. For
this second assumption try 5, or 0.5, or 0.05, whichever is more appropriate.
Step 6. If there is still no agreement between assumed and calculated V/Lplot the
two trial points (assumed Vs calculated) on log graph paper. Draw a straight line
through these two points and note where on this line assumed V/L=calculated
V/L. This value is the next assumed V/L. Repeat the calculation Steps 2–4 using
this value; this usually completes the calculation. If it does not then check that theconditions for the ﬂash are within the boiling point and condensing point for thefeed.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1153

Predicting the EFV curve from TBP data. For crude oils and complex mixtures such
as the heavy products the equilibrium vaporization curve can be calculated from theTBP curve using empirical methods given by Edmister or Maxwell. In this work theEFV is based on the method by Maxwell in his book “ Hydrocarbon Data” . This
method has been described in Chapter 1 of this Handbook.

FCCU (The ﬂuid catalytic cracking unit)
Introduction and a brief history of the process. The Fluid Catalyst Cracking Unit
(FCCU) is a process for converting middle and heavy distillates to high-octane1154 CHAPTER 19
gasoline and oleﬁn-rich light gases. It was developed during World War II to pro-
vide the high-octane fuel required by the war effort. The ﬁrst unit of its kind wasbrought on stream in the USA in 1942. These ﬁrst models of the process were a side-by-side reactor/regenerator conﬁguration. The transfer line for the catalyst betweenthe two items was relatively short and the design as such was aimed at concentratingthe reaction in the reactor’ s ﬂuid bed. To achieve effective transfer of the catalystbetween the two items the reactor was operated at a slightly higher pressure than theregenerator and the regenerator elevated to provide the hydraulic head. A series ofslide valves provided the control of catalyst ﬂow between the two units.
The catalysts used in these early units were simply ﬁnely ground silica alumina.
These had poor ﬂuidization characteristics and were fragile producing a high quantityof ﬁnes. The conversion rate with this type of catalyst was also low at about +or
−50L V%. After the war and during the 1950’ s the development of catalytic reformingof straight run naphtha with its additional bonus of cheap hydrogen reduced thepopularity of the FCCU considerably. Its revival as the accepted ‘ work horse’ofreﬁning came with the development of riser cracking and the use of zeolite catalystsduring the early 1960s. These two developments projected the process back to itsprominence principally because it could upgrade low quality products to high qualitygasoline and LPG cheaply and at high conversion. Today it still remains a principalprocess in heavy oil processing. Further advances in catalyst management and inthe process itself provides a unit which can convert certain atmospheric and vacuumresidues directly to more valuable products. A complete description of the processwith details of its chemistry and reactor mechanism is given in Chapter 6 of thisHandbook. The following is a summary of the process reactor side mechanism.
Process description
“ A typical ‘ side by side’ﬂuid catalytic cracking unit” .A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1155
The “ heart” of the process consists of reactor vessel and a regenerator vessel intercon-
nected to allow the transfer of spent catalyst from the reactor to the regenerator andof regenerated catalysts back to the reactor. The heat for the oil cracking is suppliedby exothermic heat of the catalyst regeneration. This heat is transferred by the regen-erated ﬂuid catalyst stream itself. The oil streams (feed and recycle) are introducedinto this hot catalyst stream on route to the reactor. Much of the cracking occurs inthe dispersed catalysed phase along this transfer line or riser.
The ﬁnal contact with catalyst bed in the reactor completes the cracking mechanism."
"The vaporized cracked oil from the reactor is suitably separated from entrained cat-alyst particles (by cyclone) and routed to the recovery section of the unit. Here it isfractionated by conventional means to meet the product stream requirements. Thespent catalyst is routed from the reactor to the regenerator after separation from en-trained oil. Air is introduced into the regenerator and the ﬂuid bed of the catalyst.The air reacts with the carbon coating on the catalyst to form CO/CO
2. The hot and
essentially carbon free catalyst completes the cycle by its return to the reactor. Theﬂue gas leaving the regenerator is rich in CO. This stream is often routed to a speciallydesigned steam generator where the CO is converted to CO
2and the exothermic heat
of reaction used for generating steam (the CO boiler). Alternatively, CO combustionpromoters may be used within the regenerator.
Feed stocks to the FCCU are primarily in the heavy vacuum gas oil range. Typical boil-
ing ranges are 640
◦F (10%) to 980◦F (90%). This gas oil is limited in end point by max-
imum tolerable metals, although the new zeolite catalysts have demonstrated highermetals tolerance than the older silica–alumina catalysts. The process has considerableﬂexibility. Apart from processing the more conventional waxy distillates to producegasoline and other fuel components, feed stocks ranging from naphtha to suitably pre-treated residuum are successfully processed to meet speciﬁc product requirement.
A summary of the mechanism of ﬂuid catalytic cracking. The feed stock to FCCUs are
usually the higher distillates of the crude barrel. The feed stock in this range of material
therefore contains compounds of complex structure, some of which are contaminatedby inorganic molecules such as sulfur, metals (vanadium, sodium, nickel, and the like).The amounts of these contaminants will vary for different crudes and the boiling rangeof the feed. The feed stock will also demonstrate a differing ease to its ability to crackunder the conditions of the FCCU.
The mechanism of the cracking itself is extremely complex, and many theories have
been offered to account for this. Certainly under the high temperature conditions ofthe FCC reactor, one can expect thermal cracking to occur, and to some extent thishappens. Thermal cracking however results in the random fracture of the hydrocarboncompounds and there is very little selectivity in the resulting product content andyields. This is not the case in Fluid Catalytic cracking, indeed one of the process’ s1156 CHAPTER 19
main attraction is its high selectivity in its product make. The most generally accepted
theory for this is the carbonium ion mechanism. It is believed that the carbonium ionin this cracking mechanism is initiated from an oleﬁn’ s early contact with the catalystat the high riser temperature condition. Once formed the ion reacts to:
rCrack larger molecules to smaller ones
rReact with other molecules
rIsomerize
rReact with the catalyst to terminate a chain
The cracking reaction then tends to follow the following route where the C
C bond

The oleﬁn may form new carbonium ions while the R ion reacts to form secondaryand tertiary carbonium ions. The tertiary ion is the more stable, and is probably themore active in this cracking mechanism.

Formation of coke on the catalyst. The formation of coke on the catalyst is an un-
avoidable occurrence of the catalytic cracking process. The mechanism of the coke
formation is also very complex as was the case in the cracking mechanism itself. It islikely that coke is formed by the dehydrogenation and condensation of poly aromaticsand oleﬁns. Its deposition on the catalyst however tends to block the active poreswhich will reduce the effectiveness of the catalyst. The only recourse to this is to burnoff the coke with air to form CO and CO
2. The heat of reaction for this coke burn
off becomes important to the process as it provides the heat of reaction on its transferfrom the regenerator to the reactor riser.

Fired heaters
Generally ﬁred heaters fall into two major categories:
rHorizontal type
rVertical type
The horizontal type heater usually means a box type heater with the tubes running
horizontally along the walls. Vertical type is normally a cylindrical heater containingvertical tubes. Full details of both these heater types are given in Chapter 18.
Horizontal box types are preferred for crude oil heaters, although vertical cylindrical
have been used in this service. Vacuum unit heaters should have horizontal tubesto eliminate the static head pressure at the bottom of vertical tubes and to reducethe possibility of two-phase slugging in the large exit tubes. Occasionally, severaldifferent services (“ coils” ) may be placed in a single heater with a cost saving. Thisis possible if the services are closely tied to each other in the process. Catalyticreforming pre-heater and re-heaters in one casing is an example. Reactor heater andstripper reboiler in one casing is another example. This arrangement is made possibleby using a refractory partition wall to separate the radiant coils. The separate radiantcoils may be controlled separately over a wide range of conditions by means of theirown controls and burners. If a convection section is used, it is usually common to theseveral services. If maintenance on one coil is required, the entire heater must be shutdown. Also, the range of controllability is less than with separate heaters.
Each of these types may be shop fabricated if size permits. Shop fabrication reduces
costs. However, shop fabrication should not be forced to the extent of getting animproperly proportioned heater.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1159
As ﬁred heaters have a live source of energy they are designed and manufactured to
strict codes. Details of these are also given in Chapter 18. These codes set the param-eters for heater tube thickness, tube, and heater dimension, Inspection requirements,and ﬁre protection.
Thermal rating. Thermal rating of ﬁred heaters is a complicated and specialized
procedure. While this procedure is described in Chapter 18 it is not detailed. For most
basic design and evaluation studies the following rules of thumb may be used:
Btu/hr sqft
Horizontal, ﬁred on one side 8,000–12,000
Vertical, ﬁred on one side from bottom 9,000–12,000Vertical, single row, ﬁred on both sides 13,000–18,000
Heater efﬁciency. The efﬁciency of a ﬁred heater is the ratio of the heat absorbed
by the process ﬂuid to the heat released by combustion of the fuel expressed as a
percentage.
Heat release may be based on the LHV (Lower Heating Value) of the fuel or HHV
(Higher Heating Value). Process heaters are usually based on LHV and boilers onHHV . The HHV efﬁciency is lower than the LHV efﬁciency by the ratio of the twoheating values.
Heat is wasted from a ﬁred heater in two ways:
rwith the hot stack gas
rby radiation and convection from the setting
The major loss is by the heat contained in the stack gas. The temperature of the stack
gas is determined by the temperature of the incoming process ﬂuid unless an air pre-heater is used. The closest economical approach to process ﬂuid is about 100
◦F. I f"
"the major process stream is very hot at the inlet, it may be possible to ﬁnd a colderprocess stream to pass through the convection section to improve efﬁciency, providedplant control, and ﬂexibility are adequately provided for. A more common methodof improving efﬁciency is to generate and/or superheat steam and preheat boiler feedwater. The lowest stack temperature that can be used is determined by the dew pointof the stack gases. The ﬁgures in Chapter 18 may be used to estimate ﬂue gas heatloss. Heat loss from the setting, called radiation loss, is about 1
1/2to 2% of the heat
release.
The range of efﬁciencies is approximately as follows:
Very high −90%+. Large boilers and process heaters with air pre-heaters.
High−85%. Large heaters with low process inlet temperatures and/or air pre-heaters.1160 CHAPTER 19
Usual— 70–80%.
Low— 60%.
Burners. The purpose of a burner is to mix fuel and air to ensure complete combustion.
There are about 12 basic burner designs. These are:
Direction — vertical up ﬁred
vertical down ﬁred
horizontally ﬁred
Capacity — high
low
Fuel type — gas

Flame shape — normal

Various combinations of the above types are available.
Details of gas, oil, and combination burners are given in Chapter 18, together with
burner controls and heater noise.
Chapter 18 under the section on ﬁred heaters continues with a description and dis-
cussion on refractories, stacks, and stack emission. Finally the chapter describes thespeciﬁcation for a typical ﬁred heater.
Flash points
The ﬂash point is a measure of the tendency of the, material to form a ﬂammable
mixture with air under controlled laboratory conditions. It is however only one ofseveral properties that must be considered in assessing the overall ﬂammable hazard ofA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1161
the material. The ﬂash point is used to establish the ﬂammable criteria in transporting
the material. Generally shipping and safety regulations will be based on the ﬂash pointcriteria. The ﬂash point should not however be used to describe or appraise the ﬁrehazard or risk under actual ﬁre conditions. Test method (D93 provides the closed cupﬂash point test procedures for temperatures up to 698
◦F). Details of the apparatus
used and the laboratory method for determining a ﬂash point is given in Chapter 16of this Handbook. The ﬂash point of two or more blended components is determinedby the volume composition of the components in the blend and the use of the ﬂashpoint index curve. This method and the index curve is given in Chapter 1 of thisHandbook. A simple estimate of a material’ s ﬂash point can be calculated from itsASTM distillation by the equation:
Flash Point
◦F=0.77(ASTM 5% −150◦F).
Flash zone
A ﬂash zone is associated with the distillation of crude oil, both atmospheric and
vacuum, the main fractionating towers of the ﬂuid catalytic cracking unit, visbreakeror thermal cracking units. The ﬂash zone is the area in these distillation towers wherethe distillate vapors are allowed to separate from the un-vaporized liquid. The transferline from the heater enters the ﬂash zone. The vapors rise up through the tower to becondensed by cold reﬂux streams coming down. Steam enters the ﬂash zone from thebottom product stripper section located below the ﬂash zone.
Flash zone conditions, particularly ﬂash zone temperature is difﬁcult to measure
accurately. This is due to the proﬁles set up in the ﬂash zone by turbulence of thefeed entering and vapor disengaging. Knowledge of ﬂash zone conditions is, however,essential when designing these units, evaluating their performance or trouble shootingthem. The item in Chapter 3 of this Handbook deals with a calculation procedure toestablish these ﬂash zone conditions for atmospheric and vacuum distillation crudedistillation towers.
Fractionation
This is a unit operation in chemical engineering which separates components from
mixtures in which they are contained. In petroleum reﬁning this separation process isa major means of separating precise groups of petroleum components from the crudeoil feed and other intermediate reﬁning processes. Separation by fractionation isaccomplished by heat and mass transfer on successive stages represented by carefullydesigned trays. These trays are designed to enhance the heat and mass transfer by goodmixing of hot vapors rising through the trays with colder liquid entering the tray. Themixing tends to achieve a phase equilibrium between the liquid and vapor trafﬁc.1162 CHAPTER 19
Fractionation as a separating tool is used extensively throughout the process industry."
"It can be a simple process separating just two components (such as water and alcohol)of very complex separation of multi components. It is the later that is required in thepetroleum processing industry. The calculation of the number of stages required forthe simple binary fractionation can be accomplished graphically using the McCabeThiele diagram, the number of stages required for the multi-component separationis achieved by using a number of complex equations, and the individual equilibriumconstants for the various components. The rigorous method for calculating the numberof fractionation stages in multi component separation is by stage to stage calculationwith ‘ trial and error’determination of the temperature and pressure conditions oneach stage. The calculation is complete when convergence of phase equilibria is meton the feed input stage. This is the method used in developing the computer simulationprogram for multi-component fractionation.
The method is simpliﬁed for manual computation by a correlation developed by
Gilliland (reference Maxwell’ s Data Book on Hydrocarbons). This is a corre-lation which relates minimum stages at total reﬂux to minimum reﬂux at inﬁ-nite number of stages. Figure 4.2, Chapter 4, is reproduced below to show thiscorrelation.

rThe Underwood equation which establishes the minimum reﬂux at inﬁnite stages.
The Underwood equation is more complex than the Fenske equation and requirestrial and error method for its solution. The equation itself is in two parts. The ﬁrstlooks at the vapor volatility (ratio of K’ s) of each component in the feed to one ofthe selected keys. Then by trial and error arriving at an expression for a factor ‘ B’that forces the equation to zero.This ﬁrst equation is written as follows:

the minimum reﬂux. This equation is

φi=is the relative volatility of component i
XiD=is the mole fraction of component i in the distillate
B=is the factor obtained from ﬁrst equation
Rm=minimum reﬂux at inﬁnite trays (R m+1include the reboiler)

Fractionation in the atmospheric and vacuum crude distillation towers
The method of Gilliland is impractical for use in the complex fractionation that is
experienced in the main reﬁnery towers handling the crude feed and other similarstreams in the reﬁning process. Packie J.W . developed an empirical method based onASTM distillation gaps to deﬁne the fractionation between adjacent cuts. This degreeof fractionation is measured by the temperature difference between the ASTM 95% ofthe lighter cut and the 5% temperature of the adjacent heavier cut. These differencescan be positive or negative. That is the 5% temperature of the heavier cut can behigher than the 95% temperature of the lighter cut. This difference is called an ASTM
Gap. On the other hand some adjacent cuts may demonstrate the reverse that is the
5% temperature of the heavier cut may be lower than the 95% temperature of thelighter cut. This difference is called an ASTM Overlap. Thus in a typical crude unit
speciﬁcation the fractionation may be quoted as follows:
The fractionation in the crude atmospheric distillation tower shall be:
95% naphtha ASTM temperature and the 5% temperature of the kero shall have a gap
of 25
◦F.
95% kero ASTM temperature and the light gas oil 5% temperature shall have a gap
of 0◦F.
95% LGO ASTM temperature and the heavy gas oil 5%temperature shall have an
overlap of no more than 15◦F( a– 1 5◦F gap).
The number of the fractionation trays required to meet the respective fractionation gaps"
"(overlaps) between cut draw-off in these main columns is based on a correlation. Thiscorrelation is a series of curves based on the 50% distillation temperature differencebetween the total vapor entering the draw off tray and the liquid leaving the tray.

Gaps and overlaps
Gaps and overlaps refer to the difference between the temperatures of the 95 vol%
recovered in a lighter cut and the 5 vol% recovered of the adjacent heavier cut basedon their ASTM distillation. The following diagrams illustrate this concept:

Vol Recovered                                             Vol Recovered
The ASTM Gap shown above would be typical in the separation between naphthaand kero in the atmospheric distillation unit. The 5% temperature of the kero (cut 2)is higher than the naphtha (cut 1) 95% temperature. This is a good separation becausethere are few kero components in the heavy end of the naphtha. The overlap illus-tration is typical of the separation between the heavier products of the atmosphericdistillation of crude oil such as between light gas oil cut and the heavy gas oil cut. AGAP then is when the numeric difference between the 5% of the heavier cut and the95% of the lighter cut is positive. An OVERLAP is when this difference is negative.
The ASTM gap and overlaps are used as a measure of fractionation. Packie ( Am Inst
Chem Eng Transactions V ol 317 )1941 has related a series of Gaps and overlaps to
the 50% temperature difference between the vapors rising through a distillation tray
and the liquid leaving. These series of curves are related to gaps and overlaps togive a product of reﬂux times number of trays. The series of curves have also beenconstructed for a ‘ No steam system’and ‘ Maximum steam system’ . Two of thesecurves are shown under section “ F” preceding.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1167
Gas-reﬁnery fuel
The gas fractions in petroleum reﬁning may be taken as that fraction on crude or
produced in a process as boiling below propane. This vapor fraction is usually usedas a fuel to the reﬁnery’ s ﬁred heaters. The heaters themselves have burners on dualheating source, either fuel oil or fuel gas. The pilot ﬂames on all the heater burnerassemblies are on fuel gas.
The fuel gas is the collection of the vapors from the appropriate overhead distillation
condensers, purge gas streams (from the hydro-treating processes), and any other con-tinuous hydrocarbon gas stream meeting the fuel gas criteria. Emergency venting andstart up purge streams are routed to the reﬁnery ﬂare system. The fuel gas streams arestored in bullets with heating coils to vaporize the heavier components in the mixture(i.e., butanes and occasionally pentanes). With the introduction of the ‘ clean air act’the fuel gas stream must be treated for the removal of sulfur. This is accomplishedby absorption of the sulfur components (hydrogen sulﬁde, and possibly mercaptans)into amine solutions or other absorbents. See the item on gas treating in Chapters 10and 15.
Gas oil"
"Usually there will be two gas oil side streams, a light gas oil side stream and, below this
take off, a heavy gas oil side stream. Both these side streams are steam stripped to meettheir respective ﬂash point speciﬁcation (usually 150
◦F minimum). The lighter side
stream cut of about 480–610◦F on crude) is the principal precursor for the automotive
diesel grade ﬁnished product, this side stream is desulfurized to meet the diesel sulfurspeciﬁcation in a hydrotreater (see Chapter 8). The lower gas oil stream is really aguard stream to correct the diesel distillation end point. This heavy gas oil may alsobe hydrodesulfurized and routed to either the fuel oil pool (as a precursor for marinediesel for example) or to a ﬁnished heating oil product from the gas oil pool. See alsoChapter 2.
Gasolines
These are probably among the most important and controversial reﬁnery products.
This is due to the fact that they are readily and widely used by the general public andare growing more and more in demand as the automobile industry expands. With thisexpansion in demand and their use as fuels, augmented are those problems associatedwith their effect on the environment and the health hazards due to emission fromvehicles. These have become major concerns in most highly developed countries ofthe world.1168 CHAPTER 19
Two major gasoline products are produced in the petroleum reﬁnery. Their speciﬁca-
tion and standard quality are fully described and discussed in Chapters 2, 9, and 15.The two grades shipped from reﬁneries are usually a regular grade with an octanenumber of 87 and a premium grade with an octane number of 93. These octane levelsmay differ slightly from country to country, but these are the key quality for NorthAmerica, with octane numbers deﬁned as (RON +MON)/2.
Gasolines are processed from the catalytic reforming of a heavy straight run naphtha190–360
◦F cut. This cut is the bottom product of a naphtha splitter which takes as
fee the de-butanized overhead distillate from the crude unit. The top distillate productfrom this splitter will be a light straight run naphtha. This will be blended with othercomponents (such as the reformate, catalytic cracked naphtha, and other octane)enhancement cuts to make the speciﬁed two gasoline reﬁnery products.
The catalytic reformer is run to make a 91–100 octane number research reformate
after the removal of butanes and lighter. Prior to the clean air of the 1960s, tetra ethyllead was used extensively as an octane enhancer, and the reformer operating severityin terms of octane number was much reduced. The clean air act prohibits the useof the lead compound and now only lead free gasoline is used in all vehicles. Morestringent controls are becoming to the fore in environmental controls in most of thedeveloped countries. Among these are the further reduction of sulfur compoundsin gasoline and perhaps even more important the reduction of aromatic compoundsin the products. The development of higher blending stock such as the oxygenatedgasoline and the increased production and use of parafﬁn isomers make this a verypossible achievement. These are detailed in Chapter 9 and Chapter 15.
Gas treating processes
Reﬁnery gas treating usually refers to the process used to remove the so called ‘ Acid
Gasses’ which are hydrogen sulﬁde and carbon dioxide from the reﬁnery gas streams.These acid gas removal processes used in the reﬁnery are required either to purify a gasstream for further use in a process or for environmental reasons associated with the useof the gas for fuel. Clean air legislation now being practiced through most industrialcountries requires the removal of these acid gases to very low concentrations in allgaseous efﬂuent to the atmosphere. Hydrogen sulﬁde combines with the atmosphereto form very dilute sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid both of whichare considered injurious to personal health. These compounds also cause excessivecorrosion to metals and metallic objects and may contribute to “ global warming.”
The use of chemically “ basic”liquids to react with the acidic gases was devel-
oped in 1930. The chemical used initially was tri-ethanolamine (TEA). However inmore recent times as mono-ethanolamine (MEA) has become commercially the moreA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1169
available and preferred liquid reactant due to its high acid gas absorbency on a unit
basis. Numerous alternative processes to MEA have been developed. These havefewer corrosion problems and are to a large extent more energy efﬁcient. Inhibitorsystems have however been developed which have eliminated much of the MEA cor-rosion problems. Some of these newer processes also are designed to remove the H
2S
leaving the CO 2to remain in the gas stream.
In an amine treating unit sour gas (rich in H 2S) enters the bottom of the trayed absorber"
"(or contactor). Lean amine is introduced at the top tray of the absorber section to movedown the column. Contact between the gas and amine liquid on the trays results inthe H
2S in the gas being absorbed into the amine. The sweet gas is water washed to
remove any entrained amine before leaving the top of the contactor.
Rich amine leaves the bottom of the contactor to enter a surge drum. If the contactor
pressure is high enough a ﬂash stream of H 2S can be routed from the drum to a trayed
stripper. The liquid from the drum is preheated before entering a stripping column onthe top stripping tray. This stripper is reboiled with 50 psig saturated steam. Saturated50 psig steam is used because higher temperatures cause amines to break down. TheH
2S is stripped off and leaves the reﬂux drum usually to a sulfur production plant.
Sulfur is produced in this plant by burning H 2S with a controlled air stream. The lean
amine leaves the stripper bottom and is cooled. The cooled stream is routed to thecontactor.
There are several liquid solvents in commercial use for the removal of H
2S and CO 2
from reﬁnery gases. Among the more common are the amines. These include:
MEA — Mono-ethanolamine
DEA — Di-ethanolamineDGA — Di-glycolamine
In addition to these amine base solvents there are also the hot potassium carbonate
process (Benﬁeld), Sulﬁnol and ADIP . These latter two processes are marketed bythe Shell company and are quite common in world wide usage. Full details of themore common of these compounds together with the reaction mechanism are givenin Chapter 10. A comparison of these compounds and their properties are given inTable 19.G.1.
Grids
Grids are used as low pressure drop packing in certain fractionation towers. They
came into prominence with the development of the crude oil ‘ dry vacuum’units. SeeChapter 3 and Chapter 18 for details of this type of packing and its use.1170 CHAPTER 19

Heaters
Heaters are used extensively in petroleum reﬁning to provide heat energy to the process
plants utilizing an independent energy source namely fuel oil or fuel gas. Generallyﬁred heaters fall into two major categories:
rHorizontal type
rVertical type
The horizontal type heater usually means a box type heater with the tubes run-ning horizontally along the walls. Vertical type is normally a cylindrical heaterA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1171
containing vertical tubes. Figures 18.47 and 18.48 show examples of these two types
of heaters.
Cylindrical heaters require less plot space and are usually less expensive. They also
have better radiant symmetry than the horizontal type.
Horizontal box types are preferred for crude oil heaters, although vertical cylindrical
have been used in this service. Vacuum unit heaters should have horizontal tubes toeliminate the static head pressure at the bottom of vertical tubes and to reduce thepossibility of two-phase slugging in the large exit tubes.
Occasionally, several different services (“ coils” ) may be placed in a single heater with
a cost saving. This is possible if the services are closely tied to each other in the process.Catalytic reforming preheater and reheaters in one casing is an example. Reactorheater and stripper reboiler in one casing is another example. This arrangement ismade possible by using a refractory partition wall to separate the radiant coils. Theseparate radiant coils may be controlled separately over a wide range of conditions bymeans of their own controls and burners. If a convection section is used, it is usuallycommon to the several services. If maintenance on one coil is required, the entireheater must be shut down. Also, the range of controllability is less than with separateheaters.
Full details of the two types of heaters are given in Chapter 18 of this book. This
includes the mandatory codes that apply to all ﬁred heaters for their fabrication andoperation.
Heater burners"
"Gas burners. The two most common types of gas burners are the “ pre-mix” and the
“raw gas” burners. Premix burners are preferred because they have better “ linearity” ,
i.e., excess air remains almost constant at turndown. With this type, most of the air is
drawn in through an adjustable “ air register” and mixes with the fuel in the furnaceﬁrebox. This is called secondary air. A small part of the air is drawn in throughthe “ primary air register” and mixed with the fuel in a tube before it ﬂows into thefurnace ﬁrebox. A turndown of 10:1 can be achieved with 25 psig hydrocarbon fuels.A more normal turndown is 3 : 1.
Oil burners. An oil burner “ gun”consists of an inner tube through which the oil
ﬂows and an outer tube for the atomizing agent, usually steam. The oil sprays through
an oriﬁce into a mixing chamber. Steam also ﬂows through oriﬁces into the mixingchamber. An oil-steam emulsion is formed in the mixing chamber and then ﬂows1172 CHAPTER 19
through oriﬁces in the burner tip and then out into the furnace ﬁrebox. The tip,
mixing chamber, and inner and outer tubes can be disassembled for cleaning.
Oil pressure is normally about 140–150 psig at the burner, but can be lower or higher.
Lower pressure requires larger burner tips, the pressure of the available atomizingsteam may determine the oil pressure.
Atomizing steam should be at least 100 psig at the burner valve and at least 20–30 psi
above the oil pressure. Atomizing steam consumption will be about 0.15–0.25 lbssteam/lb oil, but the steam lines should be sized for 0.5.
Combination burners. This type of burner will burn either gas or oil. It is better if
they are not operated to burn both fuels at the same time because the chemistry of
gas combustion is different from that of oil combustion. Gases burn by progressiveoxidation and oils by cracking. If gas and oil are burned simultaneously in the sameburner, the ﬂame volume will be twice that of either fuel alone.
Pilots. Pilots are usually required on oil ﬁred heaters. Pilots are ﬁred with fuel gas
and are not required when heaters are gas ﬁred only, but minimum ﬂow bypasses
around the fuel gas control valves are used to prevent the automatic controls fromextinguishing burner ﬂames.
More details on ﬁred heater burners are given in Chapter 18 of this Handbook.
Heater efﬁciencies
The efﬁciency of a ﬁred heater is the ratio of the heat absorbed by the process ﬂuid
to the heat released by combustion of the fuel expressed as a percentage. Heat re-lease may be based on the LHV (Lower Heating Value) of the fuel or HHV (HigherHeating Value). Process heaters are usually based on LHV and boilers on HHV . TheHHV efﬁciency is lower than the LHV efﬁciency by the ratio of the two heatingvalues.
Heat is wasted from a ﬁred heater in two ways:
rwith the hot stack gas
rby radiation and convection from the setting
The major loss is by the heat contained in the stack gas. The temperature of the stack
gas is determined by the temperature of the incoming process ﬂuid unless an airpreheater is used. The closest economical approach to process ﬂuid is about 100
◦F.
If the major process stream is very hot at the inlet, it may be possible to ﬁnd a colderprocess stream to pass through the convection section to improve efﬁciency, providedA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1173
plant control, and ﬂexibility are adequately provided for. A more common method
of improving efﬁciency is to generate and/or superheat steam and preheat boiler feedwater.
The lowest stack temperature that can be used is determined by the dew point of the
stack gases. Figures 18.49 and 18.50 may be used to estimate ﬂue gas heat loss.
The loss to ﬂue gas is expressed as a percentage of the total heat of combustion
available from the fuel. These ﬁgures also show the effect of excess air on efﬁciency.Typically excess air for efﬁciency guarantees is 20% when ﬁring fuel gas and 30%when ﬁring oil.
Heat loss from the setting, called radiation loss, is about 1
1/2–2% of the heat release.
The range of efﬁciencies is approximately as follows:
Very high — 90%+. Large boilers and process heaters with air preheaters.
High — 85%. Large heaters with low process inlet temperatures
and/or air preheaters.
Usual — 70–80%.
Low — 60% and less. All radiant.
More detailed discussion on this subject is given in Chapter 18 of this Handbook.
Heat exchangers
Heat exchange is the science that deals with the rate of heat transfer between hot and
cold bodies. There are three methods of heat transfer, they are:
rConduction
rConvection
rRadiation
In a heat exchanger heat is transferred by conduction and convection with conductionusually being the limiting factor. The equipment used in heat exchanger service isdesigned speciﬁcally for the duty required of it. That is, heat exchange equipmentcannot be purchased as a stock item for a service but has to be designed for thatservice.
The types of heat exchange equipment used in the process industry and their selection"
"for use are as follows:
The shell and tube exchanger. This is the type of exchanger most commonly used in a
process plant. It consists of a bundle of tubes encased in a shell. It is inexpensive and1174 CHAPTER 19
is easy to clean and maintain. There are several types of shell and tube exchangers
and some of these have removable bundles for easier cleaning. The shell and tubeexchanger has a wide variety of service that it is normally used for. These includevapor condensation (condensers), process liquid cooling (coolers), exchange of heatbetween two process streams (heat exchangers), and reboilers (boiling in fractionatorservice).
The double pipe exchanger. A double pipe exchanger consists of a pipe within a pipe.
One of the ﬂuid streams ﬂows through the inner pipe while the other ﬂows through
the annular space between the pipes. The exchanger can be dismantled very easilyand therefore be easily cleaned. The double pipe exchanger is used for very smallprocess units or where the ﬂuids are extremely fouling. Either true concurrent orcountercurrent ﬂows can be obtained but because the cost per square foot is relativelyhigh it can only be justiﬁed for special applications.
Extended surface or ﬁn tubes. This type of exchanger is similar to the double pipe
but the inner pipe is grooved or has longitudinal ﬁns on its outside surface. Its most
common use is in the service where one of the ﬂuids has a high resistance to heattransfer and the other ﬂuid has a low resistance to heat transfer. It can rarely be justiﬁedif the equivalent surface area of a shell and tube exchanger is greater than 200–300sqft.
Finned air coolers. These are the more common type of air coolers used in the process
industry. In a great many applications and geographic areas they have considerable
economic advantage over the conventional water cooling. Indeed today it is uncommonto see process plants of any reasonable size without air coolers.
Air coolers consist of a fan and one or more heat transfer sections mounted on a
frame. In most cases these sections consist of ﬁnned tubes through which the hot ﬂuidpasses. The fan located either above or below the tube section induces or forces airaround the tubes of the section.
The selection of air coolers over shell and tube is one of cost. Usually air coolers ﬁnd
favor in condensing fractionator overheads to temperatures of about 90–100
◦F and
process liquid product streams to storage temperatures. Air coolers are widely usedin most areas of the world where ambient air temperatures are mostly below 90
◦F. A t
atmospheric temperatures above 100◦F humidiﬁers are incorporated into the cooler
design and operation. The cost under these circumstances is greatly increased andtheir use is often not justiﬁed.
In very cold climates the air temperature around the tubes is controlled to avoid the
skin temperature of the ﬂuid being cooled falling below a freezing criteria or in thecase of petroleum products its pour point. This control is achieved by louvers installedA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1175
to recirculate the air ﬂow or by varying the quantity of air ﬂow by changing the fan
pitch.
Box coolers. These are the simplest form of heat exchange. However, they are generally
less efﬁcient, more costly and require a large area of the plant plot. They consist of a
single coil or “ worm” submerged in a bath of cold water. The ﬂuid ﬂows through thecoil to be cooled by the water surrounding it. The box cooler found use in the olderpetroleum reﬁneries for cooling heavy residuum to storage temperatures. Modern daypractice is to use a tempered water system where the heavy oil is cooled on the shellside of a shell and tube exchanger against water at a controlled temperature ﬂowingin the tube side. The water is recycled through an air cooler to control its temperatureto a level which will not cause the skin temperature of the oil in the shell and tubeexchanger to fall below its pour point.
Direct contact condensers. In this exchanger the process vapor to be condensed comes
into direct contact with the cooling medium (usually water). This contact is made in
a packed section of a small tower. The most common use for this type of condenseris in vacuum producing equipment. Here the vapor and motive steam for each ejectorstage is condensed in a packed direct contact condenser. This type has a low pressuredrop which is essential for the vacuum producing process.
Details of these heat exchange equipment are given in Chapter 18 of this Handbook.Basic heat transfer equations. The following equations deﬁne the basic heat transfer
relationships.These equations are used to determine the overall surface area required for the transfer
of heat from a hot source to a cold source.
The overall heat transfer equation;
The principal equation for heat transfer is given as:

subscripts “ o” and “ i” refer to outside surface and inside surface, respectively.
Flow arrangements. The two more common ﬂow paths are concurrent and counter-
current. In concurrent ﬂow both the hot ﬂuid and the cold ﬂuid ﬂow in the same
direction. This is the least desirable of the ﬂow arrangement and is only used in thosechemical processes where there is a danger of the cooling ﬂuid congealing, subliming,or crystallizing at near ambient temperatures.
Countercurrent ﬂow is the most desirable arrangement. Here the hot ﬂuid enters at
one end of the exchanger and the cold ﬂuid enters at the opposite end. The streamsﬂow in opposite directions to one another. This arrangement allows the two streamsexit temperatures to approach one another.
Logarithmic mean temperature difference /Delta1t
m.In either countercurrent or concurrent
ﬂow arrangement the log mean temperature difference used in the overall heat transfer
equation is determined by the following expression:
/Delta1tm=/Delta1t1−/Delta1t2
loge/bracketleftbigg/Delta1t1
/Delta1t2/bracketrightbigg
The/Delta1t’ s are the temperature differences at each end of the exchanger and /Delta1t1is the
larger of the two. In true countercurrent ﬂow the /Delta1tmcalculated can be used directly
in the overall heat transfer equation. However such a situation is not common and truecountercurrent ﬂow rarely exists. Therefore a correction factor needs to be appliedto arrive at the correct /Delta1t
m. These are given in Figure 18.A.1 in the appendix to
Chapter 9. Details of the shell and tube exchangers including the following:
rChoice of tube side or shell side ﬂuid
rCalculation methods
rShell and tube bafﬂing
rTypes of shell and tube exchangers (ﬁxed sheet, ﬂoating head etc.)
are also given in Chapter 18.
Air coolers and condensers. Air cooling of process streams or condensing of process
vapors is more widely used in the process industry than cooling or condensing byA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1177
exchange with cooling water. The use of individual air coolers for process streams
using modern design techniques has economized in plant area required. It has alsomade obsolete those large cooling towers and ponds associated with product cooling.
As in the case for shell and tube exchangers there are many excellent computer
programs that can be used for the design of air coolers. A method given in Chapter 9for such calculation may be used in the absence of a computer program or for a goodestimate of a unit.
A general description and diagrams of the two types of air coolers which are forced
air ﬂow and induced air ﬂow has already been given under item “ Air Coolers” earlierin this part of the Handbook.
Thermal rating. Thermal rating of an air cooler is similar in some respects to that for
a shell and tube described in the previous item. The basic energy equation
Q=U/Delta1TA
is used to determine the surface area required. The calculation for U is different in
that it requires the calculation for the air side ﬁlm coefﬁcient. This ﬁlm coefﬁcient isusually based on an extended surface area which is formed by adding ﬁns to the baresurface of the tubes. Thermal rating, surface area, fan dimensions, and horsepowerare calculation are given in full in Chapter 18 of this Handbook.
Condensers. In petroleum reﬁning and most other chemical process plants vapors are
condensed either in the shell side of a shell and tube exchanger, the tube side of an air
cooler, or by direct contact with the coolant in a packed tower. By far the most commonof these operations are the ﬁrst two listed. In the case of the shell and tube condenserthe condensation may be produced by cooling the vapor by heat exchange with a coldprocess stream or by water. Air cooling has overtaken the shell and tube condenserin the case of water as coolant in popularity as described in the previous item.
In the design or performance analysis of condensers the procedure for determining
thermal rating and surface area is more complex than that for a single phase coolingand heating. In condensers there are three mechanisms to be considered for the ratingprocedure. These are:
rThe resistance to heat transfer of the condensing ﬁlm
rThe resistance to heat transfer of the vapor cooling
rThe resistance to heat transfer of the condensate ﬁlm cooling"
"Each of these mechanisms is treated separately and along preselected sections of theexchanger. The procedure for determining the last two of the mechanisms followsthat described earlier for single phase heat transfer. The following expression is used1178 CHAPTER 19
to calculate the ﬁlm coefﬁcient for the condensing vapor:

kf=Thermal conductivity of condensate at ﬁlm temperature.

Again there are many excellent computer programs that calculate condenser thermal
ratings, and these of course save the tedium of the manual calculation.
As in the case of the shell and tube exchanger and the air cooler a manual calculation
for condensers is described in Chapter 18 of this Handbook. Again this is done toprovide some understanding of the data required to size such a unit and its signiﬁcancein the calculation procedure. Computer aided designs should however be used for thesecalculations whenever possible.
Heavy oil cracking
Up to the late 1980s feedstock to FCCU were limited by characteristics such as high
Conradson carbon and metals. This excluded the processing of the “ bottom of thebarrel” residues. Indeed, even the processing of vacuum gas oil feeds was limited to
Conradson carbon <10 wt%
hydrogen content <11.2 wt%
metals N1 +V<50 ppm
During the late 1980s signiﬁcant research and development breakthroughs have pro-
duced a catalytic process that can handle residuum feed.
Feed stocks heavier than vacuum gas oil in conventional FCCU tend to increase the
production of coke and this in turn deactivates the catalyst. This is mainly the resultof:
rA high portion of the feed that does not vaporize. The unvaporized portion quicklycokes on the catalyst choking its active area.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1179
rThe presence of high concentrations of polar molecules such as poly-cyclic aro-
matics and nitrogen compounds. These are absorbed into the catalyst’ s active areacausing instant (but temporary) deactivation.
rHeavy metals contamination that poison the catalyst and affect the selectivity of thecracking process.
rHigh concentration of poly-naphthenes that dealkylate slowly.
In FCCU that process conventional feedstocks cracking temperature is controlled bythe circulation of hot regenerated catalyst. With the heavier feedstocks an increase inConradson carbon will lead to a larger coke formation. This in turn produces a highregenerated catalyst temperature and heat load. To maintain heat balance thereforecatalyst circulation is reduced leading to poor or unsatisfactory performance. Catalystcooling or feed cooling is used to overcome this high catalyst heat load and to maintainproper circulation.
The extended boiling range of the feed as in the case of residues tends to cause an
uneven cracking severity. The lighter molecules in the feed are instantly vaporizedon contact with the hot catalyst, and cracking occurs. In the case of the heaviermolecules vaporization is not achieved so easily. This contributes to a higher cokedeposition with a higher rate of catalyst deactivation. Ideally the whole feed should beinstantly vaporized so that a uniform cracking mechanism can commence. The mix
temperature (which is deﬁned as the theoretical equilibrium temperature between the
uncracked vaporized feed and the regenerated catalyst) should be close to the feeddew point temperature. In conventional units this is about 20–30
◦C above the riser
outlet temperature. This can be approximated by the expression:
TM=TR+0.1 Delta H C
where
TM=the mix temperature
TR=riser outlet temperature◦C
Delta H C=heat of cracking in kJ/kg
This mix temperature is also slightly dependent on the catalyst temperature.
Cracking severity is affected by poly-cyclic aromatics and nitrogen. This is so
because these compounds tend to be absorbed into the catalyst. Rising the mixtemperature by increasing the riser temperature reverses the absorption process.Unfortunately, a higher riser temperature leads to undesirable thermal cracking andproduction of dry gas.
The processing of resid feedstocks therefore requires special techniques to overcome:
rFeed vaporization
rHigh concentration of polar molecules
rPresence of metals1180 CHAPTER 19
Some of the techniques developed to meet heavy oil cracking processing are as
follows:
rTwo stage regeneration
rRiser mixer design and mix temperature control (for rapid vaporization)
rNew riser lift technology minimizing the use of steam
rRegen catalyst temperature control (catalyst cooling)
rCatalyst selection for:➢Good conversion and yield pattern
➢Metal resistance
➢Thermal and hydrothermal resistance
➢High gasoline RON"
"Conventional ﬂuid catalytic crackers can be revamped to incorporate the featuresnecessary for heavy oil (residual) cracking.
An important issue in the case of deep oil (residue) cracking is the handling of the
high coke lay down and the protection of the catalyst. One technique that limits thesevere conditions in regeneration of the spent catalyst is the two stage regeneration.Figure 11.11 in Chapter 11 shows this conﬁguration.
The spent catalyst from the reactor is delivered to the ﬁrst regenerator. Here the
catalyst undergoes a mild oxidation with a limited amount of air. Temperatures in thisregeneration remain fairly low around 700–750
◦C range. From this ﬁrst regeneration
the catalyst is pneumatically conveyed to a second regenerator. Here excess air is usedto complete the carbon burn off and temperatures up to 900
◦C are experienced. The
regenerated catalyst leaves this second regeneration to return to the reactor via the riser.
The technology that applies to the two stage regeneration process is innovative in
that it achieves burning off the high coke without impairing the catalyst activity.In the ﬁrst stage the conditions encourage the combustion of most of the hydrogenassociated with the coke. A signiﬁcant amount of the carbon is also burned off undermild condition. These conditions inhibit catalyst deactivation.
All the residual coke is burned off in the second stage with excess air and in a
dry atmosphere. All the steam associated with hydrogen combustion and carry overfrom the reactor has been dispensed within the ﬁrst stage. The second regeneratoris refractory lined and there is no temperature constraint. The catalyst is allowed tocome to equilibrium. Even at high regen temperatures under these conditions lowercatalyst deactivation is experienced. The two stage regeneration technique leads toa better catalyst regeneration as well as a lower catalyst consumption. Typically theclean catalyst contains less than 0.05 wt% of carbon. This is achieved with an overalllower heat of combustion. Full details of this concept are given in Chapter 11. Sincethe unit remains in heat balance coke production stays essentially the same. TheA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1181
circulation rate of catalyst adjusts itself to any changes in coke deposition on the
catalyst according to the expressions:
coke make =delta coke +c/o
and
regenerator temperature =riser temperature +C×delta coke
where
delta coke =difference between the weight fraction of coke on the catalyst
before and after regeneration.
c=unit constant (typically 180–230)
c/o=catalyst to oil ratio
In this regard a small circulation of extremely hot catalyst may not be effective as alarge circulation of cooler catalyst. It has been found that there is a speciﬁc catalysttemperature range that is desirable for a given feed and catalyst system. A uniquedense phase catalyst cooling system provides a technique through which the besttemperature and heat balance relationship can be maintained.
Consider the enthalpy requirements for a FCC reactor given in the following table:
Per pound of feed
Btu %
Feed heating/vaporizing 530.0 69.00
Stripping steam enthalpy 5.0 0.65Feed steam for dispersion 12.7 1.65Feed water for heat balance 18.4 2.40Heat of reaction 200.0 26.04Heat loss 2.0 0.26
Total 768.1 100.00
It can be seen from this table that 69% of the enthalpy contained in the heat input to
the reactor is required just to heat and vaporize the feed. The remainder is essentiallyavailable for conversion. To improve operation it would be desirable to allow more ofthe heat available to be used for conversion. The only variable that can be changed toachieve this requirement is the feed inlet enthalpy. That is through preheating the feed.Doing this, however, immediately reduces the catalyst circulation rate to maintain heatbalance. This of course has an adverse effect on conversion. The preheating of thefeed can, however, be compensated for by cooling the catalyst. Thus the catalystcirculation rate can be retained and in many cases can be increased. Indeed, by carefulmanipulation of the heat balance the net increase in catalyst circulation rate can be ashigh as 1 unit cat/oil ratio. The higher equilibrium catalyst activity possible at the lower1182 CHAPTER 19
regeneration temperature also improves the unit yield pattern. This is demonstrated
in the following table:

In summary, catalyst cooling will:
rSlightly increase unit coke
rGive a higher plant catalyst activity
rBe able to handle more contaminated feeds
rImprove conversion and unit yield
rProvide better operating ﬂexibility
In residue cracking commercial experience indicates that operations at regenerated"
"catalyst temperatures above 1,350◦F result in poor yields with high gas production.
Where certain operations require high regenerator temperatures the installation of acatalyst cooler will have a substantial economic incentive. This will be due to improvedyields and catalyst consumption.
There are two types of catalyst coolers available. These are shown as Figure 11.14 in
Chapter 11. They are:
rThe back mix type
rFlow through type
Both coolers are installed into the dense phase section of the regenerator.
The back mix cooler. Boiler feed water ﬂows tube side in both cooler types. The
catalyst in the back mix cooler circulates around the tube bundle on the shell side.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1183
The heat transfer takes place in a dense low velocity region so erosion is minimized.
The back mix cooler can remove approximately 50 million Btu’ s/hr.
The ﬂow through cooler. As the name suggests the catalyst ﬂows once through on the
shell side of this cooler. Again erosion is minimized by low velocity operation in thedense phase. This type of cooler is more efﬁcient than the back mix. This unit canachieve heat removal as high as 100 million Btu’ s per hour.
Mix temperature control and lift gas technology. The equilibrium temperature between
the oil feed and the regenerated catalyst must be reached in the shortest possible time.
This is required in order to ensure the rapid and homogeneous vaporization of the feed.To ensure this it is necessary to design and install a proper feed injection system. Thissystem should ensure that any catalyst back mixing is eliminated. It should also ensurethat all the vaporized feed components are subject to the same cracking severity.
Efﬁcient mixing of the feed ﬁnely atomized in small droplets is achieved by con-
tact with a preaccelerated dilute suspension of the regenerated catalyst. Under theseconditions feed vaporization takes place almost instantaneously. This conﬁgurationis shown in the diagram below:1184 CHAPTER 19
The regen catalyst stream from the regenerator is accelerated by steam or lift gas
injection to move up the riser. The oil feed is introduced atomized by steam into thecatalyst environment. The main motive steam into the riser is introduced below thefeed inlet point. Good mixing occurs in this section with maximum contact betweenoil, catalyst, and the steam.
In residue cracking the proper selection of catalyst enables even the most bulky
molecules to reach the active catalyst zone. Such zeolite catalyst have a high silicato alumna ratio which cracks the heavy molecules into sizes that can enter the activezone.
Efﬁcient mixing of the catalyst and feed together with the catalyst selection en-
sures:
rRapid vaporization of the oil
rUniform cracking severity of the oil
Another problem that is met within residue cracking is the possibility of the heavierportion of the oil being below its dew point. The presence of poly-cyclic aromaticsalso affects cracking severity. Increasing the mix temperature to the riser temperaturereverses the effect of poly-cyclic aromatics. In so doing, however, thermal crackingoccurs which is undesirable. To solve this problem it is necessary to be able to con-trol riser temperature independently of mix temperature. Mix Temperature Control(MTC) is achieved by injecting a suitable heavy cycle oil stream into the riser abovethe oil feed injection point. This essentially separates the riser into two reaction zones.The ﬁrst is between the feed injection and the cycle oil inlet. This zone is character-ized by a high mix temperature, a high catalyst to oil ratio and a very short contacttime.
The second zone above the cycle oil inlet operates under more conventional catalytic
cracking conditions. The riser temperature is maintained independently by the intro-duction of the regenerated catalyst. Thus an increase in cycle oil leads to a decreasein riser temperature, which introduces more catalyst, increases the mix temperature,and the catalyst to oil ratio, and decreases the regenerator temperature.
The lift gas technology. As described earlier it is highly desirable to achieve good
catalyst / oil mixing as early and as quickly as possible. The method described to
achieve this requires the preacceleration and dilution of the catalyst stream. Tradi-tionally steam was the medium used to maintain catalyst bed ﬂuidity and movement inthe riser. Steam, however, has deleterious effects on the very hot catalyst that is usedin residue cracking processes. Steam under these conditions causes hydrothermaldeactivation of the catalyst.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1185
Much work has been done in reducing the use of steam in contact with the hot catalyst."
"Some of the results of the work showed that if the partial pressure of steam is keptlow, the hydrothermal effects are greatly reduced, in the case of relatively metal freecatalyst. A more important result of the work showed that light hydrocarbons impartedfavorable conditioning effects to the freshly regenerated catalyst. This was even morepronounced in catalysts that were heavily contaminated with metals.
Light hydrocarbon gases have been introduced in several heavy oil crackers since
1985. They have operated either with lift gas alone or mixed with steam. The lim-itations to the use of lift gas rests on the ability of downstream units to handle theadditional gas. The following table compares the effect of lift gas in resid operationwith the use of steam.

Hot and cold ﬂash separators
Hot and cold ﬂash separation are used in high pressure, high temperature hydro
cracking processes. The principal purpose is to recover high purity hydrogen forrecycle in as economically a manner as possible. Secondly, as the high temperature1186 CHAPTER 19
and pressure cracker efﬂuent is to be further processed, it is desirable to route the
ﬂashed liquid at as high a temperature as possible to the subsequent process unit.
Figure 11.15 of Chapter 11 of this Handbook shows the general conﬁguration of a
residue hydrocracker and visbreaking combination unit.
Bitumen feed from a crude vacuum distillation unit enters the reaction section of the
hydro-cracker to be preheated by hot ﬂash vapors in a shell and tube exchanger. Arecycle and make up hydrogen stream is similarly heated by exchange with hot ﬂashvapors. The hydrogen stream is mixed with the hot bitumen stream before enteringthe hydro-cracker heater. The feed streams are risen to the reactor temperature in theheater and leave to enter the top of the reactor vessel. The feed streams ﬂow downwardsthrough the catalyst beds contained in the reactor. Additional cold hydrogen is injectedat various sections of the reactor to provide temperature control as the hydro-crackingprocess is exothermal.
The reactor efﬂuent leaves the reactor to enter a hot ﬂash drum. Here the heavy
bituminous portion of the efﬂuent leaves from the bottom of the drum while thelighter oil and gas phase leaves as a vapor from the top of the drum. This vapor issubsequently cooled by heat exchange with the feed and further cooled and partiallycondensed by an air cooler. This cooled stream then enters a cold separator operatingat a pressure only slightly lower than that of the reactor. A rich hydrogen gas streamis removed from this drum to be amine treated and returned as recycle gas to theprocess. The distillate liquid leaves from the bottom of the separator to join a vaporstream from the hot ﬂash surge drum (visbreaker feed surge drum). Both these streamsenter the cold ﬂash drum which operates at a much lower pressure than the upstreamequipment. A gas stream is removed from the drum to be routed to the absorber ina distillate hydro-cracking unit. The liquid distillate from the drum is routed to thede-butanizer in the distillate hydro-cracking unit.
The visbreaker section of the unit takes as feed the heavy bituminous liquid from
the hot ﬂash drum. This enters the visbreaker furnace via a surge drum. The vis-breaker heater has two parallel coils. The oil feed enters these coils to be thermallycracked to form some lighter products. The stream leaving the heater is quenchedbefore entering a ﬂash chamber. This vessel contains some bafﬂed trays and a lightgas and oil vapor stream leaves overhead. This stream is subsequently cooled andthe distillate formed routed to the cold ﬂash drum. The bottoms from the ﬂashchamber may be fed to a visbreaker vacuum distillation unit where vacuum gas oilcan be removed as feed to a ﬂuid catalytic cracker unit. Alternatively this bottomproduct may be simply routed to an asphalt plant for suitable feed to an asphalt airblower or simple blended with cut-back material for marketable asphalt.

Hydraulic analysis of process systems
This item deals with calculating a pressure proﬁle of a process system. Such a cal-"
"culation is used to size pipelines and to determine the pumping requirements for thesystem. The following calculation is an example of a typical system process engineersencounter in a design of a plant or in checking out an operating plant’ s process ﬂow.The attached diagram H5 is used as the basis for this example.

rangement drawing (a piping GA). For this calculation this information is ﬁctional:
Number of standard elbows in the line =8.
Number of gate valves (all open) in the line =3
Total straight length of 10/prime/primeline=85 ft.

2.0 Control valve pressure drop
There is a battery limit Level Control Valve (LICV) between E-109 and the BL It is
required to calculate the pressure drop for this valve at design ﬂow. The rule of thumbgiven in Chapter 1.9 will be used to determine this. Thus, the pressure drop will beestimated as 20% of the circuit frictional pressure drop plus 10% of the static head ofthe receiving vessel.
The oil discharges into a surge drum of another downstream unit. This drum is pres-
surized by a blanket of inert gas. The net static head to this drum is 15 ft above valveoutlet ﬂange. This is equivalent to 6 psi.
The total line pressure drop for the whole circuit is estimated at 3 times that calculated
above. (This will be checked and may be revised when the analysis of the whole circuitis complete). This pressure drop therefore is 3 ×3.86=11.58 psi for line losses. In
addition to this line loss there are also two air coolers which have pressure drops asfollows:
E-109 =6 psi (from data sheets).
E-110 =8 psi
Then total system pressure drop is estimated as:
11.58+14=25.58 psi.

Hydro-cracking (distillate)
Details of this process are given in Chapter 7. The following section is a de-
scription of a typical distillate hydro-cracker having a crude vacuum distillate asfeed.
The diagram (Figure 19.H.2) shows a typical hydro-cracking unit in which the fresh
feed is pumped through a series of feed/efﬂuent exchangers to the inlet of the ﬁrstreactor. The preheated feed is mixed with hot recycle gas at the inlet to the ﬁrstreactor. In this case only the recycle gas passes through the ﬁred heater although insome processes the combined feed and recycle gas are heated. The ﬁrst reactor is1194 CHAPTER 19
Figure 19.H.2. A distillate hydro cracker.
usually ﬁlled with a hydro-treating catalyst for the partial de-sulfurization and de-
nitrogenation of the fresh feed. The catalyst employed for the hydro-treating is analumna based type containing cobalt and molybdenum. To protect the catalyst fromfouling by iron compounds and any salt in the feedstock, the ﬁrst few feet of the reactoris usually used as a guard bed— some processes utilize an external guard reactor.
The hydrogenated feedstock is then mixed with additional hydrogen and passes to
the hydro-cracking reactor, where cracking to the desired products takes place. Thenumber of hydro-cracking reactor stages will either be one or two depending uponthe products required.
The hydro-cracker reactor efﬂuent is cooled by exchange with fresh feed and recycle
hydrogen and is then ﬂashed in the high pressure separator. The liquid from the highpressure separator passes to a further low pressure separator whilst the gas stream,which is rich in hydrogen, is recycled to the reactors. Make up hydrogen is added asrequired.
The liquid from the low pressure separator is then pumped to the fractionation train
where products are separated. The unconverted portion of the fresh feed may theneither be recycled for further cracking or used as product. Flash gas from the lowA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1195
pressure separator is usually treated to remove the acidic components before being
sent to the reﬁnery fuel gas system.
Typical feeds include atmospheric and vacuum virgin gas oils, catalytic cycle oils,
deasphalted oil, coker gas oil, thermal gas oil, and parafﬁn rafﬁnates. Heavy feedstocks such as vacuum gas oils are usually limited to an end point of about 1,050
◦F."
"Products range from LPG, naphtha, gasoline through to lube oils; the more usualbeing naphtha, gasoline, and diesel fuel. It is possible to vary the products froma hydro-cracking unit by merely changing the reactor operating conditions and thefractionation cut point. This ﬂexibility of operation is one of the major factors in favorof hydro-cracking.
The overall hydro-cracking reaction is exothermal. Temperature control of the re-
actor is accomplished by the introduction of cold hydrogen quench streams at theappropriate locations in the reactor.
The hydro-cracker reactor side
This side of the hydro-cracker is licensed to oil reﬁnery clients. The data requirements
therefore are proprietary to the licensor and are provided to clients under the licensingagreement. Use and disclosure of these data are limited to the various clients and/orclient’ s engineering contractor personnel who require such data to design or operatethe process.
Operating variables are available to client personnel in the form of graphs or curves.
For example and referring to the process diagram H6 some of these would be:
R1 reactor temperature response
rEffect of feed end point and density on required temperature
rEffect of feed nitrogen content on required temperature
rEffect of temperature on R1 product nitrogen content
rEffect of feed rate on required temperature

Hydro-cracker recovery side
A block ﬂow diagram of a typical hydro-cracker product recovery is given in Fig-
ure 19.H.3.
The feed to the main fractionator contains the de-butanized efﬂuent from the hydro-
cracker reactor side and the cold ﬂash liquid. The absorber rich liquid is also fed tothe de-butanizer. This absorber rich liquid is kerosene saturated with some light gasand most of the propanes and butanes in the de-butanizer overhead gas stream.
The de-butanizer bottom stream is preheated in a ﬁred heater before entering the ﬂash
zone of the main fractionator. In this fractionator a full range naphtha stream is takenoff overhead. Kero and gas oils are taken off as the two side streams. Kero is strippedby reboiling while the gas oil is steam stripped. A small stream of unconverted oilleaves as the tower bottom product. This is returned to the reactors as recycle.
The ASTM distillation lab data for all streams, together with plant data giving their
respective ﬂows are available and can be used to develop a TBP curve for the mainfractionator feed. The procedure is given by the following steps:
Step 1. Calculate the TBP curve for light naphtha, heavy naphtha, kero, diesel, and
UCO from their respective ATSM distillation data.
Step 2. Plot each of the TBP curves as shown in Figure 19.H.4.
Step 3. Starting with the naphtha divide the TBP curve into about six boiling point
fractions.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1197
Figure 19.H.4. The TBP of the cuts.
Step 4. Divide the heavy naphtha curve in a smaller manner. In this case, however, the
cut points of the fractions in the light naphtha that are also in the heavy naphtha
must be identiﬁed. These must also be a fraction in the heavy naphtha. For exampleif the penultimate fraction of the light naphtha has a cut range 220–240
◦F , and the
heavy naphtha starts with a TBP IBP of 220◦F , then the ﬁrst fraction of the heavy
naphtha must have an IBP of 240◦F.
Step 5. Divide the kero, diesel, and UCO TBP curves in the same manner as the heavy
naphtha described in Step 4. Make sure that all common fractions are identiﬁedand measured in each product.1198 CHAPTER 19
Step 6. From the plant ﬂow data calculate the yield of each stream as a volume percent
on total feed.
Step 7. List the cut points for each fraction developed in Steps 3 through 5. Against
each cut point calculate its percentage on total feed that will be in all 5 product
streams. That is, if cut points 180–190◦F in light naphtha is 20 vol% on its TBP"
"and light naphtha is 5.06 vol% on total feed then this component with cut range to180–190
◦F will be 0.2 g× 5.06 vol% on total feed.
Step 8. Step 8 List the percent of each fraction on feed for all 5 products. Then
by adding them horizontally the total of each cut point fraction on total feed isestablished.
Step 9. Plot the cumulative volume percent from Step 8 against cut point. This is the
fractionator feed TBP curve given as Figure 19.H.5.
An example calculation now follow:

The development of the catalytic reformer and the signiﬁcant amount of hydrogen
provided by the process gave rise to the hydro skimming reﬁnery that is most common1202 CHAPTER 19
in present day petroleum reﬁning. In this type of reﬁnery the produced reformer
hydrogen stream is used as the major component for the following treating processes:
rHydro-desulfurizing
rKerosene de-aromatization
rOleﬁn saturation
rLube oil de colorization
Details of catalytic reforming are given in Chapter 5 while the major hydro-treatingprocesses are discussed in Chapter 8. The availability of hydrogen from the catalyticreformer continued to support the hydro-skimming reﬁnery comfortably until thedevelopment of the hydro-cracker process. The availability of hydrogen from thetraditional source of catalytic reﬁning fell far short both in quantity and in sustainedpurity to satisfy this new process. To overcome this shortfall in reﬁneries whoseprocess conﬁguration included hydro-cracking, Hydrocarbon conversion to hydrogenand CO were installed. The most common of these is the deep conversion of naphthaor light hydrocarbon gases. These processes contained a ﬁred reactor whose tubescontain a catalyst. The feed with a quantity of steam are introduced in this reactor.The hydrocarbon is reduced to its basic components of carbon as CO and hydrogen. Aseries of shift reactors and a methanation reactor produces the rich hydrogen streamrequired by the hydro-cracker process. As some sulfur removal is required, this isusually accomplished by traditional means (i.e., amine absorption, or hot potassiumcarbonate, or in some cases molecular sieves).
Hydro-treating
Naphtha hydro-desulfurization. This uses cat reformer hydrogen or similar on a once
through basis. Heavy naphtha feed to the cat reformer is fed to the naphtha hydro-desulfurizer from storage. The feed stream and the hydrogen gas stream are preheatedby exchange with the hot reactor efﬂuent stream. The feed then enters the ﬁred heaterwhich brings it up to the reactor temperatures (about 450
◦F) and leaves the heater to
enter the reactor which operates at about 400–450 psig. Sulfur is removed from thehydrocarbon as hydrogen sulﬁde in this reactor and the reactor efﬂuent is cooled toabout 100"
"◦F by heat exchange with the feed. The cooled efﬂuent is collected in a ﬂash
drum where the light hydrogen rich gas is ﬂashed off. This gas enters the suction sideof the booster compressor which delivers it to other hydro-treaters. The liquid phasefrom the drum is pumped to a reboiled stabilizer. The overhead vapor stream fromthe stabilizer is routed to fuel while the bottom product, cat reformer feed, is pumpedto the cat reformer.
Gas oil hydro-desulfurizer. This process uses a recycled hydrogen stream to de-
sulfurize a gas oil feed. The ﬂow sheet, Figure 19.H.6, shows the gas oil feed enteringA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1203

the unit to be preheated with hot efﬂuent stream before entering a ﬁred heater. Its
temperature is increased to the reactor temperature of about 750◦F in this heater. A
hydrogen rich stream is introduced at the coil outlet prior to the mixed streams enter-ing the reactor. The reactor contains a bed of cobalt molybdenum on alumna catalystand de-sulfurization takes place over the catalyst with 70–75% of the total sulfur inthe oil being converted to H
2S.
The reactor efﬂuent is cooled by the cold feed stream, water, or air. This cooled efﬂuententers a ﬂash drum where the gas phase and liquid phase are separated. The gas phaserich in H
2S and hydrogen enters the recycle compressor. The gas stream then enters
an amine contactor where the H 2S is absorbed into the amine and removed from
the system. Although the diagram shows a purge stream before the amine absorberin most cases the purge is down stream after the amine cleanup. The purged gas isreplaced by fresh hydrogen-rich make up stream thus maintaining the purity of therecycle gas.1204 CHAPTER 19
The liquid phase leaving the ﬂash drum is preheated before entering a stream stripping
column where the light ends created in the process are removed as overhead products.The bottom product leaves the tower to be cooled and stored.
Reactor conditions at start of run. Reactor conditions required for the proper operation
of catalytic units are dependent on the type of catalyst used. In hydro-treating therefore
reactor side conditions and operation are proprietary to the licensor of the process.However, the following data is an average and does not reﬂect any particular licensors’process.
The variables for hydro-treater operation are:
rReactor inlet temperature
rReactor pressure
rRecycle rate required
rPurity of the inlet hydrogen stream
rSpace velocity
These change with the degree of de-sulfurization required, feed cut and quality, and
the catalyst age.
There are typical conditions for the reactor side which are in the public domain:
Straight run naphtha de-sulfurization
Reactor inlet temperature — 650
◦F.
Reactor pressure — 500–600 psig
Space velocity v/v/hr — 4–6Hydrogen purity at inlet — 75% moleRecycle rate scf/bbl — 500–550
De-sulfurization to <5 ppm total sulfur.
Diesel de-sulfurization
Reactor temperature — 650
◦F
Reactor pressure — 750–1,000 psig
Space velocity v/v/hr — 1.5–2Recycle rate scf/bbl — 600–700De-sulfurization: — remove 85% sulfur in feed.
Hydrogen consumption in these units can be calculated and this depends to a large
extent only on feed quality. That is the amount of sulfur (and nitrogen in some cases)and the presence of oleﬁnic material.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1205
Predicting hydrogen consumption in naphtha hydro de-sulfurization
This item describes a method of predicting the hydrogen consumed in hydro-treating
straight run naphtha. Emphasis is based on SR naphtha. Treating cracked naphtha andgas oils need approximately three to ﬁve times the amount of hydrogen than straightrun.
The method for predicting hydrogen consumption now follows with the steps de-
scribed below:
Step 1. From the naphtha TBP and the assay estimate the weight percent sulfur in the
naphtha feed (see Item 1.4).
Step 2. Establish the throughput of the naphtha. Assume the feed will be completely
desulfurized in the process.
Step 3. Calculate the moles of sulfur removed by the chemical equation
H
2+S=H2S
Fix the moles of hydrogen required to satisfy the reaction given above. That is
moles hydrogen equals moles sulfur removed.
Step 4. Estimate the amount of hydrogen required to saturate the hydrocarbon chain or
ringafter the sulfur molecule is removed. In naphtha fractions the sulfur compounds
are relatively simple in structure. A ﬁgure of 2 or 3 times the hydrogen used forsulfur removal is reasonable for resaturation. Remember this only applies to straightrun feeds.
Step 5. The remaining consumption of hydrogen is to replace the hydrogen lost from
the system in solution with the liquid product leaving. This can be a very signiﬁcantquantity. Calculate using Steps 6 through 10.
Step 6. Establish the component analysis of the make up gas. This is usually catalytic"
"reformer off gas. Calculate the amount in moles/hr of each component that satisﬁesthe chemical reaction quantity calculated in Steps 3 and 4.
Step 7. Let x moles/hr be the hydrogen that leaves in solution with the product.
Calculate in terms of x the proportion of the other components related to thehydrogen that also leave in solution with the product. This is each component’ smoles divided by the hydrogen component and multiplied by x.
Step 8. Add the C
1through C 5’ s portion of the make up gas to the x component’ s
calculated in Step 7.
Step 9. The quantity calculated in Step 8 plus the moles of naphtha product is the liquid
phase that leaves the separator (i.e., the unstabilized product). By deﬁnition this isin equilibrium with the gas phase that leaves the separator drum. Calculate, usingthe liquid phase composition, its bubble point at the separator drum conditions.1206 CHAPTER 19
Step 10. Again by deﬁnition the y factor calculated in Step 9 (i.e., y =Kx) is the
composition of the vapor phase leaving the separator drum. As /Sigma1y=/Sigma1Kx then
equate and solve for x as moles hydrogen leaving in solution with the hydro-treated
product.
Step 11. The gas phase composition is calculated by substituting the calculate value
for x in Step 10. If the unit has a recycle gas stream, this is the composition of therecycle gas.
Step 12. The total hydrogen and hydrogen gas stream make up to the unit can now be
completed with the addition of the moles in solution calculated in Step 10.
Predicting the hydrogen consumption in gas oil hydro-treating—with gas purge
Diesel hydro-treating is in many ways similar to naphtha hydro-treating. However, be-
cause of a more complex molecular structure in the diesel fraction and more complexsulfur compounds some additional consideration must be made in this case. Therewill be a higher quantity of sulfur and these will contain disulphides and thiopheneswhich are complex ring compounds of sulfur. More light ends are made in the processwhen these compounds are broken to release the sulfur.
Because of the quantity of sulfur released as H
2S there is every probability that the
recycle gas will require amine treating to remove this H 2S and thus retain its purity.
There is also a need to purge off some of the recycle gas and replace it with fresh
catalytic reformer (or high hydrogen content gas). This will be so if the light end ishigh and the subsequent purity of the recycle gas diminished.
In this item consideration has been given to amine treating and purging the recycle.
The purging is an added item to be satisﬁed by the make up gas consumption. Themethod of predicting hydrogen consumption and recycle gas purity is given by thefollowing steps:
Step 1. From the feed TBP and assay calculate its sulfur content.
Step 2. Set the degree of de-sulfurization required. This will depend on catalyst
and reactor conditions. Most well designed modern diesel hydro-treaters can de-
sulfurize heavy gas oil to remove at least 85 wt% of its sulfur content. In the caseof automotive diesel, current requirements for ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) areexpected to bring sulfur speciﬁcations down to <50 ppm. This, however, varies
from country to country, with many still in the 300–500 ppm range or evenhigher.
Step 3. Establish the feed throughput. This will depend on the space velocity required
for Step 2.
Step 4. Estimate the light ends produced in the process. This can be done by referring
to plant records. As a rule of thumb this can be in the form of C
5+naphtha at aboutA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1207
6–10% by vol of feed. Some C 5’ s and lighter are also formed but these are usually
in small quantities.
Step 5. As in the method used for naphtha hydro-treating, calculate the hydrogen
required to remove the sulfur molecules. Again add 2 times this quantity to saturate
the compounds that contained the sulfur.
Step 6. The light ends formed through the minor cracking to release thiophenes and
disulﬁdes will need to be saturated. This consumes hydrogen. Approximately 2moles of hydrogen will be required for this purpose per mole of light ends formed.Using past lab tests on the hydro-treater naphtha develop the TBP and split topseudo components. Allocate mole weights and gravities to these components toarrive at a number of moles/hr for the light ends. Calculate the hydrogen consumpt-ion.
Step 7. The remaining hydrogen requirements will be to replace hydrogen lost in solu-
tion with the liquid product and of course that lost in the purge stream. Commencewith the calculation to determine solution loss as follows.
Step 8. Establish the component analysis of the make up gas. This is usually catalytic
reformer off gas or if the naphtha hydro-treater is operating on a once through gasbasis it will be the off gas from that unit.
Step 9. Calculate the amount in moles/hr of each component associated in the make
up gas with the hydrogen required for the chemical reactions calculated in Steps 5and 6."
"Step 10. Let x moles/hr be the hydrogen that leaves in solution with the liquid product
from the separator and the purge gas. Calculate in terms of x the proportion of theother components in the make up gas associated with the hydrogen.
Step 11. Add the C
1–C5portion of the make up gas to the x components calcu-
lated in Step 10. Add also the C 5+naphtha components which were made in the
process and of course a guess at the number of moles of H 2S that will be in the
liquid phase of the separation drum. To do this look at the “ K” (equilibrium con-stant) for H
2S at drum conditions. Use this to estimate its proportion in liquid.
For example if K =1 then the split will be close to 50% in liquid and 50% in
vapor.
Step 12. Set the amount of purge in terms of its proportion to the liquid product (that
is set the V/L for ﬂash vaporization). This will be such as to provide a recycle gashydrogen content of above 63% mole after H
2S removal. This ﬁgure is trial and
error. Start with V/L =0.1.
Step 13. Carry out a ﬂash calculation in terms of x and using V/L set in Step 12. Solve
for x. The vapor steam from this calculation is the purge gas in terms of moles/hrand composition. It also is the composition of the recycle gas.
Step 14. Complete the calculation for hydrogen consumption and make up gas using
the value for x above.
An example calculation now follows.1208 CHAPTER 19

Estimating the hydrogen consumption for oleﬁn separation
This item gives a simple method for estimating the hydrogen consumption when
treating cracked stocks. This method uses the correlation
BR number =Percent oleﬁns ×160
MW oleﬁns
Where BR number is the bromine number of the stock. This can be obtained by lab
analysis. The mole weight of the oleﬁns is estimated as 1.3 times the mole weight ofthe parafﬁn with the same mid boiling point of the cut.
The hydrogen consumption for saturation is taken at 6.5–8.0 SCF hydrogen per barrel
for every unit of bromine number reduction that occurs in the process. Brominereduction in hydro-treating is estimated as follows
LT cracked naphtha — 90–100% reduction
FCCU cycle oil — 12 unit reductionCoker gas oil — 40 unit reduction
Visbreaker gas oil — 40–45 unit reduction
Use 6.5 SCF/Bbl per bromine unit reduction for naphtha and light oil and 8.0 for theheavier feeds.
A sample calculation now follows:1212 CHAPTER 19

Oleﬁn saturation is 6.5 SCF hydrogen/Bbl per unit of bromine number reduction.
With naphtha this is usually about 95%.
Then hydrogen required =6.5×37×0.95 SCF/Bbl
=228.5 SCF/Bbl of Feed
Further details including reaction mechanism of hydro-treating are discussed and
described in Chapter 7 of this Handbook.
I
i-component
The “ i” as a preﬁx to a chemical component indicates that the compound is an isomer.
There are several isomers in petroleum reﬁning and the most common relate to thelight components of the structure. Notably these are:A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1213
iso-Butane— iC4
iso-Pentane— iC5
iso-Hexane— iC6
and so on through the homologue. When isomers exist and are quoted together with
the normal compound this normal compound will be identiﬁed by a preﬁx n.
Impeller speeds (pumps)
Two types of centrifugal pumps are used in petroleum reﬁning. One at an impeller
speed of 3,550 rpm and the other type operating at an impeller speed of 2,950 rpm.Some difference in their operating characterization are given in Table 19.I.1.
In general, centrifugal pumps should not be operated continuously at ﬂows less than
approximately 20% of the normal rating of the pump. The normal rating for thepump is the capacity corresponding to the maximum efﬁciency point. The table liststhe minimum desirable ﬂow rates which should be maintained by continuous re-circulation, if the required process ﬂow conditions are of lower magnitude: Care mustbe exercised in the design of any re-circulation system to insure that the re-circulatedﬂow does not increase the temperature of pump suction and cause increased vaporpressure and reduction of available NPSH.
For low head pumps that can operate at 1,750 or 1,450 rpm, the above normal and
minimum continuous capacities are reduced by 50%. Pump details, description anddiscussion are given in Chapter 18.

Indices
Indices are used extensively in petroleum reﬁning technology to correlate one set of
data with another. Chapters 1 and 3 provide indices that relate the properties of variouscomponents to temperature, viscosities, ﬂash point blending and the like. A numberof these indices are used in the blending of petroleum fraction to give the propertiesof the blended product. For example, the components listed in Table 19.I.2 are tobe blended in the proportions given and the viscosity of the blended product deter-mined.
Initial boiling points
Initial boiling points or IBP’ s refer to the temperature at which a petroleum cut begins"
"to boil. Usually this temperature is taken as that at atmospheric pressure. Theseare determined in the reﬁnery’ s laboratory from the ASTM distillation carried outas a routine test. Details of these tests are given in Chapter 7. Brieﬂy the initialboiling point is the temperature of the boiling liquid vapor whose ﬁrst condensatedrop enters the measuring cylinder at the condenser outlet. The IBP of the TBP curveis usually calculated from the ASTM test results in the reﬁnery. TBP curves arenot usually part of the reﬁnery test schedules but belong to the company’ s researchand development center. A similar comment applies also to the EFV curve. SeeChapter 3 for the calculation of TBP and EFV curves. The ﬁnal boiling point ofthe ASTM distillation test is the maximum temperature noted after the boiling ﬂaskhas boiled dry. Sometimes the ﬁnal boiling point (FBP) is called the ASTM endpoint.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1215
Instrumentation
The proper operation and performance of any process depends as much on a properly
designed control system and its supporting instruments as the correct design andspeciﬁcation of the equipment contained in the process.
Control systems in a process are aimed at maintaining the correct conditions of
Flow, Temperature, Pressure, and Levels in process equipment and piping. These aredescribed and discussed in detail in Chapter 13. The system covers four major typesof controls which are:
rFlow control
rTemperature control
rPressure control
rLevel control
The principal objective of all these types of controls is to maintain a steady stable plantoperation and to enable changes and emergencies to be handled safely. The systemmust also be designed to ensure that any process changes can be accommodated withminimum risk of damage to plant equipment. The instruments that support the plantcontrol system are gauges and control valves. Not all gauges have a control function;many are for plant performance record or for indication only, for example a pressuregauge on a pump discharge is there to indicate that the pump is operating correctly.A ﬂow gauge in the line as oriﬁce plate assembly indicates the ﬂow quantity (usuallyon a control room chart) and sets an associated control valve action. In the petroleumreﬁnery the major instruments are:
Flow — Oriﬁce assembly
Temperature — ThermocouplesPressure — Bourdon tube gauge, differential pressureLevel — Float type, displacer, or differential pressure type
The addition of ‘ on stream’analyzers constitutes a major instrument system, partic-
ularly if the reﬁnery operates on automated control. This is standard practice in allmajor reﬁneries.
Internals (V essels)
The purpose of vessel internals may be characterized as follows:
rTo enhance heat and mass transfer (e.g., fractionating towers)
rTo maintain proper residence time for settling (e.g., condensate drums)
rTo promote good distribution of ﬂuids (vessel inlet distributors)
rTo prevent vortexing of ﬂuids leaving vessels to pump suction1216 CHAPTER 19
A brief description of each of the vessel internals are as follows:
Heat and mass transfer is required in the operation of distillation fractionators. These
include steam (or inert gas) strippers. The method used to achieve this is to ﬁt atower with fractionating trays. With the use of a reboiler supplying heat to the towerbotton and cold reﬂux stream introduced at the tower top heat and mass transferoccurs successively on these trays. Full details, discussion and examples are givenin Chapters 3–12. For the same purpose of heat and mass transfer the trays may bereplaced with a packing, again this is described in Chapter 3 and Chapter 18. Theseinternals are also used where mass transfer only is required (e.g., some absorber units,and liquid/liquid extraction units).
A number of vessels in petroleum reﬁning are used to collect and separate immiscible
ﬂuids. The most common are fractionator overhead distillate drums. In many casesthe ﬂuid entering the drum is a mixture of hydrocarbon and water. In these cases it isnecessary to retain the mixed ﬂuid in the drum until the phases separate out. A bafﬂearrangement is used for this purpose slowing the ﬂuid ﬂow from the drum inlet tooutlet meeting the required residence time.
In many processes, particularly those that utilize trays or packing it is important that
the ﬂuid entering is evenly distributed over the tray or the packing surface. This isachieved by a carefully designed distributor pipe with slots or holes. In large packedtowers there may be several rigs of sprays covering the packing surface. In the caseof drums the ﬂuid entering is impinged on a horizontal plate to effect a curtain of theﬂuid entering the body of the drum. This enhances the separation of any vapor thatthe ﬂuid contains and separates the two phases. Most fractionator overhead condenserdrums are ﬁtted with these ‘ Splash Plates’ .
All vessels whose outlet nozzles feed directly to pump suction are ﬁtted with a vortex"
"breaker. This is simply a plate placed directly above the outlet nozzle in the vessel.The plate is supported by legs keeping it above the nozzle itself. This breaks downany vortex that may tend to form owing to the velocity of the ﬂuid being drawn intothe pump suction.
Investment analysis(See earlier item on economic analysis) Refer also to Chapter 17.IsomerizationThe primary commercial use of the branched isomers of C
4,C5, and C 6parafﬁns
is in the production of clean-burning, high-performance transportation fuels. The
elimination of tetraethyl lead over the last 30 years as a means of improving theA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1217
antiknock properties of gasoline and more-recent regulations restricting motor fuel
composition have led reﬁners to select alternative means of producing high-qualitygasoline, (see also Chapter 2). As a result of benzene concentration restrictions,end-point and oleﬁn content limitations, and potential limitations on total aromat-ics concentration, the choices of high-quality gasoline blending components avail-able in the typical reﬁnery are limited. Isomerate, the gasoline blending componentfrom light parafﬁn isomerization, is an ideal choice. Another equally valuable blend-ing components is alkylate resulting primarily from the acid-catalyzed reaction ofiso-butene with an aliphatic oleﬁn. Both isomerization and alkylation yield highlybranched, high-octane parafﬁnic blending components that by themselves can satisfythe strictest environmental requirements. Often, n-butane isomerization is one of thesources for the iso-butane requirements in alkylation.
The process ﬂow for a typical isomerization plant is give below as Figure 19.I.1.The naphtha feed is pre-heated by the reactor efﬂuent before entering the isomerization
reactor. The feed mixed with the hydrogen stream ﬂows down the reactor through thecatalyst bed. The isomerization reaction takes place in the catalyst bed and the reactorefﬂuent leaves the bottom of the reactor to be cooled ﬁrst by heat exchange withthe incoming feed and then by water or air cooling. The cooled efﬂuent enters themiddle of the separator vessel and is ﬂashed with a hydrogen rich gas stream leavingthe top and a liquid phase leaving the bottom of the separator. This liquid streamis routed to a reboiled stripper column where a debutanized isomerate liquid leavesas the bottom product. The butanes and lighter components that leave the top of thetower are partially condensed to provide reﬂux to the tower and a liquid product richin butanes and propane. The uncondensed overhead leaves the stripper condenserdrum to be routed to fuel gas or other processes. Details of the isomerization process

Jet fuels
Product speciﬁcations are a mechanism by which producers and users of a product
identify and control the properties necessary for satisfactory and reliable perfor-mance.
Civilian jet fuelTwo organizations have taken the lead role in setting and maintaining speciﬁcations
for civilian aviation turbine fuel ( jet fuel ): the American Society for Testing and
Materials (ASTM) and the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence (MOD). The spec-iﬁcations issued by these two organizations are very similar but not identical. Manyother countries issue their own national speciﬁcations for jet fuel; these are very nearlyor completely identical to either the ASTM or MOD speciﬁcations. In the Common-wealth of Independent States (CIS) and parts of Eastern Europe, jet fuel is coveredby GOST speciﬁcations.
ASTM D 1655 TheStandard Speciﬁcation for Aviation Turbine Fuels includes spec-
iﬁcations for three commercial jet fuels: two kerosene-type fuels (Jet A and Jet A-1)
and a wide-cut fuel (Jet B). Jet A is used for almost all domestic commercial aviationﬂights in the United States.
Defense Standard 91-91 The United Kingdom Ministry of Defense maintains this
speciﬁcation (formerly titled DERD 2494) for Jet A-1, which is used for most civil
aviation fuels outside the United States and the CIS. There are minor differencesbetween the DEF STAN 91-91 Jet A-1 and ASTM D 1655 Jet A-1 speciﬁcations.
CGSB-3.22 This Canadian General Standards Board speciﬁcation covers wide-cut
fuel (Jet B) used in parts of Canada and Alaska.GOST 10227 This Russian speciﬁcation covers the light kerosene-type fuel, TS-1,
used in the CIS and parts of Eastern Europe, along with T -1, T -2, and RT grades of
fuel.
Joint Checklist A group of oil companies that operate aviation fuel systems in-
ternationally have combined the most restrictive requirements from ASTM D 1655
and DEF STAN 91-91 into a single document: Aviation Fuel Quality RequirementsA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1219"

Checklist.
International Air Transport Association IATA publishes a document entitled Guid-
ance Material for Aviation Turbine Fuels Speciﬁcations. The guidance material con-
tains speciﬁcations for four aviation turbine fuels: three kerosene-type fuels (Jet A, JetA-1, and TS-1) and one wide-cut fuel (Jet B). Jet A meets the ASTM requirements,Jet A-1 meets the Joint Checklist requirements, TS-1 meets the Russian GOST re-quirements, and Jet B meets the Canadian CGSB requirements.
Military jet fuel
The governments of the United States and many other countries maintain separate
speciﬁcations for jet fuel for military use. The reasons for separate speciﬁcationsinclude the operational and logistical differences between the military and civiliansystems and the additional demands that high-performance jet ﬁghter engines placeon the fuel. Presently two fuels are in widespread use by the U.S. military: JP-5 by theNavy, and JP-8 by the Air Force. Both are kerosene-type fuels. The major differencebetween them is the ﬂash point temperature, although there are also minor differencesin other fuel properties. The minimum ﬂash point temperature for JP-8 is 38
◦C, and
for JP-5 is 60◦C. The higher ﬂash point for JP-5 affords an additional degree of safety
in handling fuel on aircraft carriers.
The major difference between U.S. military fuels and commercial fuels is in the use
ofadditives. Otherwise, JP-8 and Jet A-1 are very similar fuels. Table 19.J.1 provides
a comparison between the civilian and military jet fuel speciﬁcation.
Jetties
Tankers and barges are loaded and unloaded at jetties or docks. In almost all circum-
stances these facilities for handling petroleum products are separate from those used1220 CHAPTER 19
for general cargo. Very often tankers, particularly modern ‘ Super’tankers are loaded
and unloaded by submarine pipelines at deep water anchorage. Only the ‘ Onshore’jetty facility is described here. Tanker sizes range from small coastal vessels of 10,000bbl capacity to super tankers in excess of 250,000 bbl capacity. The more commontanker size is one of 140,000 bbl capacity and this size tanker is labeled a T2. Thistanker is usually used for product carrying. It can carry as much as three differentproduct parcels at the same time. The larger tankers are usually used for crude oiltransportation.
Ideally the jetty size should be sufﬁcient to cater for both these size tankers, and
usually at least one of each size at the same time. In some reﬁneries which havejetty facilities these usually include barge loading items also. The barge loading mayhowever be located on remote docking facilities from the larger sea going tankers.A good onshore jetty approach road is mandatory for the operation of the jetty. Thisis required for safety reasons and the easy approach way for emergency vehicles(such as ﬁre engines and ambulances). The approach road is also required foe thetransportation of the operating staff, ship’ s crew and the ships chandler vehicles.Usually this approach road is dedicated for jetty use and will be quite independent ofany adjacent reﬁnery road.
Finally the location of the jetty must allow sufﬁcient waterway room for tankers to
be berthed properly. Tankers arriving from the open sea must have room so that tugscan handle and turn the ship around to face open sea before tying up at the jetty.
A layout plan of a typical tanker jetty is shown in Chapter 13 Figure 13.16. This
chapter also includes a description of ideal jetty conﬁguration, and location relativeto the reﬁnery site. The item also covers the environmental issue when loading andunloading hydrocarbons.
K
Kerosene
Most straight run kerosenes are desulfurized and routed directly to the ﬁnished prod-
uct blending pools. The exception is in the case of the aviation turbine gasoline(ATG) which will require the kerosene precursor to be treated for aromaticsreduction or removal to meet the strict smoke point speciﬁcations associatedwith this ﬁnished product. In present day reﬁneries this is accomplished by hydro-treating the kerosene using a nickel catalyst. In older reﬁneries the aromatics containedin the cut were removed as an extract in a process using SO
2as a solvent. Some detailsA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1221

Kinematic viscosity
The Darcey–Weisbach and Colebrook relationships are based on using a Reynolds
number which varies inversely with the kinematic viscosity. This kinematic viscosity is
deﬁned as the Dynamic (or Absolute) viscosity divided by its density, where dynamicor absolute viscosity is force ×(time/length squared) and the unit for this is the
Poise. The unit most frequently used for the kinematic viscosity is the metric unit—the Stoke. Both viscosities are however usually quoted in the hundredth unit. Thus,absolute viscosity would be the centipoise while the kinematic viscosity would becentistokes.
L
Leaded gasolines
Until the restrictions on lead compounds imposed by the ‘ Clean Air’acts of the
1960s, tetra ethyl lead was used extensively as a gasoline additive to improve OctaneNumber.
Tetra ethyl lead is a liquid with a gravity of 1.66 and a formula Pb(C
2H5)4.I ti se x -
tremely toxic. The restriction of ‘ No Lead’ in gasolines promoted further development
of the catalytic reformer process to obtain higher conversion. It also inﬂuenced the useof the alkylation process and the development of isomerization and the oxygenatedcompounds as octane enhancers in gasoline. Coupled with this, motor manufacturers1222 CHAPTER 19
improved their respective auto engine design to operate efﬁciently on lower octane
number fuel. Tetra Ethyl Lead has all but disappeared from the petroleum industry.Details of modern gasoline development are given in Chapter 2 and details of theOctane enhancer processes are given in Chapter 9.
Light end units
The light end units in the reﬁnery produces the light and heavy naphtha cuts, the
butane LPG, and the propane LPG products respectively. The straight run light endunits take as feed the atmospheric overhead distillate, the overhead distillate fromthe catalytic reformer stabilizer, and the overhead distillate from a thermal crackerfractionator (if there is one in the conﬁguration). A typical process ﬂow schematicshowing the sequence of the light ends unit is given as Figure 19.L.1.
The long range naphtha as the distillate from the atmospheric crude distillation over-
head condensate drum is preheated, usually by heat exchange with the debutanizerbottom product before entering the debutanizer tower. Here the butanes and lighter

fractions are removed as the overhead distillate. The bottom product from this tower is
the long-range debutanized naphtha. This cut enters the naphtha splitter tower whereit is fractionated to meet the speciﬁcation of light naphtha as the overhead distillateproduct and heavy naphtha as the bottom product. The light naphtha fraction is routedto the gasoline pool for blending, while the bottom product is the feed to a catalyticreformer.
The overhead distillate from the debutanizer is preheated and enters the de-propanizer
tower. Butane LPG is the bottom product from this tower and after treating to removeany sulfur products is routed to the LPG pool. The overhead distillate from the de-propanizer contains propane and lighter components. This is preheated and entersthe de-ethanizer column. There is no overhead distillate product from this tower. Theoverhead product is simply the components lighter than propane and leaves as a gas tothe reﬁnery’ s fuel gas system. Some of the overhead vapor leaving the tower top ispartialy condensed to produce the tower reﬂux. The bottom product from this toweris propane LPG and is routed to the LPG pool.
All three towers are reboiled and are operated with overhead reﬂux. Full details
of this process is given in Chapter 4. A similar process is utilized for the lightends from the FCCU. This is usually kept separate from the straight run processdescribed above. Wild distillates (i.e., containing the light ends) from the catalyticreformer stabilizer and the thermal cracker are routed to the straight run light endunits.
Linear programming
This is a computerized technique that came into prominence during the late 1960s
and early 1970s. It is used extensively now by most reﬁners to:
rOptimize new process conﬁgurations
rPlan the reﬁnery operation
rSelect crude oil feed slate and product slate"
"The technique uses equations (linear) that represent the properties of the crude feedand the resulting products. These equations also describe the blending characteristicsof the components making up the ﬁnished product slate. Included also are the costparameters such as the price of crude feed, the reﬁnery fence selling price of products,operating cost, and any other relevant cost centers (such as licensing fees, interest onloans, etc.). These equations form a mathematical model and a suitable programmedcomputer is used to solve these equations to meet the objective function subject tothe constraints of the analysis. Some further details describing linear programs isgiven in Appendix E.1224 CHAPTER 19
LPG—liqueﬁed petroleum gas
Reﬁneries produce two types of LPG (liqueﬁed petroleum gas) products, butane LPG
and propane LPG. These two products are recovered in the straight run light endsunits as described above. They are routed to ﬁnished product storage after treating forthe removal of sulfur in the form of mercaptans. Their speciﬁcations are as follows:
Propane LPG

The LPG’ s are utilized widely in industry and domestically as portable fuel source. Thefact that they are liquids under pressure and are stored in moveable cylinder containersgives them prominence in the work place, at home, and in outside recreation areas.Propane LPG is used domestically for outdoor barbecues, in recreational vehicles, forcooking and heating, and on private boats, etc. Butane LPG is used mostly in industryas a portable heat source. LPGs are also used as automotive fuels. In the U.S. propaneis often used in agricultural tractors. Butane LPG is often used in Europe for taxiﬂeets, etc.
Lube oils
Some, not all, reﬁneries produce lubricating oils. These are considered non-energy
products but are essential to modern living just as much as the energy products ofA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1225

petroleum. About 3–10 grades of basic lube oil components are produced and can be
blended to meet the many grades of light lube oils, engine lubes and heavy turbinelube oils. The production of these basic lube products commences with the vacuumdistillation of atmospheric residue. The processes to arrive at the blendable basicstocks follow the block ﬂow diagram shown as Figure 19.L.2.
The atmospheric residue feed is vacuum distilled to provide two distillate side streams
and a heavy bituminous residue. The light distillate side stream is hydro-treatedto saturate any oleﬁns present and, thus, improve the product color. It is then splitin a vacuum distillation tower to produce the very light spindle oil lube and theslightly heavier machine oil lube. The bottom side stream distillate from the vacuumunit is routed to a de-waxing plant and then to a solvent extraction plant for colorimprovement. Both these units may be operating in a blocked operation with a rafﬁnatefrom propane de-asphalting unit. This unit processes the vacuum residue to removethe asphalt leaving the de-asphalted oil, called ‘ bright stock’ to be dewaxed and oleﬁnextracted in the blocked operation through these two plants. The treated ‘ bright stock’is the base stock for the heavy turbine lube oils. Details of the lube oil productionprocesses are given in Chapter 12.
M
Mass spectrometry
Mass spectrometry is concerned with the separation of matter according to atomic
and molecular mass. It is most often used in the analysis of organic compounds ofmolecular mass up to as high as 200,000 Daltons, and until recent years was largely1226 CHAPTER 19
restricted to relatively volatile compounds. Continuous development and improve-
ment of instrumentation and techniques have made mass spectrometry the mostversatile, sensitive and widely used analytical method available today. One of itsmajor uses in the petroleum reﬁning industry is for the production of distillationcurves such as TBP and EFV . This technique does away with the cumbersome distil-lation apparatus previously used for this purpose. It is also by far the more accuratemethod."
"Material balances
Material balances form the basis for plant design, and are essential in reﬁnery opera-
tion to account for gains and/or losses in the reﬁnery’ s daily production. They are alsoessential in process plant audits and trouble shooting. The primary material balancein the design of a reﬁnery is that for the atmospheric and vacuum crude distillationunit. For this balance the TBP distillation curve (usually from the crude assay) issplit into real components up to C
5’so rC 6’ s and then into mid boiling point or mid
volume point pseudo components. The splitting of the crude in this way provides thecomponent breakdown for the product cuts and the volume, mass, and the numberof moles, together for the same information for the whole crude feed. Details on thedevelopment of the material balances are given in Chapter 3–12. The material bal-ance in all cases is complete and correct when the quantities into the process equalsthe total quantities out when expressed in mass (weight) units. V olumes and molsin and out may differ because of chemical reactions and/or thermal and pressureeffects.
Mechanical ﬂow diagrams
This type of ﬂow diagram is sometimes referred to the P&ID or very often the
Engineering Drawing. Details of this type of drawing is given under the item ﬂowsheets.
Metals in crude oil
Metallic organic compounds have a deleterious effect on some products, and are also
usually poisonous to catalysts in some processes. The most common metals met withare:
rSodium
rNickel
rVanadiumA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1227
and sometimes mercury, etc. in the associated gas streams.
Most of these metallic compounds are found in the asphalt portion of the crude oil and
are usually deeply imbedded in the asphaltene molecules. In the production of fueloil the metal content of the fuel makes the product problematic to the steel productioncompanies who use fuel oil in their processes. Secondly, in the upgrading of the‘ bottom of the barrel’ using a catalytic process (such as hydrocracking or ﬂuid catalyticcracking) these metallic compounds deteriorate the catalyst life and performance ofthe processes. Much has been done in the last decade to improve the catalysts towithstand metals. However, in many cases the true solution to the presence of metalsin the crude is to de-asphalt the heavy vacuum residue and route the de-asphaltedoil as the cracker feed. Not all crude oils contain metal impurities in quantities thatcause process problems. The deasphalting process (as propane deasphalting unit) isdescribed in Chapter 11.
Mid boiling point and mid volume point components
These have been deﬁned and described earlier in this Part 2, ‘ Component balances’ ,
and also in Chapter 1.
N
NaphthaThere are usually two straight run naphtha cuts produced from crude. These are:
rLight naphtha (sometimes called light gasoline)
rHeavy naphtha
Both these naphtha cuts form part of the atmospheric crude distillation overhead
distillate product. This product also contains all of the light ends of the crude oil feed.The stream is therefore debutanized with the components butane and lighter beingrouted to the light ends unit for further fractionation.
The naphtha stream that leaves the bottom of the debutanizer is fed to a naphtha
splitter where it is fractionated to produce the two naphtha cuts. The light naphtha asthe splitter’ s overhead distillate product contains most of the crude’ sC
5’ s and much
of the parafﬁn portion of the crude’ sC 6’ s. Heavy naphtha is recovered as the splitter’ s
bottom product. This product will contain the heavier naphthenes and will be a suitablefeed for a catalytic reformer. The light naphtha has a TBP distillation range of C
5
to around 190◦F and is often used as feed to steams crackers for the production of1228 CHAPTER 19
light oleﬁns. The heavy naphtha as the feed to the catalytic reformer consists of a cut
of about 190◦–360◦F . This end point of 360◦F can vary depending on the severity
operation of the catalytic reformer, the volatility speciﬁcation of the ﬁnished gasoline,and the reﬁnery’ s production requirements.
The non energy product reﬁneries
There are two major types of non-energy reﬁneries. They are:
rThe lube oil reﬁnery
rThe petrochemical reﬁnery
These two production units are usually part of a conventional energy reﬁnery, which
makes it convenient for obtaining their respective feedstocks and for using commonfacilities such as loading stations and jetty. The lube oil reﬁnery has been describedin an earlier item. More information on this subject is found in Chapter 12. Thischapter also details the production and properties of the asphalt product of this typeof reﬁning.
The petrochemical reﬁnery
This reﬁnery is concerned with processing products generated by the energy portion
of the reﬁning of crude oil into suitable feed streams to the:
rProduction of aromatics
rProduction of oleﬁnic products"
"Both of these types of petrochemical reﬁneries have been described brieﬂy in Chap-ter 1. Only the production of aromatics is dealt with in detail.
The aromatics referred to here will be the more common with respect to crude oil
reﬁning. These are:
rBenzene
rToluene
rEthyl benzene
rPara-xylene
rMeta-xylene
rOrtho-xylene
The conﬁguration described here begins with a mixed aromatic stream which has beenobtained by catalytic reforming of a high naphthene content naphtha (usually from ahydro-cracking process). The reformate from this high naphthene feed is very rich inA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1229
the aromatics listed above. To increase the aromatic content as feed to the aromatic
complex the aromatics are separated from the remaining parafﬁns by an extractionprocess. The rich aromatic feed is separated into the required products by a seriesof distillations, a crystallization or adsorption process, an aromatic isomerizationprocess, and αdealkylation process. The block ﬂow diagram is shown as Figure 12.18
of Chapter 12.
In this particular conﬁguration the purpose is to maximize benzene, toluene, and
ortho xylene at the expense of ethyl benzene, meta and para-xylenes. To recover para-xylene all that would be required is an adsorption or crystallization unit before theisomerization unit.
O
Octane number
Octane numbers are a measure of a gasoline’ s resistance to knock or detonation in
a cylinder of a gasoline engine. The higher this resistance is the higher will be theefﬁciency of the fuel to produce work. A relationship exists between the antiknockcharacteristic of the gasoline (Octane Number) and the compression ratio of the enginein which it is to be used. The higher the octane rating of the fuel then the higher thecompression ratio of engine in which it can be used. By deﬁnition, an octane number isthat percentage of iso-octane in a blend of iso-octane and normal heptane that exactlymatches the knock behavior of the gasoline. Thus, a 90 octane gasoline matches theknock characteristic of a blend containing 90% iso-octane and 10% n-heptane.
The knock characteristics are determined in the laboratory using a standard single
cylinder test engine equipped with a super sensitive knock meter. The referencefuel (iso octane and C7 blend) is run and compared with a second run using thegasoline sample. Two octane numbers are used: the ﬁrst is the research octane number(RON) and the second is the motor octane number (MON). The same basic equipmentis used for both octane numbers, but the engine speed is increased for the motoroctane number. The actual octane number obtained in a commercial engine would besomewhere between the two numbers. The signiﬁcance of the two octane numbers isto evaluate the sensitivity of the gasoline to the severity of the operating conditionsin the engine. Invariably the research octane number is higher than the motor octanenumber, the difference between them is quoted as the ‘ sensitivity’of the gasoline.
The pump octane posted in the U.S. is (RON +MON)/2. In Europe often only RON
is given.1230 CHAPTER 19
Offsite systems
Among the major units found in most reﬁnery offsite systems are:
rStorage
rProduct blending
rRoad and rail loading
rJetty facilities
rWaste disposal
rEfﬂuent water treating
Storage facilitiesCrude oil feed and processed products are stored in storage tanks of various sizes and
types. These tanks are usually located together in the reﬁnery area suitably deﬁned as‘ the Tank Farm’ . Most reﬁnery storage tanks fall into the following categories:
rAtmospheric storage
rPressure storage
rHeated storage
Details of all these type of tankage are given in Chapter 13.
Atmospheric storage
As the name implies, all atmospheric storage tanks are open to the atmosphere, or aremaintained at atmospheric pressure by a controlled vapor blanket. These tanks fallinto two categories:
rCone roof tanks
rFloating roof tanks
Cone roofed tanks. Used for the storage of non-toxic liquids with fairly low volatility.
In its simplest form the roof of the tank will contain a vent, open to atmosphere,which allows the tank to “ breathe”when emptying and ﬁlling. A hatch in the roofalso provides access for sampling the tank contents. In oil reﬁning this type of tankis used for the storage of gas oils, diesel, light heating oil, and the very light lube oils(e.g., spindle oil).
Floating roofed tanks. Light volatile liquids may also be stored at essentially atmo-
spheric pressure by the use of “ Floating Roof ” tanks. The roof of this type of storage
tank literally ﬂoats on the surface of the liquid contents of the tank. In this way theair space above the liquid is reduced to almost zero, thereby minimizing the amountof liquid vaporization that can occur. The roof is specially designed for this serviceA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1231
and contains a top skin and a bottom skin of steel plate, held together by steel struts."
"These struts also provide strength and rigidity to the roof structure. The roof movesup and down the inside of the tank wall as the liquid level rises when ﬁlling and fallswhen emptying. Liquids stored in this type of tank have relatively high volatilitiesand vapor pressures such as gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, and the like. In oil reﬁningthe break between the use of cone roof tank and ﬂoating roof is based on the “ ﬂashpoint” of the material. Normally this break point is for materials with a ﬂash pointof 120
◦F or below. Floating roof tanks (very large in capacity) are used for storing
the crude oil feed. Diagrams of a cone roof tank and a ﬂoating roof tank are shown(Figure 19.O.1) as Figures 13.5 and 13.6 in Chapter 13.
Pressure storage
Pressure storage tanks are used to prevent or at least minimize the loss of the tankcontents due to vaporization. These types of storage tanks can range in operatingpressures from a few inches of water gauge to 250 psig. There are three major typesof pressure storage. These are:
rLow-pressure tanks— These are dome roofed tanks and operate at a pressures ofbetween 3 ins water gauge and 2.5 psig.
rMedium-pressure tanks— These are hemispheroids that operate at pressures be-tween 2.5 psig and 5.0 psig, and spheriodal tanks that operate at pressures up to 15psig.
rHigh-pressure tanks— These are either horizontal “ bullets” with ellipsoidal or hemi-spherical heads or spherical tanks (spheres). The working pressures for these typesof tanks range from 30 to 250 psig. The maximum allowable is limited by tank sizeand code requirements. For a 1,000 bbl sphere, the maximum pressure is 215 psig,for a 30,000 bbl it is 50 psig. These pressure limits can be increased if the tank isstress relieved.
Although it is possible to store material in tanks with pressures in excess of 250 psig,normally when such storage is required refrigerated storage is usually a better alter-nate.
Heated storage tanks
Heated storage tanks are more common in the petroleum industry than most others.They are used to store material whose ﬂowing properties are such as to restrict ﬂow atnormal ambient temperatures. In the petroleum industry products heavier than dieseloil, such as heavy gas oils, lube oil, and fuel oil are stored in heated tanks. Most oftentanks are heated by immersed heating coils or bayonet type immersed heaters. Steamis normally used as the heating medium. Where immersed heating is used the tankis agitated usually by side located propeller agitators. External circulating heating isused for tanks if the contents are mixed by means of jet mixing. External tank heatingis used when there is a possibility of a hazardous situation occurring if an immersed1232 CHAPTER 19

heater leaks. A calculation procedure for tank heater sizing is included in Chap-
ter 13.
Product blending facilities
Blending is the combining of two or more components to produce a desired end
product. The term in reﬁnery practice usually refers to process streams being combinedto make a saleable product leaving the reﬁnery. Generally these include gasolines andmiddle distillates such as jet fuel, kerosene, diesel, and heating oil. Other blendedﬁnished products will include various grades of fuel oil and lube oil. The blendingof the process streams is accomplished either by batch blending in blending tanks orin-line blending in the pipe line itself.
In-line versus batch blending
In batch blending the components are routed separately into a single receiver tankwhere they are mixed and tested to ensure the mixed product meets the ﬁnishedproduct speciﬁcation. In the case of in-line blending the component streams are routedthrough automatically operated ﬂow valves to a ﬁnished product tank. With moderncomputerized control technology in-line blending is becoming the more commonform of blending process.
The in-line blender operation
An in-line blender is essentially a multiple stream controller with feed-back. Thecontroller itself is a computer into which the recipe for the blend is programmed. Thecontroller automatically starts the pumps for the blend components and motivatesthe ﬂow control valves on the component lines. These control valves are reset bycomputer inert-action to meet the required component quantities for ﬁnished productspeciﬁcation. A series of on line analyzers located in the blend run down lines, monitorthe ﬁnished product properties and, in turn, reset the control valves.
Road and rail loading facilities
The extent of product shipping facilities required in a chemical or petroleum complex"
"depends on the size of the complex, the local market, the number of different productsto be shipped and the market to be supplied. Normally the shipping facilities installedin most plants are sufﬁcient to cater for normal product handling and the ﬂexibilityrequired for seasonal demands. The capacity of these facilities will almost invariablyexceed the plant’ s total production.
The most common method of shipping product is by road or rail in suitably designed
tanker cars. In the case of large complexes located on coastal or river side sites1234 CHAPTER 19
shipping by barge or ships is feasible to carry the bulk of the plant products. Chapter
13 describes the loading of road and rail cars under the following subject headings:
rLoading rates
rLoading equipment
rLoading arrangements
Loading rates are described with details on the calculation procedures to arrive atthese rates example calculations are provided. Drawings of loading equipment andtheir typical arrangements are also provided in this section of Chapter 13.
Jetty and dock facilities
Tankers and barges are loaded and unloaded at jetties or docks. In almost all cir-
cumstances these facilities for handling petroleum products are separate from thoseused for general cargo. Very often tankers, particularly the modern ‘ Super’tanker areloaded and unloaded by submarine pipelines at deep water anchorage. This sectionof Chapter 13 deals only with onshore docking facilities. The following items in thissection of the chapter are:
rJetty size and location
rEquipment
rLoading rates
rBallast handling
rSlop and spill collection facilities
Jetty size and location covers the need to accommodate the various tanker or bargesizes. It continues with the parameters to be considered in the location of the jettyitself. This topic includes consideration of the access to the jetty and the depth of thewater at the location. The jetty must be close to the reﬁnery’ s tank farm and mustcater for sufﬁcient pipe-way. Just as important too is that the jetty has good approachroad and parking facilities. These topics are discussed in some detail.
The equipment used for tanker loading and unloading is described in detail with
supporting diagrams.
In the item on loading (and unloading) rates emphasis is placed on the relatively high
pumping rates experienced for this function. The item covers the rates usually used fornormal tanker size and those for the barge loading facilities. The other items cover thedisposal of the ships’ ballast and the collection of the spills and leaks that occur in theloading/unloading activities. The collection of these spills is achieved by temporarybooms placed around the vessels. Other topics include communication with shorefacilities and the mooring facilities. These topics are supported by diagrams whereapplicable.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1235
Waste disposal and water efﬂuent treatment
All process plants, including oil reﬁneries produce large quantities of toxic and/or
ﬂammable material during periods of plant upset or emergencies. Properly designedFlare and Slop handling systems are therefore essential to the plant operation. Thissection of Chapter 13 describes and discusses typical disposal systems currentlyin use in the oil reﬁning industry where the hydrocarbon is immiscible with water.Where the chemical is miscible in water special separation systems must be used. Theitem covering waste disposal systems is shown in a block ﬂow diagram for a typicalmodern reﬁnery. The system shown consists of three separate collection systemsbeing integrated to a ﬂare and a slops rerun system. A fourth system is included forthe disposal of the oily water drainage with a connection to the ﬂare and a separateconnection for any oil laden skimming. Further description and discussion of thesedisposal systems is given in the following sections covering:
rBlow-down and slop disposal
rFlares
The description and discussion of these systems highlights the equipment used and,where applicable, the sizing parameters for some of these items. All the descriptionsare further illustrated by diagrams.
This section of the offsite systems deals with the treating of waste water accumulated"
"in a chemical process complex before it leaves the complex. Over the years require-ments for safeguarding the environment has demanded close control on the qualityof efﬂuents discharged from chemical and oil reﬁning plants. This includes efﬂuentsthat contain contaminants that can affect the quality of the atmosphere and those thatcan be injurious to plant and other life in river waters and the surrounding seas. Efﬂu-ent management in the oil industry has therefore acquired a position of importanceand responsibility to meet these environmental control demands. This topic is furtherexplored in Chapter 14, under the title of “ Environmental Control and Engineeringin Petroleum Reﬁneries” . The item in Chapter 13 deals with the broad principals andmethodology of treating water efﬂuents from paved area run off, ship ballast water,and efﬂuent from the slop and spillage facilities. The major processing equipmentto handle most efﬂuent treating in the petroleum reﬁnery is the API separator. Adetailed description and design parameters of this equipment is given in Chapter 14.Other efﬂuent treating processes such as ﬂocculation and coagulation are describedin Chapter 13.
Oleﬁns
Although the major families or homologues of hydrocarbons found in all crude oils as
described earlier are parafﬁns, cyclic parafﬁns and aromatics, there is a fourth group.1236 CHAPTER 19
These are the unsaturated or oleﬁn hydrocarbon. They are not naturally present in any
great quantity in most crude oils, but are often produced in signiﬁcant quantities duringthe processing of the crude oil to reﬁned products. This occurs in those processes thatsubject the oil to high temperature for a relatively long period of time. Under theseconditions the saturated hydrocarbon molecules break down permanently losing one ormore of the four atoms attached to the quadravalent carbon. The resulting hydrocarbonmolecule is unstable and readily combines with itself (forming double bond links)or with similar molecules to form polymers. An example of such an unsaturatedcompound is as follows:
HH
||
H
C CH Ethylene.
Note the double bond in this compound linking the two carbon atoms.
Overﬂash
Overﬂash is a term normally associated with the design of crude atmospheric or
vacuum towers. Its objective is to provide additional heat (over and above that set by theproduct vaporization required) required by the process to generate the internal reﬂuxrequired by the process. It also inﬂuences the ﬂash zone conditions of temperatureand partial pressure of the hydrocarbon vapor feed. Usually it is ﬁxed at between3 and 5 vol% on crude. This atmospheric ﬂash temperature is now adjusted to thetemperature at the previously calculated partial pressure existing in the ﬂash zone. Afurther description and the purpose of overﬂash is given in Chapter 3.
P
Packed towers
Although the use of trays is generally the ﬁrst choice for fractionation and absorption
tower applications, there are two major instances where packed towers are preferable.These are:
rSmall diameter towers (below 3 ft diameter)
rAt the other end of the spectrum packing in the form of grids and large stackedpacked beds have superceded trays in vacuum distillation towers whose diameterrange up to 30 ft in some cases. This is because packing offers a much lower pressuredrop than traysA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1237
The packing in the tower itself may be stacked in beds on a random basis or in a
deﬁned structured basis. For towers up to 10–15 ft the packing is usually dumped orrandomly packed. Above this tower size and depending on its application the packingmay be installed on a deﬁned stacked or structured manner. For practical reasons andto avoid crushing the packing at the bottom of the bed the packing is installed in beds.As a rule of thumb packed beds should be around 15 ft in height. About 20 ft shouldbe a maximum for most packed sections.
Properties of good packing are as follows:
rShould have high surface area per unit volume
rThe shape of the packing should be such as to give a high percentage of area in
active contact with the liquid and the gas or in the two liquid phases in the case ofextractors
rThe packing should have favorable liquid distribution qualities
rShould have low weight but high unit strength
rShould have low pressure drop, but high coefﬁcients of mass transfer
Some data on the various common packings together with a typical packed towerlayout are given in Chapter 18. This chapter also gives design procedures and data forpacked towers in general. These procedures and characteristics of the packed towerare supported by diagrams and graphical correlations where applicable.
Petrochemical reﬁneries
(See the previous item on ‘ Non-Energy Product Reﬁneries’ ).
Planning reﬁnery operations
The basic organization of an oil company consists essentially of three main depart-
ments:
1.0 The marine department
2.0 The reﬁning department3.0 The marketing department"
"The functions of these three main departments are co-ordinated by a supply depart-
ment. This department undertakes this role in accordance with the following sequence:
1.0 Marketing department informs the supply department with the quantities of prod-
ucts they can sell.
2.0 Supply department, after making adjustments for stock levels, advises the reﬁnery
of the quantity of each product required.1238 CHAPTER 19
3.0 The reﬁning department advises the supply department of the actual quantities
they can produce and how much crude they will require to do so.
3.0 The supply department arranges with the marine department for the necessary
shipping to:
rProvide the crude
rLift the products
rImport the quantities that cannot be produced
Each reﬁnery organization contains a planning department whose function isto put together the Monthly Running Plan. The main uses of the running planare to provide data for:
rKeeping the supply department and the company executives informed
rProvide information for long term chartering of ships
rArrangement of import programs
rPinpoint future product quality and equipment difﬁculties
The plans reﬂect inventory surplus or deﬁcit in immediate stocks and those due in theshort term and over a period of around 18 months to satisfy the objectives of the supplydepartment. It is also the basis of the reﬁnery’ s running program in the short term. Bythat is meant the establishment of the reﬁnery’ s process plant conditions and productblending programs, storage schedule, etc., on a day by day basis. The program whenextended to each quarter of the 18 months’duration, alerts the supply department ofpossible shortfalls, crude slate requirements, and the reﬁnery’ s possible processingconstraints. These constraints take into consideration scheduled shut downs, storagecapabilities and the like. Full details of a reﬁnery plan together with examples of itsdevelopment are given in Chapter 17.
Plant commissioning
The sequence of events that ends with a plant or plants being fully operational follows
the same lines whether it refers to a single unit or a complex of many units such as areﬁnery.
The commissioning activities fall into the following sequence of events:
rPre-energizing activities
rEnergizing the plant
rConditioning equipment, calibrating instruments, and setting relief valves
rFinal check out, and closing up all vessels
rPreparation for “ start up”
rStart up
rLining out
rPerformance test runs and guarantee test runA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1239
Pre-energizing activities
These are the activities when the contractor or the reﬁnery’ s own staff hands the
plant over to the commissioning operators. At this stage the plant is not connectedto power, steam, water, drains, etc and contains no hazardous material. The commis-sioning team’ s objective now is to check the hardware against speciﬁcations and theengineering drawings. This activity has been given the title ‘ Punch Listing’ . Althoughthe contractor has ﬂushed the plant out before handover a further and more thoroughﬂushout is usually done at this “ safe plant” stage when utility lines and undergroundlines can also be ﬂushed out.
Energizing the plant
When ‘ punch listing’ is complete to everyone’ s satisfaction the plant can be energized.
This includes the connection to power and the other utilities. The commissioning ofthe fuel systems indicates that the plant is now a ‘ Hazardous Area’ and all regulationspertaining to this type of area come into effect.
Conditioning equipment
Reactors, certain pipelines carrying corrosive material, and other items such as the
ﬂare, and heater boxes which are refractory lined require some conditioning beforebeing put into use. These conditioning procedures are usually detailed by the manu-facturers. As most of these procedures call for an energized plant they are carried outby the commissioning team.
Final check out, and closing up of all vessels
This will be the last opportunity to check such items as the internals of towers, frac-
tionation trays, condition of refractory and other linings, hold up grids, distributors,and the bottom of the tower bafﬂing system (to and from the reboiler). A ﬁnal check-out of the piping layout also needs to be carried out at this point. When satisﬁed thatall is satisfactory the commissioning supervisor will authorize the following ﬁnalpre-startup activities to be completed:
rCatalyst loading (where applicable)
rLoading the tower packing where applicable
rClosing up all vessels using the permanent gaskets
In cases where equipment has been subject to a caustic wash the temporary sil-ica level gauges used during the wash are replaced by the speciﬁed operationalones.1240 CHAPTER 19
With the completion of these ﬁnal checks and vessel close up, the plant is now ready
for start up.
Start up and lining outThe activities and their sequence for starting up the plant are carried out as described"
"in the operating manual. In the case of an oil reﬁning plant for example the ﬁrst activityis to eliminate air from the plant systems. This is done by using water or steam orinert gas or a combination of all three.
After the purging comes the introduction of the cold feeds. In the case of units that
contain reactors and use hydrogen under pressure a leak testing program is required.Where water has been used for purging, the water is replaced by the oil feed. Thisis termed the ‘ oil squeeze’ . Start up may be deﬁned as beginning when the purgeprogram shows conditions to be safe to apply heat into the plant.
Pour points
The ‘ Pour Point’of an oil is the temperature at which the oil ceases to ﬂow. It is
usually a test applied to middle distillates, lube oils, and fuel oils. The test itself isquite simple and requires the sample oil to be carefully treated before the test and toreduce its temperature in a controlled and orderly way. Unlike most other petroleumproperties pour points of two or more components cannot be blended directly to givea pour point of the blended stock. Blending indices are used with the volumetriccomposition of the blend components for this purpose. Details of the blending for‘ Pour Point’are given in Chapter 1 while details of the test itself are given in Chap-ter 16.
Predicting product properties
Product properties are predicted from a composition of real components and of
pseudo components that make up the product streams. Most crude oil assays willinclude the composition of the light ends in terms of volume or weight percent oncrude. The light ends usually include C1 to C5’ s inclusive. The remainder of thecrude oil may be divided into pseudo components based on the TBP curve. Detailsof this are given in Chapter 1 and further illustrated in Sections of Chapter 2 andChapter 3.
The pseudo components are either expressed as wt% or vol% on whole crude, and are
identiﬁed as either mid boiling point or mid volume on crude. This concept is furtherA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1241
deﬁned again in Chapter 1, Chapter 2, and Chapter 3 and under the title of Mid Boiling
Points in this chapter. From the assay data and curves, properties such as speciﬁcgravity, sulfur content, pour points, etc. are given to these pseudo components eitherin terms of boiling point or their mid volume point on crude. In most cases the propertyof a cut is determined by the sum of these component properties times their vol% orwt% in the cut. In a few cases however the direct multiple of properties and percentagesis not acceptable to deﬁne the overall property of the cut. The most notable are ﬂashpoints of blended cuts, and pour points. Here blending indices are used as the multipleof volume composition. These indices are given in Chapter 1. The sulfur content of aproduct is always quoted as a percent by weight of the product. In this case thereforeboth the pseudo components and the sulfur content (from assay) are converted toweight.
The ﬂash point of a product is related to its ASTM distillation by the expression:
Flash Point =0.77 (ASTM 5% in
◦F–150◦F)
To determine the viscosity of a blend of two or more components, a blending index
must be used. A graph of these indices is given in Maxwell’ s“Data Book on Hydro-
carbons” , and part of this graph is reproduced as Figure 1.08 in Chapter 1. Using theblending indices and having divided the TBP curve into components as before, theviscosity of the fraction can be predicted as shown in the following example:
Viscosity Cs Blending Viscosity
Component V ol% Mid BPt◦F 100◦F index factor
(A) (B) (A ×B)
1 13.0 410 1.49 63.5 825.5
2 16.5 460 2.0 58.0 957
3 21.0 489 2.4 55.0 1,155
4 18.0 520 2.9 52.5 945
5 18.5 550 3.7 49.0 906.5
6 13.0 592 4.8 46.0 598
Total 100.0 5,387.0
Overall Viscosity index =5,387
100=53.87
From Figure 1.08 (in Chapter 1) an index of 53.87 =2.65 Cs.
(Actual plant test data was 2.7 Cs).
The prediction of molecular weights of product streams are more often required forthe design of the processes which are going to produce those products. There areother more rigorous calculations that can and are used for deﬁnitive design and in1242 CHAPTER 19
building up computer simulation packages. The method presented here is a simple
method by which the mole weight of a product stream can be determined from alaboratory ASTM distillation test. The result is sufﬁciently accurate for use in re-ﬁnery conﬁguration studies and the like. A relationship exists between the meanaverage boiling point of a product (commonly designated as MEABP), the API grav-ity, and the molecular weight of petroleum fractions. This is described in detail inChapter 1.
Preheat exchanger train
In most distillation processes heat recovery by heat exchange is of great importance. In"
"the design of major processes such as the crude oil distillation unit, cracker recoveryunits and the like the optimization of this heat recovery concept is of paramountimportance. The method best adopted to undertake this heat recovery concept isdescribed in detail in Chapter 3. Brieﬂy the method consists of examining severalconﬁgurations of a heat transfer train, applying “ pinch”analysis a cost data to theequipment, and to determine the terminal feed temperature of each conﬁguration. Thisend temperature relates to the heater duty required and therefore to the fuel requiredby the heater. An economic balance may then be made to select the optimum heatexchanger conﬁguration. Developing the various conﬁgurations is made by using thetotal enthalpy of the feed (in this case the crude oil feed to the atmospheric distillationunit) and the total enthalpies of the exchanged streams. This is shown by Figure 3.14of Chapter 3, and is reproduced on page 1250.
Process guarantees
Among the items of major concern to the operating reﬁnery staff and the engineering
contractor in the design, procurement, and construction of a grass roots process orindeed a revamped process, is the ﬁnal process guarantees that are developed andaccepted. The process guarantees may begin to be developed as soon as a ﬁrm processhas been established and manufacturers’guarantees obtained for the performance ofthe various manufactured items of equipment.
The process performance is tied also to a guarantee of its efﬁciency. This will be
in terms of a guarantee of the utility consumption in the plant whilst operating onthe design throughput and conditions. These guarantees as written will differ fromprocess to process but will usually follow a pattern or format.

rDescription of the notices to be given in the event the guarantees are not met
These items are described and discussed in Chapter 17 and an example of both theperformance guarantee and its associated utility guarantee is given in Appendix 17.9of this Chapter.
Process conﬁgurations
Process conﬁgurations are represented in the form of block ﬂow diagrams. They are
prepared usually as the ﬁrst step in deciding the type of process units that will make upa desired complex. These units are shown in sequence to each other by blocks whichwill be labeled with their throughput size (in the case of a petroleum reﬁnery in barrelsper stream day or in cubic meters per stream day). The diagram is further developedshowing the product and feed lines from and to the unit blocks. The measure of ﬂowis shown on each line. This will be in terms of barrels per calendar day or cubicmeters per calendar day. Several block ﬂow diagrams of differing conﬁgurations butmeeting the end product objectives will be developed prior to the decision as to whichroute meets all the company’ s objectives. A simpliﬁed block ﬂow diagram is shownas Figure 19.P .1.
Each of these process conﬁgurations will be cost estimated to provide a comparative
capital or installed cost, their operating costs, and the reﬁnery price for products

conﬁguration can be made using the company’ s accepted evaluation procedures orby linear programming using a computer. Details of the development of a processconﬁguration is given in Chapter 2. The use of process conﬁguration in economicevaluation is described and discussed in Chapter 17. The sequence of events usingprocess conﬁgurations that leads to a decision making item is given in Chapter 17 asFigure 17.3.
Project duty speciﬁcation
Among the ﬁrst activities to initiate a reﬁnery project is the development of the
“ Project Duty Speciﬁcation” . This document must describe in detail the plant orcomplex of plants the company wishes to build. Among the major items of the ProjectSpeciﬁcation are:
The process speciﬁcation
General design criteriaAny preliminary ﬂow sheets (duly labeled “ Preliminary” )Utilities speciﬁcationBasis for economic evaluationsMaterials of constructionEquipment standards and codesInstrument standards required
These items are described in detail in Chapter 17.
When completed and approved, the duty speciﬁcation will form part of the enquiry"
"document soliciting competitive bids from suitable contracting companies. More im-portantly it will form part of the contract awarded to the successful contractor. It willbe accompanied in both the enquiry document and the contract with a detail of thecontractor’ s scope of work, type of contract (i.e., Cost Plus, Lump Sum, etc.), guar-antees required and other contractual items, including progress reports and meetings,approval requirements, etc.
Product blending
Finished products are blended with two or more components which are run down
stream products from the reﬁnery processes. The blending in most modern reﬁneriesis done “ In Line” . That is to say that measured amount of each component are mixed
together in the line that ﬁnally enters the respective ﬁnished product storage tanks.The ﬂow of each of the components is controlled ‘ on line’by analyzers which areprogrammed to open or close the component ﬂow control valves to meet the speciﬁed1246 CHAPTER 19
product blend recipes. Although these analyzers are quite accurate the ﬁnal contents
of the ﬁnished tanks are always checked by laboratory tests before dispatch out ofthe reﬁnery. Sufﬁcient room is left in the ﬁnished tank to allow correction if thisbecomes necessary. Gasolines are always checked for octane number, Reid vaporpressure and volatility. Kerosenes are checked for ﬂash point, and volatility. Aviationgasolines are subjected to much more stringent properties which would include watercontent, vapor pressure, and sulfur content. Gas oils (including diesel) are checkedfor diesel index, sulfur content, pour point, viscosity, and ﬂash point. Fuel oils aretested for viscosity, sulfur content, ﬂash point, and pour points. All ﬁnished productsare tested for speciﬁc gravity. Chapter 2 describes and discusses the product proper-ties. This chapter also illustrates the blending recipes in a typical process conﬁgura-tion.
Pseudo components
This subject has been described earlier under the item predicting product properties.
Pumparound
This is the term given to any reﬂux stream which is created inside the distillation
tower by taking off a hot liquid stream, cooling it, and returning the stream back intothe tower two or three trays above the draw off tray. The following Figure 19.P .2 showsa typical pumparound system.
Pumparound systems are usually associated with complex distillation processes such
as the atmospheric and vacuum crude oil distillation, where a single reﬂux stream(i.e., overhead condensate) would result in too low a reﬂux in the lower section of thetower. A single overhead reﬂux also would require a large tower diameter to cater for
Distillation Tower

the increased tower vapor and liquid trafﬁc. The pumparound concept does smooth out
the liquid/vapor trafﬁc in the whole tower. The highest try loading in any distillationtower is below the bottom reﬂux stream. The addition of a pumparound thereforebecomes a prime choice for a study to increase the distillation tower capacity on arevamp project.
Pumps
Types of pumpsPumps in the petroleum and other process industries are divided into two general
classiﬁcations which are
rVariable head-capacity
rPositive displacement
The variable head capacity types include centrifugal and turbine pumps whilst thepositive displacement types cover reciprocating and rotary pumps. A summary ofthese types is as follows:
Centrifugal pumps. Centrifugal pumps comprise of a very wide class of pumps in
which pumping of liquids or generation of pressure is effected by a rotary motion of
one or several impellers. There are no valves in centrifugal type pumps (except ofcourse, isolation valves). Flow is uniform and devoid of pulsation.
Turbine pumps. Turbine pumps are a type of centrifugal pumps designed to recover
power in systems of high ﬂow and high differential pressure. These pumps transmit
some of the kinetic energy in the ﬂuid into brake horsepower. The actual energyrecovery is about 50% of the hydraulic horsepower available. This type of pump isexpensive and is therefore not as widely used as the centrifugal pump.
Rotary pumps. Rotary pumps are positive displacement pumps. Unlike the centrifugal
type pump these types do not throw the pumping ﬂuid against the casing but push
the ﬂuid forward in a positive manner similar to the action of a piston. These pumpshowever do produce a fairly smooth discharge ﬂow unlike that associated with areciprocating pump. The types of rotary pumps commonly used in a process plantare:
Gear pumps
Screw pumpsLobular pumpsVane pumps1248 CHAPTER 19
Reciprocating pumps. These are positive displacement pumps that use a piston within
a ﬁxed cylinder to pump a constant volume of ﬂuid for each stroke of the piston. The"
"discharge from reciprocating pumps is pulsating. Reciprocating pumps fall into twogeneral categories. These are the simplex type and the duplex type. In the case of thesimplex pump there is only one cylinder which draws in the ﬂuid to be pumped on theback stroke and discharges it on the forward stroke. External valves open and closeto enable the pumping action to proceed in the manner described. The duplex pumphas a similar pumping action to the simplex pump. In this case however there are twoparallel cylinders which operate on alternate strokes to one another. That is when theﬁrst cylinder is on the suction stroke the second is on the discharge stroke.
Other positive displacement pumps. There are other positive displacement pumps
commonly used in the process industry for special services. Some of these are:
Metering or proportioning pumps— Which are small reciprocating plunger type
pumps with an adjustable stroke.
Diaphragm pumps— These pumps are used for handling thick pulps, sludge, acid
or alkaline solution, and ﬂuids containing gritty solid suspensions. These are not
usually used in petroleum reﬁning.
Characteristic curves. Pump action and the performance of a pump are deﬁned in
terms of their Characteristic Curves. These curves correlate the capacity of the pump
in unit volume per unit time versus discharge or differential pressures. Typical curvesare shown in Figures 18.13–18.15 of Chapter 18.
Figure 18.13 is a characteristic curve for a reciprocating simplex pump which is direct
driven. Included also is this reciprocating pump on a power drive.Figure 18.14 gives a typical curve for a rotary pump. Here the capacity of the pump
is plotted against discharge pressure for two levels of pump speed. The curves also
show the plot of brake horsepower versus discharge pressure for the two pump speedlevels.
Figure 18.15 is a typical characteristic curve for a centrifugal pump. This curve usually
shows four pump relationships in four plots. These are:
rA plot of capacity versus differential head. The differential head is the difference
in pressure between the suction and discharge.
rThe pump efﬁciency as a percentage versus capacity.
rThe brake horsepower of the pump versus capacity.
rThe net positive suction head (NPSH) required by the pump versus capacity. Therequired NPSH for the pump is a characteristic determined by the manufacturer.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1249
Detailed description and deﬁnition of terms associated with reﬁnery pumps are given
in Chapter 18. The chapter also describes the various pump drivers and supportsthese descriptions and discussions with worked examples. Finally the chapter givesthe contents of a typical process speciﬁcation for a centrifugal pump.
R
Reboilers
Reboilers are one of two heat energy input systems to a fractionation unit. The other
source is the heat delivered by the feed or feeds to the unit. Reboilers are usuallyassociated with the light ends distillation units and the product stabilizers and splitterson catalytic or thermal cracking units. In most cases, the reboiler is of a shell and tubetype or a kettle type. In certain cases a ﬁred heater may be used as a reboiler. This unitis fed either by the liquid phase from the bottom tray of the tower, or by vaporizinga portion of the bottom product. The ﬁrst method uses thermosyphon as the drivingforce for ﬂow through the heat exchanger. In the second case, the reboiler feed maybe pumped or ﬂow into the kettle section of the exchanger. In both cases, the ﬂowfrom the reboiler is returned to the tower below the bottom fractionating tray. Thesetwo types are shown in Figure 19.R.1.

Figure 19.R.2. A kettle type reboiler.
There are two other types of reboilers used in the petroleum industry. These are the re-
circulating thermosyphon and the ﬁred heater reboiler. Details of all types of reboilersare given in Chapter 18.
This chapter also discusses the operation of the reboilers with respect to their pro-
duction of vapor and liquid ﬂow objectives, which are:
1. To provide sufﬁcient vaporising in the tower to strip the bottom product effectively.
2. To establish the loading on the bottom tray (and section) of the tower.3. To establish the driving force for ﬂow through the exchanger in the case of ther-
mosyphon reboilers.
A typical bottom of the tower calculation is provided as an example. The heatingmedium for the heat exchange reboilers may be a hot process stream, or steam at anappropriate temperature and pressure level.
Reciprocating compressors
Reciprocating compressors are widely used in the petroleum and chemical industries."
"They consist of pistons moving in cylinders with inlet and exhaust valves. They arecheaper and more efﬁcient than any other type in the ﬁelds in which they are used.Their main advantages are that they are insensitive to gas characteristics and theycan handle intermittent loads efﬁciently. They are made in small capacities and areused in applications where the rates are too small for a centrifugal. Reciprocatingcompressors are used almost exclusively in services where the discharge pressuresA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1251
are above 5,000 PSIG. However, when compared with centrifugal compressors, the
reciprocating compressors require frequent shutdowns for maintenance of valves andother wearing parts. For critical services, this requires either a spare compressor or amultiple compressor installation to maintain plant throughput. Chapter 18 describesand discusses reciprocating compressors in detail. The chapter includes discussionon the compressors ancillary equipment such as inter stage coolers, valve lifters, andcompressor control in general. Table 18.22 in this chapter lists the services for whichthe various types of compressors are used. It also provides calculation procedures withexample calculation for determining the compressor characteristics such as horse-power, suction, and discharge conditions, etc. Finally the chapter provides the inputrequired in a typical process speciﬁcation for a reciprocating compressor.
Reﬁneries
Most of this work is devoted to the energy reﬁnery. That is the reﬁnery that con-
verts the crude oil feed to energy products such as gasoline, diesel, aviation turbinegasoline, fuel oil, and the like. There are two major reﬁnery complexes however thatconvert the crude oil into non-energy products. These are the lube oil reﬁnery and thepetrochemical reﬁnery. Very often these complexes are located adjacent to the energyreﬁnery and they are often integrated into one major reﬁnery complex. Chapter 12describe and discuss these two reﬁnery complexes. They are also summarized in theintroduction in Chapter 1.
The lube oil reﬁneryThe process conﬁguration for a typical lube oil reﬁnery is given in Chapter 1 as Figure
1.13. Brieﬂy, the light vacuum distillate from the crude vacuum distillation unit isrouted to a secondary vacuum distillation unit where a light and heavy spindle oilcuts are removed as distillate and light motor grade oil as residue. Both the motoroil and heavy spindle oil are hydrotreated in blocked operation. The light and hydrotreated heavy spindle oils, with a portion of the motor oil enter the spindle oil pool.The remainder of the motor oil is routed to the light engine lube pool. The mediumvacuum gas oil distillate from the crude oil vacuum distillation unit is routed directlyto a de-waxing unit (in this case a methyl ethyl ketone process). A portion of thede-waxed product is routed to the light engine oil pool while the remainder entersthe heavy engine oil pool. The heavy vacuum gas oil cut from the vacuum unit istreated in the fufural extraction unit for the removal of the heavy oleﬁn componentsbefore entering the de-waxing plant operating on a blocked operation. The de-waxedproduct from this operation is divided between the heavy engine oil pool and theturbine lube oil pool. The residue from the crude oil vacuum unit is de-asphaltedin a propane de-asphalting unit. (Note: There are other de-asphalting processes butpropane de-asphalting is the most common). The de-asphalted oil from this unit is1252 CHAPTER 19
called ‘ Bright Stock’and its processing follows that of the heavy vacuum gas oil,
again on a blocked operation. After fufural extraction and dewaxing the bright stockis routed to the turbine lube oil pool.
Finally a portion of the vacuum residue is routed directly to the bitumen blending pool
bypassing the PDA (propane de-asphalting) unit. A portion of the extracted asphaltstream from the PDA unit is routed to a bitumen blowing unit while the remainderjoins the vacuum residue in the bitumen blending pool. The blown bitumen is thethird stream that enters the bitumen blending pool. The various blended grades ofbitumen are routed to storage and packaging. The base stocks of the turbine, engineoils, and spindle oils are sent to blending and packaging for further preparation of therespective commercial products ready for dispatch.
The petrochemical reﬁneryA conﬁguration for a typical petrochemical reﬁnery is given in Chapter 1 and shown"
"as Figure 1.14 in that chapter. This conﬁguration conﬁnes itself to the productionof the oleﬁn feedstock following steam cracking of a feedstock consisting of lightatmospheric crude oil distillate, a naphtha cut, and the light distillate from a hydro-cracker. The reﬁneries aromatic product stream is produced in a conventional catalyticreformer operating with a blend of straight run naphtha and hydro-cracker naphthaas feedstock. This reformate product enters an aromatic extraction unit where anaromatic rich stream leaves as the product. This conﬁguration shows a coking unittaking the vacuum crude distillation residue as feed. The main purpose of this unit inthe conﬁguration is to provide increased feed to the hydrocracker and thus additionalnaphtha to the reformer and steam cracker. Other residue conversion units may beconsidered as an alternate to the coking unit, such as ‘ Deep Fluid Cracking’unit, ora residue hydrocracking unit.
Reformulated gasolines
The requirements of the clean air act of 1990 and additions to it since have changed
reﬁning requirements to meet this product’ s need quite signiﬁcantly. Prior to this datemuch of the gasoline ﬁnished product recipe consisted of normal light naphtha, areformate, usually some cracked naphtha and possibly an alkylate, with some butaneadded to meet volatility. The clean air requirement and its subsequent additions forceda reduction of both the reformate and the cracked stock and to replace them withoxygenates such as MTBE and TAME to meet octane number. Oxygenates were usedoriginally simply as a additive to improve octane number. However, because of theiroxygen content their addition was also required to reduce the carbon monoxide andhydrocarbons in the emission gases. There are a number of oxygenates used in gasolinemanufactures; some of the more common are given in the following Table 19.R.1.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1253

The EPA established limits for the use of each oxygenates in gasoline blends. For
example, MTBE could be blended up to 15 vol% subject to an overall limit of 2.7wt% oxygen content. The role of MTBE and other oxygenates was reviewed in the late1990s after it was discovered that underground storage tanks had not been upgradedto retain reformulated gasoline. As a consequence tanks were leaking gasoline thatcontained MTBE into the ground and drinking water systems. Therefore, use ofMTBE in the U.S. was essentially discontinued by the end of 2002. MTBE is stillwidely used outside the U.S. although the trend in western Europe is to use ETBEinstead. More details on the manufacture of gasolines are given in Chapter 2.
Reid vapor pressure
This test is the standard test for low boiling point distillates. It is used for naphtha,
gasoline, light cracked distillates, and aviation gasoline. For the heavier distillates withvapor pressures expected to be below 26 psig at 100
◦F the apparatus and procedures
are different. Only the Reid vapor pressure for those distillates with vapor pressuresabove 26 psig at 100
◦F are described in Chapter 16. The apparatus used for this test
is given as Figure 16.5.
Relief valves
Full details and discussion on relief systems which include the relief valves used in
the petroleum industry are given in Chapter 13. The following is a list of those typesof relief valves commonly used in industry. These have been approved according toASME V111 “ Boiler and Pressure Vessel” code:
Conventional safety relief valves
In a conventional safety relief valve the inlet pressure to the valve is directly opposed
by a spring closing the valve, the back pressure on the outlet of the valve changes the1254 CHAPTER 19
inlet pressure at which the valve will open. A diagram of a conventional relief valve
is shown in Chapter 13 as Figure 13.37.
Balanced safety relief valves
Balanced safety valves are those in which the back pressure has very little or no
inﬂuence on the set pressure. The most widely used means of balancing a safety reliefvalve is through the use of a bellows. In the balanced bellows valve, the effective areaof the bellows is the same as the nozzle seat area and back pressure is prevented fromacting on the top side of the disk. Thus the valve opens at the same inlet pressureeven though the back pressure may vary. A diagram of a balanced safety relief valveis shown in Chapter 13 as Figure 13.38.
Pilot operated safety relief valves
A pilot-operated safety relief valve is a device consisting of two principal parts, a"
"main valve and a pilot. Inlet pressure is directed to the top of the main valve piston,and with more area exposed to pressure on the top of the piston than on the bottom;pressure, not a spring, holds the main valve closed. At the set pressure the pilot opensreducing the pressure on top of the piston and the main valve goes fully open.
Resilient seated safety relief valves
When metal-to-metal seated conventional or bellows type safety relief valves are
used where the operating pressure is close to the set pressure, some leakage can beexpected through the seats of the valve (Refer to API Standard 527, “ CommercialSeat Tightness of Safety Relief Valves with Metal-to-Metal Seats” ).
Rupture disk
A rupture disk consists of a thin metal diaphragm held between ﬂanges. The disk
is designed to rupture and relieve pressure within tolerances established by ASMECode.
Residue conversion units
The conversion of residues to more commercially attractive products is described and
discussed in Chapter 11. The processes addressed in this context are:
Thermal cracking
‘ Deep oil’ﬂuid catalytic crackingResiduum hydro cracking and desulfurizationA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1255
Thermal cracking
The thermal cracking processes refer to those that convert the residuum feed (whether
atmospheric or vacuum residues) into higher grade products such as naphtha andmiddle distillates, by heat at high temperature alone. That is, no catalyst or chemicalsare used in the conversion. The processes themselves are:
Visbreaking
Thermal crackerCokers
Certain confusion exists in the deﬁnition of visbreaking and thermal cracking. Dif-
ferentiation is based on the type of feedstock, severity of cracking or the ﬁnal result.Strictly speaking, the term visbreaking should refer only to the viscosity reduction ofheavy stock as the process main objective.
A residue feed stream (either from the atmospheric tower or the crude vacuum tower),
is cracked in a specially designed heater. The efﬂuent from the heater is quenched androuted to a fractionator, sometimes with a pre-ﬂash. The products of cracking suchas light gases, naphtha, gas oil, and residue are separated in the conventional manner.Some 20% of the residue feed can be converted into lighter products, mostly gas oil,by this process. Figure 11.1 of Chapter 11 shows a typical one stage thermal cracker.A visbreaker unit would have the same process conﬁguration but the temperatureseverity and residence time in the heater would be less stringent than that required forproduct up grading.
There are two coker processes: the delayed coker, and the ﬂuid coker. In the delayed
coker the residuum feed is heated to above its dissociation temperature in a ﬁredheater. Some coke is formed in the heater but the major portion of the coke is formedin the large drum to which the heater efﬂuent is routed. The hot efﬂuent is retained inthis drum for a speciﬁed period of time (in some cases 8–12 hr). The liquid phase isdrawn off slowly leaving the coke to remain in the drum. At the end of the speciﬁedperiod or when the drum is full, the coke is cooled and removed using high-pressurewater jets.
Most present day ﬂuid-coking units use a proprietary process licensed by Exxon
called Flexi-Coking. Brieﬂy, this process is an extension of the traditional ﬂuid-coking process. The extension allows for the gasiﬁcation of the major portion of thecoke make to produce a low Btu gas.
Heavy residuum feed is introduced into the reactor vessel where it is thermally cracked.
The heat for cracking is supplied by a ﬂuidized bed of hot coke transferred to thereactor from the heater vessel. The vapor products of the reaction leave the reactorzone to enter the product recovery section consisting of a scrubber and a conventional1256 CHAPTER 19
fractionating facility. Steam is introduced to the bottom of the reactor to maintain a
ﬂuid bed of coke and to strip the excess coke leaving the reactor free from entrainedoil.
The coke leaving the reactor enters the heater vessel, where some of the coke is
converted into CO/CO
2in the presence of air. This conversion of the coke provides
the heat for cracking which is subsequently transmitted to the reactor by a hot cokestream. The net coke make leaves the heater and enters the gasiﬁer vessel. Air andsteam are introduced into the gasiﬁer to react with the coke producing a low Btugas consisting predominately of hydrogen, CO, CO
2, and nitrogen. This gas together
with some excess air is transferred to the heater, and leaves this vessel to be suitablycleaned and cooled.
Both the delayed coker and the ﬂexi-coker are described and discussed in Chap-
ter 11 with process conﬁguration drawings shown as Figures 11.4 and 11.5 in thatchapter.
Deep oil cracking
This process is a form of the traditional Fluid Catalytic Cracking Process (FCCU)."
"Originally FCC was restricted in the type of feedstock it could handle and one ofthe major constraints in this respect was the Conradson carbon contents of the feed.Even for the processing of distillate it had to be below 10 ppm. There were otherconstraints such as metal content that made the processing of residuum impossible.However in the late 1980s with a much improved catalyst and minor modiﬁcationto the process conﬁguration it became feasible to process most residues, includingvacuum residue in the so-called “ deep catalytic cracking”unit, or DC Full detailsof this process and discussion are given in Chapters 5 and 11. These chapters alsocontain process diagram of deep oil cracking process.
Residue hydrocracking
The most common hydro-cracking process for residue conversion is the ﬁxed catalyst
bed process. There is also a process that utilizes an ebullated catalyst bed but onlythe ﬁxed bed process is described in Chapter 11. A typical process diagram for acomplex utilizing the hydrocracker coupled with a thermal cracker or visbreaker isshown as Figure 11.15. Bitumen feed from the crude vacuum distillation unit entersthe hydrocracker section of the plant to be preheated by hot ﬂash vapors in shell andtube exchangers and ﬁnally in a ﬁred heater. A recycle and make up hydrogen streamis similarly heated by exchange with hot ﬂash vapors. The hydrogen stream is mixedwith the hot bitumen stream before entering the hydrocracker heater. The feed streamsare preheated to the reactor temperature in the ﬁred heater and enter the top of theA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1257
reactor vessel. The feed streams ﬂow downwards through the catalyst beds contained
in the reactor.
The reactor efﬂuent leaves the reactor to enter a hot ﬂash drum. Here the heavy
bituminous portion of the efﬂuent leaves from the bottom of the drum while thelighter oil and gas phase leaves as a vapor from the top of the drum. This vapor issubsequently cooled by heat exchange with the feed and further cooled and partiallycondensed by an air cooler. This cooled stream then enters a cold separator operatingat a pressure only slightly lower than that of the reactor. A rich hydrogen gas streamis removed from this drum to be amine treated and returned as recycle gas to theprocess. The distillate liquid leaves from the bottom of the separator to join a vaporstream from the hot ﬂash surge drum (thermal cracker feed surge drum). Both thesestreams enter the cold ﬂash drum which operates at a much lower pressure than theupstream equipment. A gas stream is removed from the drum to be routed an absorberunit. The liquid distillate from the drum is routed to the de-butanizer in a light endsrecovery unit and subsequently the product recovery process.
Residues
In petroleum reﬁning the term ‘ Residue’refers to the un-vaporized portion of the
heated crude oil entering either the atmospheric crude oil distillation tower or vac-uum tower that leaves these towers as their bottom product. The stream from theatmospheric column is often referred to as the ‘ long’residue while that from thevacuum unit is often called the ‘ short’residue or bitumen. Both residues are black incolor the atmospheric residue has a speciﬁc gravity usually between 0.93 and 0.96,whist the vacuum residue will be 0.99 and higher.

Safety systemsThe most hazardous occurrence in any oil reﬁnery or really any establishment
that handles hydrocarbons is that of a ﬁre. Because of this, considerable empha-sis in the safety policy of these plants is geared to ﬁre prevention and ﬁre ﬁghting.1258 CHAPTER 19
The ﬁre safety measures are more important perhaps in oil reﬁning than any other"
"related facility because of the relative size of most reﬁneries compared with petro-chemical or chemical facilities. Reﬁnery prevention and protection begins at the earlystages of the reﬁnery design and engineering. Chapter 6 details the development ofthe ﬁre prevention and ﬁre ﬁghting through the early stages of the reﬁnery design indescribing the relevant passages that are usually contained in the project design spec-iﬁcation. There are engineering and design standards that contractors must adhere to.They include the standards for mechanical equipment, electrical equipment (such asthe ‘ Area Classiﬁcation Code’which sets the parameters for equipment in terms ofﬁre prooﬁng (i.e., whether the item is to be spark proof, etc.) that will be located inthe various areas of the reﬁnery. The piping and layout speciﬁcation will detail thepiping codes to be used and the material break points. It will proceed to establishthe criteria for equipment and tankage layout with respect to ﬁre prevention (e.g.,distance of ﬁred heaters from other equipment). Other design speciﬁcations includeamongst other requirements, ﬁre prevention equipment such as sprays to be locatedon storage tanks, and vessels. Finally this Chapter 6 describes the location, size, andoperation of reﬁnery ﬁre mains. On large installations these could amount to three ormore separate ﬁre main loops remotely and centrally controlled and operated.
Other safety systems that are part of petroleum reﬁning concern the handling of
hazardous chemicals. The item in Chapter 6 covers some of these compounds as totheir storage and handling in the reﬁnery. The chemicals selected as the most hazardoususually met with in the reﬁning processes are: AHF (anhydrous hydroﬂuoric acid),amines, furfural, hydrogen sulﬁde, and MEK (methyl ethyl ketone). The compositionof each of these chemicals is described, together with their injurious effect on humansand the remedial procedures to be adopted in the event of an accident. The chaptercontinues with a review of the materials of construction for these chemicals and theprotective clothing that should be worn when handling them. The ﬁre hazards of thesechemicals are also highlighted.
Side stream stripping
Side streams from multi-component distillation towers are stripped free of entrained
lighter products. Stripping may be accomplished either by injection of steam throughthe hot side-stream in a trayed column, or by injection of an inert gas instead ofsteam, or by reboiling the bottom product of the stripper tower. By far the mostcommon method is that of steam stripping and the most common application is onthe atmospheric crude distillation unit. Figure 19.S.1 shows the bottom distillate sidestream stripper of a crude distillation unit.
Each side stream draw off from the main tower would be stripped free of entrained
light ends in similar trayed columns. Normally these side stream columns wouldA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1259

be stacked to provide a single stripping tower. Such an arrangement is shown in
Chapter 3 Figure 3.2. This chapter also describes the side stream stripper functionwith example calculations. It also provides recommended steam rates for the variousstripping functions.
Soaking volume factor
The design of a thermal cracker is keyed to the conﬁguration and temperature pro-
ﬁle across the heater and soaking drum or soaking coil. The degree of cracking isdependant on this temperature proﬁle and the residence time of the oil under theseconditions. The soaking volume factor (SVF) is related to product yields and thedegree of conversion. Deﬁnition of these items are given in Chapter 11. A designcalculation using the SVF (soaking volume factor) is given as Appendix 1 of thischapter.
Speciﬁc gravity
The speciﬁc gravity of a liquid is the weight of a known volume of the liquid at
a known temperature compared with water under the same conditions. The stan-dard weight is taken as one gram and the standard temperature is usually 60
◦Fo r
15◦C. The speciﬁc gravity of a petroleum compound is the basis for development
of the material balance in design work, and most measurements within the reﬁnery.1260 CHAPTER 19
The basic speciﬁc gravities are given as an essential part of the crude assay. They
are usually presented as a curve of speciﬁc gravities (usually quoted as◦API)
against mid point distillation temperatures. API gravities are related to speciﬁc gravi-ties by the equation: speciﬁc gravity =141.5/(131.5 +
◦API). The speciﬁc gravity of
any petroleum compound may be calculated using the method provided in Chapter 1.The speciﬁc gravity of crude oil and its products are obtained in the reﬁnery us-ing the test method described in Chapter 16. The method uses a properly calibratedhydrometer under laboratory conditions.
Splitter, naphtha"
"In all hydro skimming reﬁneries the key process, next to the crude distillation process
is the catalytic reformer. The correct design and subsequent operation of this processproduces the hydrogen stream that is required by many reﬁnery operations. Importantto the efﬁcient operation of this process is the correct boiling point range of thenaphtha feed. This is ensured by the fractionation of the full range naphtha streamfrom the crude unit overhead distillate. This is accomplished as part of the lightends unit complex. Typically the total overhead distillates plus in some cases othernaphtha distillates (from thermal crackers) are ﬁrst de-butanized in the light endsde-butanizer column. The bottom product from this column is the de-butanized fullrange naphtha. This stream is delivered hot to a naphtha splitter fractionator whichproduces a light naphtha overhead and a heavy naphtha the bottom product. Thefractionation between these two products maximizes the naphthene content of theheavy naphtha. As this heavy naphtha is fed to the catalytic reformer the amount ofnaphthenes in its composition will, to large extent, determine the amount of hydrogenthe unit will produce. Splitter towers contain between 25 and 35 actual distillationtrays and operate at overhead reﬂux ratios of between 1.5 and 2.0. Further details anddescription is given in Chapter 4.
Stacks
Stacks are used to create an updraft of air from the ﬁrebox of a heater. The purpose of
this is to cause a small negative pressure in the ﬁrebox and thus enable the introductionof air from the atmosphere. This negative pressure also allows for the removal of theproducts of combustion from the ﬁrebox. The stack therefore must have sufﬁcientheight to achieve these objectives and overcome the frictional pressure drop in theﬁrebox and the stack itself.
The height required for a stack to achieve good draft can be estimated from the
following equation:
D=0.1 8 7H( ρ
a−ρg)A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1261
where
D=draft in ins of water.
H=stack height in feet.
ρa=density of atmospheric air in lbs/cuft.
ρg=density of stack gasses in lbs/cuft at stack conditions.
For stack gas temperature use 100◦F lower than gases leaving the convection section.
Stack gasses are mostly nitrogen with some CO 2with an average molecular weight
of about 28. Details on stacks including velocity head, emissions, and environmental
considerations are given in Chapter 18.
Steam and condensate systems
In most plants, steam condensate accumulated in the various processes is collected
into a single header and returned to the boiler or steam generating plant. It is storedseparate to the treated raw water because condensates may contain some oil con-tamination. A stream of treated water and condensate are taken from the respec-tive storage tanks and pumped to the deaerator drum. The condensate stream passesthrough a simple ﬁlter on route to the deaerator to remove any oil contamination.Low-pressure steam is introduced immediately below the packing in the deaeratorto ﬂow upwards countercurrent to the liquid streams to remove any entrapped airin the liquid. The deaerated boiler feed water (BFW) is pumped by the boiler feedwater pumps into the steam drum of the steam generator. There will normally bethree 60% pumps for this service. Two will be operational and one will be on standby.These pumps are the most important in any chemical plant or a petroleum reﬁnery.If they fail no steam can be generated and the whole complex is in danger of totalshutdown or worse. Therefore, three separate pumps are used to cater for the normalhigh head and high capacity, and a separate pump driver operating on a completelydifferent power source than electrical power or steam (usually a diesel engine) ismandatory for atleast one of the pumps to minimize the danger of complete shutdown.
The steam drum is located above the generator ﬁrebox. The liquid in the drum ﬂows
through the generator coils located in the ﬁrebox by gravity and thermo-syphon. Amixture of steam and water is generated in the coils and ﬂows back to the steam drum.Here, the steam and water are separated with the steam leaving the drum to enter thesuper-heater coil. This coil located in the lower section of the convection side ofthe heater super heats the saturated steam to the high-pressure reﬁnery steam mains.Let down stations may be located at various points in the reﬁnery to create lowerpressure main systems. De-super heaters are used to establish the correct temperaturelevels in these lower pressure mains. Chapter 13 gives details of a steam generation1262 CHAPTER 19
systems and condensate recovery. Figure 13.27 provides a schematic diagram of a
steam generation plant.

Sulfur removal
Naphtha desulfurizationThis uses catalytic (“ cat” ) reformer hydrogen on a once through basis. Heavy naph-"
"tha feed to the cat reformer is fed to the naphtha hydroﬁner from storage. The feedstream and the hydrogen gas stream are pre-heated by exchange with the hot reac-tor efﬂuent stream. The feed then enters the ﬁred heater which brings it up to thereactor temperatures (about 450
◦F) and leaves the heater to enter the reactor which
operates at about 400–450 psig. Sulfur is removed from the hydrocarbon as hydro-gen sulﬁde in this reactor and the reactor efﬂuent is cooled to about 100
◦F by heat
exchange with the feed. The cooled efﬂuent is collected in a ﬂash drum where thelight hydrogen rich gas is ﬂashed off. This gas enters the suction side of the boostercompressor which delivers it to other hydrotreaters. The liquid phase from the drumis pumped to a reboiled stabilizer. The overhead vapor stream from the stabilizeris routed to fuel while the bottom product, cat reformer feed, is pumped to the catreformer.
Gas oil desulfurizationThis process uses a recycled hydrogen stream to desulphurise a gas oil feed. Fig-
ure 19.S.2 shows the gas oil feed entering the unit to be pre-heated with hot efﬂuentstream before entering a ﬁred heater. Where its temperature is increased to the reactortemperature of about 750
◦F . A hydrogen rich stream is introduced at the coil outlet
prior to the mixed streams entering the reactor. The reactor contains a bed of cobaltmolybdenum on alumina catalyst and desulfurization takes place over the catalystwith 70–75% of the total sulfur in the oil being converted to H
2S.
The reactor efﬂuent is cooled by the cold feed stream, water or air. This cooled efﬂuententers a ﬂash drum where the gas phase and liquid phase are separated. The gas phaserich in H
2S and hydrogen enters the recycle compressor. The gas stream then enters
an amine contactor where the H 2S is absorbed into the amine and removed from
the system. Although the diagram shows a purge stream before the amine absorberin most cases the purge is downstream after the amine cleanup. The purged gas isA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1263

replaced by fresh hydrogen-rich make-up, thus maintaining the purity of the recycle
gas.
The liquid phase leaving the ﬂash drum is pre-heated before entering a stream stripping
column where the light ends created in the process are removed as overhead products.The bottom product leaves the tower to be cooled and stored. Details of desulfurizationof naphtha and heavier products are given in Chapter 8.
Other desulfurizing processes
Light naphtha and lighter hydrocarbons have sulfur content predominately in the form
of mercaptans (see Chapter 1 for a deﬁnition of mercaptans.). These sulfur componentsare easily removed by a simple caustic wash or in licensed processes such as UOP’ sMerox process. Some reﬁners however elect to hydrotreat the debutanized full rangenaphtha before splitting the desulfurized product into the light and heavy product.Indeed several hydrotreat the whole of the crude unit overhead distillate, doing awaywith any further processing to eliminate the mercaptans. The problem here is howeverthe loss of some LPG due to the high hydrogen content of the debutanizer overheaddrum components.1264 CHAPTER 19
At the other end of the crude oil product spectrum, in the area of the heavy vacuum gas
oil and residue, desulfurization by hydrotreating requires a high severity operation.The reason for this is that the sulfur molecules in this case are in the form of thiophenes.These are sulfur molecules deeply encapsulated in the heavy hydrocarbon molecules.To expose the sulfur to the hydrogen stream requires some degree of cracking ofthe hydrocarbon molecule. Desulfurization in this case therefore becomes more ofhydrocracking that hydrotreating.
Sulfur content
Sulfur content of a petroleum product or cut is always quoted as a percent by weight
of the sample. The most common laboratory test for sulfur content is ‘ The LampMethod ASTM D 1266’this is described in detail in Chapter 16. Brieﬂy the test is asfollows:
The sample is burned in a closed system using a suitable heat source and an artiﬁcial
atmosphere of 70% carbon dioxide and 30% oxygen to prevent the formation ofnitrogen oxides. The oxides of sulfur are absorbed and oxidized to sulfuric acid bymeans of a hydrogen peroxide solution. This solution is ﬂushed with air to removecarbon dioxide. The sulfur as sulfate in the absorbent is determined by titration withstandard sodium hydroxide. The calculation of the sulfur content from the titration isgiven by the following equation.
Sulfur Content wt% =16.03 M ×(A/10 W)
where
A=milliliters of NaOH titrated
M=Molarity of the NaOH solution.
W=Grams of sample burned.

Tar
Taris an ill-deﬁned general term that describes heavy petroleum fractions that are
solid or semi-solid at room temperature. An alternative term is bitumen although the"
"latter is better used to denote naturally occurring tar deposits, as in tar pits or tar sands.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1265
In addition to being very viscous or nonﬂowing materials (viscosity >10,000 cP),
tars are also characterized by having relatively high densities lower than about 10 API
degrees, which corresponds to a speciﬁc gravity (60/60) greater than 1.0.
Degrees API =141.5
sp. gr. at 60◦F/60◦F−131.5
Depending on their physical properties, tars may be easily confused with asphalts. Themain difference being that tars are usually either naturally occurring or unprocessedheavy fractions recovered as byproducts from other sources (e.g., petroleum residuesor coal processing) while asphalts are typically processed or manufactured materials,whether air-blown or solvent extracted.
Sometimes, tars are further processed to recover the more volatile components. If
so, the remaining very heavy residue is usually called pitch (1) (See also Chap-
ter 12).

Tar sands
Tar sands or bituminous sands are several porous rock formations that contain highly
viscous heavy hydrocarbon materials that cannot be recovered by conventional oilrecovery methods, including enhanced oil recovery techniques. At present, the onlypractical method of recovering the hydrocarbons contained in tar sands is mining thetar sands followed by high-temperature retorting. Alternatively, in situ combustion orthermal processing techniques can be used to increase the ﬂuidity of the hydrocarbonsso as to enable their recovery out of the tar sands (1, 2).
Tar sands are characterized by having a relatively coarse porous structure. Some
bituminous rock formations may, however, have a much tighter pore matrix thatmakes the recovery of the hydrocarbons even more difﬁcult. An extreme case isevidenced in oil shales that are typically sedimentary clayish rock structures with a
relatively high organic content (kerogen) that can be thermally decomposed to yieldhydrocarbon-based oils. It is important to note that the hydrocarbons from oil shales,variously denoted as shale oils, cannot be recovered directly from the rock matrix,even using thermal means, but are only the products from the thermal decompositionof the kerogen. Often, shale oils have a relatively high nitrogen content that requiresextensive hydrotreating before it can be used in standard petroleum reﬁning applica-tions.1266 CHAPTER 19
Tar and shale deposits are extensively distributed worldwide and can potentially pro-
vide huge oil reserves for future generations. Some examples vary from the Brea tarpits in California, to the Athabasca tar sands in Canada, to the tar deposits in Trinidador in the Orinoco river valley in Venezuela, to the tar deposits near the CaspianSea, or to the shale oil deposits in Colorado and other parts in the western UnitedStates.

Tetraethyl lead
A former additive used as an anti-knock additive to boost the octane number in
gasoline. It was produced commercially from ethyl chloride. It was used at a dosagein 0–3 ml/gal range depending on the gasoline composition, sulfur content, and leadsensitivity. The use of tetraethyl lead has largely been discontinued worldwide, inparticular as a result of the introduction of catalytic converters to clean up the exhaustfrom internal combustion engines. Use of lead irreversible poisons the oxidationcatalysts used in such converters. Also, lead itself is a highly toxic substance thatwas present in automobile exhaust before it was banned with the advent of catalyticconverters.
Other additives have been proposed or used to replace tetraethyl lead. Manganese
derivatives (e.g., methyl cyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl) were used for sometime, principally in Canada. Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) can be used both as an
octane booster and as a gasoline pool extender, but MTBE has a foul smell and itsuse has fallen off in the United States as a result of ground water contamination fromleaking gasoline tanks. It is, however, still used extensively in other countries alongwith ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME). Passage of a
legislatively mandated oxygenate requirement in the United States led to the increasedusage of ethanol produced by the fermentation of grain, usually corn.
Thermal cracking
The earliest processing of crude oil involved its simple distillation (usually with batch"
"stills) into various fractions that were variously called naphtha, kerosene, gas oil, etc.and with uses often limited to illumination and heating fuels. Neither the quantitynor the quality of the various fractions was particularly good. With the advent ofA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1267
the earlier internal combustion engines it became apparent that the more desirable
naphtha fraction yielded only a poor performance and its availability was verylimited.
Thermal cracking was the ﬁrst commercial process used for the conversion of
petroleum fractions into more useful products. Though largely superseded by otherprocesses (in particular catalytic cracking), thermal cracking was used for many yearsfor the decomposition (cracking) of heavy, high-molecular weight hydrocarbons intosmaller molecules, and is still used commercially in the processing of very heavyfractions, as in visbreaking or coking.
In a different sense, thermal cracking is also the technology that is used universally for
the production of light oleﬁns (ethylene to butenes, in particular) from hydrocarbonfeedstocks that range from ethane, to LPG, to naphthas, and all the way to gas oils.Cracking for the production of oleﬁns is a far more specialized technology that ispractically the basis for the entire petrochemical industry.
Within the reﬁnery environment, thermal cracking started as a batch process in the
early 1900s. Crude oil was heated in a still; the different hydrocarbons vaporizedaccording to their respective boiling points and were then condensed in separatefractions. Gasoline was in increasing demand but the amount recovered by batchdistillation was only a small fraction of the crude fed to the still. A much largerportion remained in the still as a heavy material. William M. Burton of the StandardOil Company is credited with having discovered thermal cracking by applying heat andpressure to decompose part of the residue remaining after gasoline had been boiled off.The result was that the yields of gasoline virtually doubled relative to those obtainedby straight distillation. The early years of thermal cracking were mired in litigationresulting from the timing of the ﬁlings for intellectual property protection. WhileBurton was the ﬁrst to intentionally crack heavy oil by thermal means, his patentapplication ﬁled in the summer of 1912 came much later than a 1909 ﬁling by J. A.Dubbs for a pipe still for the demulsiﬁcation of oil that incidentally also resulted insome thermal cracking. These early Burton cracking stills suffered from signiﬁcantcoking problems; similar coking problems were also encountered in Dubbs’ s pipestills but less so when used with the demulsiﬁcation water. Both technical and legalissues were eventually resolved by Carbon Petroleum (C.P .) Dubbs, son of J. A. Dubbswho, together with Gustav (“ Gasoline Gus” ) Egloff, developed a “ clean circulation”continuous thermal cracking process that largely avoided the formation of undesirablecoke deposits. The success of this process led to the licensing in 1919 of a ﬁrst unit forthe processing of 250 barrels/day to Roxana Petroleum Corporation, a Shell subsidiary,in Wood River, Illinois. By 1923, there were 65 new Dubbs units with total processingcapacity of 42,000 barrels/day and by 1926 there were 107 producing units and another37 under construction. The process was later improved and used extensively for manyyears throughout the world.1268 CHAPTER 19
Figure 19.T.1. Flow schemes of the Dubbs circulation process.
Figure 19.T.1 illustrates a schematic of the Dubbs clean circulation process. The
unit had four major components: a natural gas ﬁred furnace where incoming oil wascirculated through some 60 m of zig-zag tubes and heated to cracking temperature;an enlarged reaction chamber where the oil could remain or “ stew”for a certainresidence time and crack without providing additional heat; a dephlegmator wherevapors from the cracked petroleum, including those of the gasoline product, couldcool and partially condense before being separated; and a reﬂux line through whichsome of the heavier vapors that condensed in the dephlegmator could be reroutedA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1269
back to the feed line and mixed with fresh incoming oil. The recirculation of the
clean material relative to the fresh “ dirty” oil was done at about a three-to-one ratio.The small amount of coke that settled in the reaction chamber could be drained offcontinuously into separate tanks (see also Chapter 11).
Thermal reforming
Thermal reforming is similar to thermal cracking applied to gasoline boiling range
hydrocarbons. Because of consisting of smaller molecules, they are more difﬁcult tocrack and require higher severities, with furnace outlet temperatures of up to about600
◦C. Good per-pass conversions and good octane improvements can be obtained
while coke formation is limited because of the lighter nature of the feedstock."
"An excellent review of thermal processes, both cracking and reforming, can be found
in the Petroleum Processing Handbook, edited by John J. McKetta, Marcel Dekker(1992).
To a large extent thermal reforming has been superseded by catalytic reforming and
thermal cracking by ﬂuidized catalytic cracking (FCC) except as outlined above.
Thermofor
“ Thermofor” is the commercial name of a continuous moving bed process used either
for catalytic cracking or catalytic reforming. A distinctive feature of this process is thatthe catalyst, usually chromia/alumina, ﬂows down through the reactor concurrentlywith the hydrocarbons. A mechanical conveying system is used to circulate the catalystback to the top of the reactors. (1)
1. James G. Speight and Baki ¨Oz¨ um, Petroleum Reﬁning Processes, Marcel Dekker, 2002.
Topping
“ Topping” or “ skimming” is the name used for the distillation of crude oil to remove
the lighter fractions. The crude oil with such fractions removed is sometimes called“ topped crude.”
Crude oil is usually topped only down to some preselected intermediate temperature.
The remaining heavy fraction may still contain substantial amounts of valuable inter-mediate hydrocarbons that can be recovered before the bottoms product is classed asa residuum or residue.1270 CHAPTER 19
Most often the crude oil fractionation unit is a very large, complex column that
separates the crude oil into multiple components: gas, light naphtha, heavy naphtha,kerosene, gas oil, and residue, and not just a topping operation.
Tower fractionation
A fractionation tower is a distillation column, typically with multiple trays or fraction-
ation stages and with at least one feed and two product streams— top and bottom— butoften having also provision for multiple feeds and multiple withdrawal points or sidecuts.
The mechanical design of a fractionation tower is far more complex than just the
speciﬁcation of the operating conditions or the number of theoretical stages. Alsoneeded will be the speciﬁcation and design of its components, such as dimensions,plates or packing, risers, downcomers, internal supports, distributor nozzles, reboilers,condensers, etc.
The fractionation trays are normally divided into a minimum of three sections: one
side is reserved for the reception of the liquid that descends from the plate immediatelyabove, the middle part is reserved for liquid/vapor contacting, and the other side isreserved for the overﬂow of the liquid that will ﬂow to the plate immediately below.These sections can vary in number and shape according to various criteria. Thus,for example, large columns may consist of multiple passes with downcomers andoverﬂows arranged at various positions across the plates. The liquid may ﬂow acrossthe plate in the diagonal direction, or it may reversed by using suitable barriers,or it may ﬂow radially. The downcomers and also the overﬂows may be straightalong a chord of the cylindrical vessel or may consist of circular pipes, among otherpossibilities. The liquid overﬂow may ﬂow over straight, curved, or cylindrical weirs.In exceptionally large columns, the trays may be stepped internally in tiers, with theliquid ﬂowing over weirs from step to step. The intent is always to provide as muchliquid/vapor contacting while avoiding the bypass of liquid across the plate or of vaporthrough the liquid.
One of the oldest types of contactors is the bubble-cap tray (Figure 19.T.2) in which
the ascending vapors are introduced into the descending liquid through a number ofslots or serrations cut along the periphery of cylindrical caps screwed onto the topof the plates and usually arranged according to a triangular pitch. Bubble-cap traysare fairly ﬂexible, but are also fairly expensive to fabricate and install. Other typesof trays have been used. The simplest and possibly also the most common are sievetrays, that consist simply of a stack of perforated plates, always with provisions fordowncomers and overﬂows (Figure 19.T.3).A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1271
Figure 19.T.2. Conventional bubble-cap tray.
Figure 19.T.3. Conventional sieve tray.
The perforations may be in the form of round holes drilled in the plate, usually with a
triangular pitch, or in the form of perforated slots cut or stamped into the trays usinga variety of methods (Kittel plates, Turbogrid trays, etc.). Sieve trays are relativelyinexpensive and are also fairly ﬂexible but have more load limitations than bubblecaps, both in terms of liquid weeping at low vapor loads or of vapor spouting in thecase of low liquid loads. A suitable compromise is sometimes the use of valve trays inwhich metal valves, usually circular or rectangular, are allowed to ascend or descendwithin the liquid depending on the pressure differential exerted by the ascendingvapors.
All these trays offer considerable mechanical complexity and are prone to fouling
when used in “ dirty”service. Other plates like disk-and-doughnut plates, slanted1272 CHAPTER 19"
"cascading plates, etc. can be used for dirty service since they may be more tolerant
to fouling, avoid the accumulation of foulants, or may be easier to clean, but thesetypes of plates usually have much lower contacting efﬁciencies than the traditionaltypes.
It should evident that the correct operation of a fractionation column requires a delicate
equilibrium among all the ﬂows and the pressure gradients across the trays. If, forexample, the liquid capacity of the column is increased, the quantity of liquid on thetrays and in the downspouts will also increase, and so will the pressure differentialacross the plate. This may cause even more liquid to back up the downspouts andthe system becomes unstable. The outcome usually is that the column ﬁlls up withliquid or, in common terms, it becomes ﬂooded. It is, therefore, important to design
the column for operation at a point sufﬁciently distant from ﬂooding— usually about
70% or 80%— that this situation will not arise. Flooding can be related to a number
of parameters: ﬂow rate of the liquid or vapor is but one of them; another could be theseparation between plates that affects the static pressure head, and also the frothingcharacteristics, if any, of the liquid. It is usually recommended to maintain a trayspacing equal at least to twice the height of the liquid in the downspout, but theserules are often violated in order to save in column height and cost. Other solutions thatallow for the reduction of the spacing between trays may include the use of multipledowncomer trays, often denoted as MD trays (Figure 19.T.4).
MD trays may have different layouts with various downcomer arrangements available
that can vary from parallel to cross ﬂows at 90
◦angles. In the latter case, the trays have
two-fold symmetry around two centerlines, which intersect at 90◦. This symmetry
arises from the rotation by 90◦of the inlet downcomers with respect to the outlet
downcomers on the next tray. This rotation also forces the liquid to ﬂow across thetray in a 90
◦turn. MD trays allow for relatively short tray-to-tray distances. Several
diameters up to 12–15 m have been commercialized. Multiple upcomer (MU) traysalso exist and are often used in liquid–liquid extraction applications.
In all of the above the separations are effected by contacting the liquid and the vapor
across mechanical (usually metallic) discrete units (trays or plates). Another possi-bility is to contact descending liquid with ascending vapor over an extended surfacelike that provided by the presence of a coarse or porous packing within the distillationvessel. Such packings usually have uniform metallic, ceramic, or polymeric structureslike Raschig rings, or Berl saddles, or may even consist of rigid interlaced packingstructures (usually metallic but sometimes also ceramic). The number of stages in thiscase is not discrete as in a tray column but, instead, is calculated on the basis of theheight equivalent of a theoretical plate (HETP) or the height of a transfer unit (HTU).
These columns usually have no upcomers or downcomers or other mechanical di-viders (except for provisions to hold the packing in discrete segments for mechanicalA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1273
Figure 19.T.4. Typical layout of an MD tray.
purposes). Flooding is also a limitation that the designers have to contend with in
packed columns (see also Chapter 18).
True boiling point (TBP)
The true boiling point distillation curve is obtained in a laboratory apparatus that is
insulated from the surroundings. The outer jacket is maintained at substantially thesame temperature as the temperature of the vapor within the column so that no heat isgained or lost across the fractionation stages and the column is as close to adiabaticas possible. This is often done by circulating heated air through the jacket but it canalso be approached by carefully controlled zone heating. Depending on the materialbeing distilled, true boiling point distillation may require operation under vacuum, sothe apparatus is usually designed to accommodate such situations.
Distillation may be conducted either at a constant or at a variable rate. If operated
at a constant rate, a smooth curve is obtained that reﬂects the variation in the stilltemperature as a function of the percentage distilled overhead. In the variable ratemethod the rate of distillation is adjusted depending on the amount of material thatboils at each temperature. In all cases, sufﬁcient reﬂux should be provided to keep1274 CHAPTER 19
the packing wet and at the maximum rate that the column will tolerate without ﬂood-
ing.
TBP distillation differs from an ASTM or Engler distillation in a number of ways. In
an ASTM distillation, the hydrocarbons are distilled at a uniform rate of about 5 cc per"
"min. The distillate is condensed and the temperature of the vapor when the ﬁrst dropof condensate drips from the condenser is recorded as the Initial Boiling Point (IBP).The vapor temperature is then recorded at each successive 10% interval. When 95%had distilled the temperature of the still may have to be increased and the maximumtemperature is recorded as the end point (EP). There is virtually no fractionation inan ASTM distillation. The hydrocarbons do not distill one by one according to theirboiling points but only as successively higher and higher boiling mixtures.
Various correlations exist to relate TBP , ASTM, and other laboratory distillation
procedures (1) (See also Chapter 1 and Chapter 3).

UOP K
TheUOP K,o rt h e Watson K,o rt h e Watson characterization factor, is a parameter
identiﬁed by Kenneth Watson (1) who deﬁned it as follows:
K=[TB]1/3/(sp.gr .)
where [T B]1/3represents the cube root of the average molal boiling point of the
hydrocarbon mixture [T B] in degrees Rankine (◦R=◦F+460), divided by the
speciﬁc gravity at 60◦F , relative to water at 60◦F.
This is a correlation parameter based on the observation that K ∼12.5 corresponds to
parafﬁnic materials while K ∼10.0 indicates a highly aromatic material. It provides
a means for roughly identifying the nature of a feedstock solely on the basis of two
observable physical parameters.
The characterization factor has also been related to viscosity, aniline point, molecular
weight, critical temperature, percentage of hydrocarbons, etc. so it can be estimatedusing a number of laboratory methods (2).

Urea dewaxing
A process for producing low pour point oils in which straight-chain parafﬁns are
removed from the feedstock by complexing them with urea to form a crystallineadduct that can be separated by ﬁltration.
It is interesting that, in the adducts, urea forms spiral structures connected by hydro-
gen bonds in a hexagonal crystalline structure with an internal channel diameter ofabout 5 angstrom into which only molecules with a smaller cross-sectional dimen-sion can ﬁt (1). In a sense, this behavior mimics the separation of n-parafﬁns fromhydrocarbons with 5A molecular sieves that is extensively used in industry either forthe production of heavy n-parafﬁns or, in combination with parafﬁn isomerizationfor the enhancement of the octane number of hydrocarbons in the gasoline boilingrange. Heavy n-parafﬁns can be cracked to linear α-oleﬁns or can be catalytically
dehydrogenated to linear internal oleﬁns; both are extensively used in the detergentindustry as feedstocks for the production of detergent alcohols or of biodegradablelinear alkylbenzenes. (See also Chapter 12.)

V
Vacuum distillation unit
Vacuum distillation unit refers to the further distillation of the residue portion of
atmospheric distillation of the crude. The boiling curve range of this portion of thecrude is too high to permit further vaporization at atmospheric pressure. Crackingof the residue would occur long before any temperature level for effective distilla-tion would be reached. By reducing the pressure, however, the danger of crackingin further heating the residue oil for further distillation is reduced. Figure 19.V .1 isa process diagram of a typical crude oil vacuum distillation unit. These units op-erate at overhead pressures as low as 10 mmHg. Under these conditions, the hotresidue feed from the atmospheric distillation unit is partially vaporized in a ﬁredheater and enters the vacuum distillation tower at temperatures around 700
◦F . The
hot vapors rise up the tower to be successively condensed by a cooled internal reﬂuxstream moving down the tower as was the case in the atmospheric distillation unit.The condensed distillate streams are taken off as side stream distillates. There is nooverhead distillate stream in this case. The high vacuum condition met with in theseunits is produced by a series of steam ejectors attached to the unit overhead system.1276 CHAPTER 19
Figure 19.V .1. Vacuum distillation
A low-pressure drop within the tower allows for a ﬂash zone pressure sufﬁciently
low to accommodate the ﬂash temperature of the feed below its cracking tempera-ture (i.e., around the 700–750
◦F). Typical side stream products from this unit are as
follows:
Top side stream Light vacuum gas oil 690–750◦F cut point
2nd side stream Heavy vacuum gas oil 750–985◦F cut point
Residue Bitumen +985◦F cut point
The low-pressure drop tower internals are beds of proprietary grid packing. A portion"
"of the respective side stream draw off is routed through coolers to be returned as acool pumparound reﬂux stream to the packing section above each draw off tray. Thisunit is further described and discussed in Chapter 3.
Visbreaking process
The visbreaking process is a mild thermal cracking of crude oil residues. It is used to
reduce the viscosity of vacuum residue to meet the fuel oil speciﬁcation. The processconﬁguration is very similar to the conventional once through thermal cracker exceptA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1277

for the routing of the recovery products from the fractionator. Figure 19.V .2 shows
the conﬁguration of a typical visbreaker.
The cabin type heater has two sections: a heating section and a soaking section. A ﬁre
wall separates the two sections, a conﬁguration similar to any thermal cracker. Theresidue feed enters the heater section together with high-pressure steam and is heatedto a temperature of around 780–800
◦F before crossing over the separating ﬁre wall to
the soaking section. Here it is allowed to remain for a calculated period of time at atemperature slightly higher than the temperature it reached in the heater section. Somemild cracking occurs so as to produce some range of lower boiling material. The heaterefﬂuent leaves the heater to be quenched with cold fuel oil product before entering thefractionator. Unlike a thermal cracker, only the naphtha and lighter cracked distillateis taken off as an overhead product. There will be no middle distillate cut in this case.That material which has been formed by the cracking mechanism will remain in thevisbroken bottom product as fuel oil. The design of the ﬁred heater is the same as forany thermal cracker. Section of Chapter 11, describes ‘ The Soaking V olume Factor’concept.
Viscosity
The viscosity of any petroleum product is a measure of its resistance to ﬂow. This
measurement is important in many facets of process design and indeed is an essentialquality of many ﬁnished products.1278 CHAPTER 19
Chapter 16 describes the test method for kinematic viscosity. There are two basic
viscosity parameters. They are:
Dynamic or absolute viscosity
Kinematic viscosity
Both are related since the kinematic viscosity may be obtained by dividing the dynamic
viscosity by the mass density. The metric unit for viscosity is called the poise (P). The
unit most often used in the petroleum industry for this measure is the centipoise (cP)
which is the poise divided by 100. This dimensions of the poise are:
gram
cm×sec.
The kinematic viscosity dimension in English units is the square foot per second.
And in metric units is square centimeter per second called the stoke. In the petroleum
reﬁning industry, the stoke divided by 100, called the centistoke, is the unit most
often used. When the terms centipoise and centistokes are used the mass density isnumerically equal to the speciﬁc gravity.
Various types of instruments are available to determine viscosity in other terms. These
terms are SSU which is Saybolt Seconds Universal and SSF which is Seconds SayboltFurol. All viscosity terms can be converted by factors to one another. These factorsmay be found in most engineering data books such as Cameron Hydraulic Data andThe GPSA (Gas Processors Suppliers Association) Engineering Hand Book. Viscosityis used extensively in product blending and quality control of petroleum products. Inblending for viscosity, a blending index concept must be used. That is, one cannotblend directly using just volumetric proportions. The viscosity indices are given anddiscussed in Chapter 1 and again in Chapter 2.

Waste disposal facilities
All process plants including oil reﬁneries produce large quantities of toxic and/or
ﬂammable materials during periods of plant upset or emergencies. Properly designedﬂare and slop handling systems are therefore essential to the plant operation. Thissection describes and discusses typical disposal systems currently in use in the oilreﬁning industry where the hydrocarbon is immiscible with water. Where the chemicalis miscible in water special separation systems must be used.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1279
Figure 13.17 in Chapter 13 shows a completely integrated waste disposal system for
the light end section of an oil reﬁnery. Further description and discussion of thesedisposal systems is given in the following sections of that chapter:
rBlow-down and slop disposal
rFlares
rWater efﬂuent treating
Blow-down and slop
This system generally consists of the following drums:
rNon condensable blow-down drum
rCondensable blow-down drum
rWater disengaging drum
Particular emphasis is put on the level control of liquid in these drums.
The ﬂare
Vapors collected in a closed safety system are disposed of by burning at a safe"
"location. The facilities used for burning are called ﬂares. The most common ﬂaresused in industry today are:
rThe elevated ﬂare
rThe multi jet ground ﬂare
The elevated ﬂare is used where some degree of smoke abatement is required. Theﬂare itself operates from the top of a stack usually in excess of 150 ft high. Steam isinjected into the gas stream to be burnt to complete combustion and thereby reducethe smoke emission.
The multi jet ground ﬂare is selected where luminosity is a problem. For example at
locations near housing sites. In this type of ﬂare, the vapors are burned within theﬂare stack thus considerably reducing the luminosity. Steam is again used in this typeof ﬂare to reduce the smoke emission.
Efﬂuent water treating facilities
This section of the offsite systems deals with the treating of waste water accumulated in
a chemical process complex before it leaves the complex. Over the years, requirementsfor safeguarding the environment have demanded close control on the quality ofefﬂuents discharged from chemical and oil reﬁning plants. This includes efﬂuentsthat contain contaminants that can affect the quality of the atmosphere and those thatcan be injurious to plant and other life in river waters and the surrounding seas. Efﬂuent1280 CHAPTER 19
management in the oil industry has therefore acquired a position of importance and
responsibility to meet these environmental control demands.
Water efﬂuents that are discharged from the process and other units are collected
for treating and removal or conversion of the injurious contaminants. In most oilreﬁneries imported water in the form of ship ballast water is also collected on shorefor treatment before discharging back to the sea. Figure 13.26 is a schematic of thewater efﬂuent treating system for a major European oil reﬁnery. More details anddiscussion on waste water disposal are given in Chapter 14.
Water systems
The major water systems generated in most chemical plants are:
rCooling water
rTreated water for boiler feed water (BFW)
Potable water as raw water is usually drawn from municipal supply. Where water is
required for cleaning or drinking this potable water is used without further processing.
Cooling waterThe cooling water system is a circulating one. There is a cold supply line with an
associated warmer return line. Chapter 13 describes and discusses a typical reﬁnerycooling water supply and return. Figure 13.31 in that chapter shows such a system insome detail.
The water returned to the cooling tower by the return header enters the top of the
cooling tower and ﬂows down across the tower internals counter current to an air ﬂow,either induced or forced by fans passing up through the tower. The water cooled bythe air ﬂow is collected in the cooling tower basin. Make up water (usually potablewater) is added to the basin under level control. Vertical cooling water circulatingwater pumps take suction from the cooling tower basin sump to deliver the waterinto the distribution header. The supply header pressure is kept at around 30 psigand, very often in large plants covering long distances, booster stations are installedat predetermined locations to maintain the supply header pressure. The return ﬂowis collected from each user into the return header and ﬂows back to the coolingtower.
Boiler feed water treatingAll water contains impurities no matter from what source the water comes from.
Appendix 13.2 of Chapter 13, gives a listing of the common impurities found inA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1281
water for industrial use. When it comes to generating steam and particularly high-
pressure steam, these impurities become problematic. Appendix 13.2 also provides adescription of the effect of these impurities on steam generators and gives the normalmeans of treating. In general there are three types of soluble impurities naturallypresent in water and which must be removed or converted in order to make the watersuitable for boiler feed. These are:
rScale forming impurities
rCompounds that cause foaming
rDissolved gases
Solid build up in the boiler itself is removed or kept at a low level by blow down.Figure 13.32 of Chapter 13 gives an example of boiler blow down.
There are two types of external boiler feed water treatment in common use in the
petroleum reﬁning industry. These are.
rThe “ hot lime” process
This is a water softening process which uses a hot lime contact to induce a precipitateof the compounds contributing to the hardness.
rThe ion exchange processes
As the name implies, this process exchanges undesirable ions contained in the rawwater with more desirable ones that produce acceptable BFW . The ion exchangematerial needs to be regenerated after a period of operation. The operating periodwill differ from process to process and will depend to some extent on the amount ofimpurities in the water and the required purity of the treated water. Regeneration isaccomplished in three steps:
rBack washing"
"rRegenerating the resin bed with regenerating chemicals
rRinsing
These two systems are described in detail in Chapter 4.
X, Y, Z
Xylenes
These are aromatic compounds which are coupled with benzene, toluene, and ethyl
benzene as the major products from a petrochemical petroleum reﬁnery. These com-pounds as a whole are usually designated as BTX. The process begins in a conventional1282 CHAPTER 19
reﬁnery with the catalytic reforming of a high naphthene content naphtha. This naph-
tha may be the product of a hydrocracker. The reformate is much richer in aromaticsthan that used for gasoline production. After stabilizing, the reformate enters an ex-traction unit where residual parafﬁns are removed, and the rich aromatic stream isrouted to an aromatic splitter. Depending on the severity of the reformes the splittermay be located ahead of the extraction unit since the xylenes may not require extrac-tion. The benzene and toluene components are taken off as overhead distillate and thebottom product enters a super fractionation unit, the xylene splitter. Here ethyl ben-zene, para-xylene, and meta-xylene are taken off as overhead distillates. Para-xylenemay be separated from this overhead distillate by absorption or crystallization, or maycontinue with the remaining distillate to enter an isomerization unit, where they areisomerized into a rich ortho-xylene stream. Para-xylene product is by far the morevaluable and important isomer of the C
8aromatics.
Ortho-xylene stream leaves as the bottom product of the isomerizer splitter towerto be returned to the xylene splitter super fractionator tower. The bottom productof this tower is the ortho xylene product. Further details and description is given inChapter 12. Figure 18 of this chapter, shows a process conﬁguration of a typical BTXprocess. Ortho-xylene is used extensively in the production of phthalates, para-xyleneis used in the production of terephtualic acid and polyesters, and ethylbenzene is usedin the production of styrene.

An example of an exercise using linear programming
1332Linear programming aids decisions
on reﬁnery conﬁgurations

Mathematical modeling using linear programming can solve many problems associ-
ated with reﬁnery operation and planning. The technique, compared with the cost ofan error of judgment, represents only an insigniﬁcant ﬁnancial outlay.
It is becoming more and more evident that there is a deﬁnite economic incentive to
studying problems associated with reﬁnery planning by mathematical modeling usinglinear programming.
Ever-increasing investment costs associated with the tightening of product speciﬁca-
tions, changing crude slates, alterations in the energy pattern in marketing countries,and expanding petrochemical requirements, all make an error in decision judgment ofreﬁnery processing increasingly costly. Whereever this basic risk can be reduced bymodern mathematical techniques, the potential saving in capital or investment couldmake the ﬁnancial outlay on such a study insigniﬁcant.
What follows is a description of a typical reﬁnery simulation study but this is only one
of an increasing number of problems that can be solved by mathematical modelingusing linear programming.
Wider impetus. The application of linear programming techniques using comput-
ers has long been used in the oil reﬁning industry for the development of planning
and operating policies. With the introduction of modern high-speed, large-capacitycomputers, this technique grew considerably within the industry.
Brieﬂy, linear programming is the developing of linear sub models which mathemat-
ically describe many of the various operations within the industry, such as reﬁneryprocessing, crude and product ﬂows, marketing demands. etc. These linear sub modelsare inter-related to build up a complete mathematical model of the speciﬁc operation.By the use of the computer, the equations within the model can be solved to optimize,on a selective basis, the operation under study.
13331334 A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS
The growth of mathematical models using this technique provides management with a
means of making an increasing number of decisions which do have a calculable basis.Thus, in many cases, the need for decisions based only on individual experience or‘ feel’ , with its obvious inherent dangers, is being eliminated.
One such study illustrates a relatively simple reﬁnery problem application of mathe-
matical modeling and linear programming techniques.
Deﬁnition of problem
The client, wished to build a new reﬁnery. It had already executed a marketing survey"
"in the area and could specify quantity and quality, together with prices, of the productswhich would meet its market requirements. Its management now had to decide theeconomic optimum reﬁnery conﬁguration that would satisfy its crude and productslate. At this stage only one type of crude was intended for the reﬁnery, and tosome extent this simpliﬁed the problem. However, to satisfy other considerations,management required the solutions to the following premises:
rThe reﬁnery conﬁgurations, which would satisfy a MINIMUM investment, whenproducing a high volume of gasoline with and without a low sulfur content limita-tion of the fuel oil. All other products were to meet quality and quantity require-ments.
rThe reﬁnery conﬁgurations which would give the MAXIMUM return on investmentto satisfy a ﬁxed crude throughput with no quantity restriction on the product slate,and then to satisfy a limited restriction on the product slate with no limit to thecrude throughput.
Such a problem lends itself readily to linear programming and thus a reﬁnery simu-lation model was developed to solve these two premises.
Process consideration
The ﬁrst step in constructing the model was to establish as many processing units as
could conceivably contribute to the solution of the problem. For instance, with suchlarge requirements of gasoline there would obviously be required a cracking unit ofsome kind. Thus, the model included a reformer, ﬂuid cracker, hydrocracker, cokerand visbreaker. Some combination of these processes must satisfy the premises of theproblem.
Similarly, the lower sulfur content of the fuel oil would probably require some form
of residue treating. Thus two severity desulfurizers for both short and long residuerespectively were included together with a process for hydrocracking these residues.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1335
The many process units now included were then deﬁned in terms of feed streams,
product yields and quality, and operating costs, all based as a percentage on the feedstreams. This part of the study was the ﬁrst important step which required the expertiseof specialists. This data forms the basis for the rational solution to the problem, andtherefore it was necessary to be accurate and to augment prediction and theory withrealism and technical experience.
For instance, in arriving at the yields from the crude and vacuum units the effect of
fractionation on the product yield was considered. Realistic ASTM distillation gapswere used that could be met by a commercial distillation unit.
In the ﬂuid catalytic cracking units a more sophisticated approach was needed to
correlate the yields from the many feedstocks which would be independent of thermo-dynamic considerations. Here a base case feed yield data (in this case a straight runwaxy distillate) at a conversion of 75% using zeolite catalyst was used.
Yields from all other feedstocks (including those which had been hydrotreated) were
related by ﬁrst principle kenetic and thermodynamic considerations to the base case.A short and simple computer program was used for this purpose, and it was alsopossible to simulate the effect of changing the quantity of zeolite catalyst by thismeans. The results of these computerized calculations were checked against existingplant data before being incorporated into the study.
In other processes such as hydrocracking, hydrotreating, visbreaking, etc., care was
taken that only proven yield data or correlations were used.
Catalytic reforming yield data was obtained from a correlation which related yield
to severity for a basic naphthene and aromatic content of the feed-stock. A wholerange of severity operations from 95 to 105 O.N. (Research) clear was encompassedin the study. Spot checks of the predicted yield by this method against actual yieldfrom an operating unit showed that the method was viable and acceptably accu-rate.
Basic economic data
Having developed the physical yield structure of the ‘ model’ , the next step was to
complete the basic data by providing investment and maintenance costs.There is, of course, a considerable wealth of plant cost data available to a contractor
from the projects he has completed over the years. However, there is always the needto analyze these costs, and to review them in terms of up to date material and laborcost changes.1336 A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS
For this study, a large amount of cost data was statistically analyzed for each type of
plant. From this analysis, a base cost and an empirical expotential factor was developedin order to relate a total investment cost to capacity in as realistic a way as possible.This realtionship can be expressed mathematically in a non-linear form.
C=C
o(T/To)k
where
C=Investment cost
Co=Base cost at a base throughput T o
T=New throughput
K=An empirical constant
The inclusion of a non-linear form for investment costs in a linear program requiredspecial consideration, and we shall see later how this was utilized."
"In the models, many of the units considered were licensed processes, for which a
royalty would be paid. A value in terms of a paid up royalty in dollars per barrel ofthroughput was included in the investment. Where chemicals and catalysts were used,the ﬁrst inventory of these was also included as part of investment.
Chemicals and loss of catalyst was considered as an operating cost based on usage as
were utilities. Labor, a ﬁxed operating cost, was included with the return on investment.Maintenance cost was ﬁxed as a percentage of the total maintenance cost.
Model Development
At the same time as the process and cost data were being generated, the basic form
that the model would ﬁnally take was also being developed. This consisted of deﬁningthe various optional routes of each stream within the simulated reﬁnery model.
The optional routing of the streams was carefully selected. This selection had to satisfy
at least one of two requirements. Firstly, would such a routing actually contribute tosatisfying the product slate and the premises of the problem? Secondly, would such arouting be feasible under actual operating conditions?
Just as a reﬁnery is described by the units of which it is comprised, so also was
the reﬁnery linear model described. Here, each processing unit was considered asubmodel in itself and these submodels were deﬁned by their process and economicdata.
These data were arranged in tabular from which were easily accessed and listed in
recognizable terminology. An example of a submodel tabulation as used in this studyA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1337

is shown in Table E.1. From this tabulation, a matrix generator, called GAMMA1,2
was used to assemble the many submodels into a complete LP matrix. The matrix
was solvable by a linear programming system called OMEGA3. These tabular input
arrays were also used by the solution report writers as we shall see later.
This complete mathematical model of the reﬁnery was displayed by an equation listing
of the entire contents of the data. The equations showed the inter-relationships of themany variables, including the reﬁnery streams, the blending constraints, the unit toinvestment ties, etc. These were also in a form which was ecognizable to the engineersworking on the project.
Having now assembled all the data in a manner usable for linear programming, it was
necessary to check it for errors. Various computer techniques had been developed for1338 A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS
this purpose, and these, together with a secondary check by the process engineers,
substantially eliminated the possibilities of obvious error and invalid data.
However, as an added safeguard, a ﬁnal checkout was carried out by actually solving
a test case. These results were scrutinized to ensure that the output gave a realisticreﬁnery conﬁguration and that all was in balance.
Optimizing and other techniques
A major value of linear programming is that once environment is reﬂected within
a LP framework, this environment can be optimized. In this study, optimizationcould be accomplished either by maximizing proﬁt or minimizing expense, and inthis speciﬁc case, the former was selected. It should be emphasized that optimiza-tion can only be achieved for the environment reﬂected in the model. Great carewas taken therefore to reﬂect all the meaningful, worthwhile options known to beavailable.
There are many reﬁnery variables that are of a non-linear nature. Among these
non-linearities are the effects of blending on motor gasoline, the capital expendi-tures in relation to size of the units, and many severity effects within the variousprocesses. When these effects could be described on a cost basis by a CONVEX
curve, they were generally included in the model as linear segments of a curve (seeFig. E.1).
If the severity to value of product relationship was a concave curve, only one variable"
"could be used to reﬂect changing severity. This by nature has to be an estimate witha review of the estimate upon solution.
The blend to octane relationship is highly non-linear and a new approach was used
to reﬂect this in the model. This approach had considerable advantage over the oldertechniques in that it was relatively easy to understand and use.
It was capable of reﬂecting the value of octane susceptibility to the individual com-
ponents available for the blends. It also had the capability to represent accuratelymore than one type of octane (i.e., research, motor, road, etc.) with these effects alsoreﬂected back to the various components.
This technique required the aid of a recursive routine to update various model coef-
ﬁcients that reﬂected the actual susceptibilities at the solution point. The model thenre-optimized with the recalculated octane for various blendstocks and again they werechecked. This was repeated until no further change was required.A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1339

The non-linearities of the capital expenditures are concave in nature. Thus, the initial
investment cost estimate was updated by means of a recursive routine which calculatedthe investment cost per unit of activity at the solution level. This recursive routineis described in detail next. Among the various factors that could be considered ininvestment costs are total investment cost to size relationships, offsites, insurances,taxes (both income and property), overhead, maintenance, labor, royalties, escalation,plant or service factors, depreciation, and the expected economic life of the variousfacilities.
Solution approach
In a study of capital expenditure (commonly called facilities planning) such as this,
there are many possible mathematical techniques which can be used to obtain asolution. Experience has shown, however, that linear programming on a computer isby far the most economic approach to solving this type of problem. By this method,most of the many possible solutions can be examined quickly and effectively. Beforediscussing the solution approach used in this study, let us quickly review the invest-ment environment for any typical reﬁnery unit. This is illustrated in a simpliﬁed formin Fig. E.2.1340 A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS
Figure E.2. Cost parameters for any typical reﬁnery unit.
The total cost curve, on linear graph paper, shows that as a volume throughput is
increased, the total cost of a unit will increased, However, the plot of unit volume cost($/bpcd) against throughput shows the reverse; that is, the cost per unit of throughputwill decrease as the volume of throughput increases. It is this type of cost that isreﬂected in an LP model.
Figure E.2 also shows a plot of the average cost slope and the incremental cost slope at
a given throughput level. This average cost slope includes all the costs associated with
a particular unit. The slope is linear and must pass through the origin. The incremental
costslope reﬂects the change in cost per unit throughput over a short range. This slope
is always tangential to the total cost curve at any throughput under consideration.
It can be seen that the average cost gives the model ‘ greater than to be expected’
incentive for changing the size of the unit, while the incremental cost curve on the
other hand gives the expected incentive. The incremental cost ignores all ﬁxed costsat the solution level, and consists mainly of the expected return on investment.
The technique used in this study was to begin the solution by establishing a very
nominal cost on all units. This allowed any unit to be chosen in the solution. Once theLP had selected an optimal unit conﬁguration with those nominal costs, a recursiveprogram for investment cost estimating was used to determine average cost of the
units at the solution throughputs. These average costs were based on a minimumA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1341
return of investment, and an expected economic life calculated on a discounted cash
ﬂow basis.
These new calculated costs were then substituted for the original arbitrary cost in
the model. This average costing tended to delete the very unrealistically small unitsthat may have been chosen in the unrestricted conﬁguration. Again, the model wasoptimized with these new costs.
The recursions and solutions were repeated until no further cost, conﬁguration or size
changes were required. All the items described above were carried out in a singlecomputer run, and this solution was saved on tape and reported. Close scrutiny ofthe results then followed to make sure that they were reasonable and that there wasno automatically restricted unit that might have been selected had a different solutionpath been used.
A second step was then commenced which restored the solution of the ﬁrst step based
on the average cost to the computer. The investment costs for the conﬁguration were"
"then recalculated using the incremental cost concept. This incremental cost required
no return on investment and an inﬁnite economic life was assumed for the units. Theonly costs that were recognized in this step were the incremental maintenance foreach unit. Therefore, the building costs did not economically suppress the size ofunits or the total investment. The unit sizes and total investment were optimized onthe premised product slate and available raw materials. A similar recursive step wasagain used, but this time it included only the incremental maintenance cost.
The model contains a variable that carries the sum total of the investment. This
variable is updated at the same time as the unit costs are updated by the recursiveoperations described. Using this total investment variable it was possible to step down(paramatrize) on the total investment, until a feasible solution was no longer possible.An infeasible solution in this context is that in which the cash ﬂow for the conﬁgurationbecomes less than zero.
As the total investment are reduced, the unit sizes, the product slates and raw ma-
terials are changed within the framework of the overall premises. Therefore, by thisparametric sweep, the reﬁnery conﬁgurations (both in size and form) could now befound which would satisfy the following requirements:
rMaximum investment
rMaximum return on investment
rMaximum expected cash ﬂow
rMinimum investment
The results of each parametric step were reported and documented.1342 A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS

Solution analysis
Besides the specially designed report writing technique already discussed, the LP also
has a standard number of solution reports and these are generally of a more technicalnature. Although of great value, they do not readily lend themselve to immediate andapparent interpretation. It is imperative, however, that some members of a team usingan LP can read and interpret these outputs, particularly as one major use of thesereports is to highlight any obvious errors that may have been overlooked. Some ofthese reports used in this study were called the BI/DJ and Range output. They warranta brief explanation.
The BI/DJ output (see Table E.2) gives the solution level activities (BI) for all the
variables that were selected in the optimum solution. For those variables that were notselected, the cost or decrease in proﬁt that would occur were they forcibly includedin the conﬁguration (or basis) is given by the DJ value.
The Range information is a complementary report to the BI/DJ. The ranges give the
incremental volume associated with the DJ’ s and the cost ranges associated with thebasis variables. The valuable use of the BI/DJ and the range ﬁles can best be expressedby an example, using the extracts shown in Tables E.2, E.3, and E.4.
Consider the component CYO that has been selected in the conﬁguration. (The code
FU/CYO in this case indicates that the reﬁnery stream CYO is routed to fuel.) Thequantity of the stream CYO that enters the fuel blend is 1,457 bpcd. Now considerthe component ‘ HBM’ . This has not been selected in the basis, and this stream hasa DJ value (i.e., no preﬁx). To route the ‘ HBM’stream to fuel forcibly would cost$0.6095/bbl.

Because the FU/CYO item is selected in the basis, the range data for this is found in
the primal range output (Table E.4). Interpreting the statement for this stream in thisoutput means that optimum volume levels of the solution would not have changedeven if the variable had a very small negative incentive (less than $0.000001). Further,
the situation would not have changed even if this variable had a positive cost incentive
of up to $0.02807/bbl.
Let us now look at the ‘ HBM’ variable. this was not chosen in the basis and it appears"
"in the dual range output (Table E.5). Interpreting the data for this item shows that toroute ‘ HBM’to fuel would cost 60 cents/bbl for the ﬁrst 549 bpcd. All that is knownthereafter is that the cost per barrel over 549 bpcd would increase.

The example chosen here describes the economic analysis of two optional streams
which can be logically routed ao a fuel blend. It is emphasized that the BI/DJ andrange outputs, however, contain similar information for allvariables whether process
units, reﬁnery streams, product speciﬁcations, etc. contained in the model.
Computer report writer
The data generated by the computer contains all facts relevant to the solution. However,
to all but a few highly trained people the data in this form would be meaningless andof no practical use. The LP system used in this study contained a specially designedA DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS 1345
report writer, coded in a language called DART4,5. This converted and assembled the
computer LP output into management orientated reports that could easily be read and
understood without sacriﬁcing the relevant technical content.
In this particular case, too, much of data, as produced by the report writing sequence,
was in such a form as to be reproducible and able to be included in the ﬁnal documen-tation. Table E.5 shows an example of such a report. (Note: the actual calculated datain this example has been deleted).
For the parametric series discussed above, a special report writing technique was
developed which allowed each succeeding parametric step to be repeated in a casestacking fashion. This type of report was considerably condensed from the reportsdescribed earlier.
Final documentation
When the solutions to the four premises of the problem had been determined, using
the techniques described, they existed, hidden among the mass of tabulated data thatformed the computer output. It remained now to extract the pertinent section of theoutput and to present it so that the objective of the study, which was to providemanagement with information to make a good decision, could be achieved. The mostcommon means of doing this— and the one chosen on this occasion— is by a written
report in which the data is summarized, discussed and the conclusion stated.
Although it is not proposed to discuss the general techniques of technical report
writing here, some fundamental requirements of a complex presentation such as thisare worth highlighting. This report had to satisfy two principal functions. The ﬁrst,to present as succinctly as possible the conclusions, and the interpretation of thoseconclusions, for the convenience of the client’ s management. Secondly, it had topresent all the back-up data in as short a form as possible that would be necessary toenable the client’ s own staff to check and conﬁrm the conclusions reached.
This second function was satisﬁed in this report in the form of an appendix. This
included copies of the actual pertinent computer printouts complete with tabularlisting of the submodels, economic balances, etc. These data were further augmentedby the summary of the economic and yield output for the respective parametric runs.
The main body of the report consisted of a short description of the study, together"
"with discussion of the result. The results were however succinctly described by twoillustrations for each of the four cases of the problem. The ﬁrst illustration showedthe ultimate reﬁnery complex which satisﬁed the premise of the case studied, and atypical example is shown in Fig. E.3. The second illustration, typiﬁed by Fig. E.4,1346 A DICTIONAR Y OF TERMS AND EXPRESSIONS
Figure E.3. Typical ﬁnal optimum conﬁguration.
Figure E.4. Bar chart summarising economic studies for conﬁguration in Fig E.3.BIBLIOGRAPHY 1347
gave the basic economic trend for this conﬁguration and also described the yields of
major products for each parametric case.
The charts shown are meant only as an example and the ﬁgures are ﬁctitious or have
been purposely deleted. However, it can be seen that Fig. E.3 describes the result interms of the processes that must be built to satisfy the premise. Figure E.4 showswhy such a conﬁguration is the optimum, and what the ultimate product slate wouldlook like. Such a chart also gives the client’ s management an opportunity to assessquickly the effect of changing a basic premise such as maximum return on investmentor minimum capital investment.
