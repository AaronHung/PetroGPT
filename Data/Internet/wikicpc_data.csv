History[edit]

Early history[edit]

Shanghai as

Republic of China (ROC, then on Mainland China). With the

Kuomintang's retreat to Taiwan after the

Chinese Civil War, CPC was transferred from the Council of Resources to the

Ministry of Economic Affairs. The company merged all relevant facilities and companies (Japanese 6th Naval Fuel Depot,

Teikoku Oil,

Nippon Oil, etc.) in Taiwan. Its main businesses include surveying, extracting, refining, transporting, and selling petroleum. It also produces various chemicals and has retail outlets all over Taiwan. CPC's fixing of petrol prices helped Taiwan through the

1970s Energy Crisis

Democratization and modern history[edit]

Formosa Plastics Group's launch of

Formosa Petrochemical Corporation (台塑石化). In February 2007, the company's board approved name change to ""

[1]

PetroChina, the

China state-run corporation which also has the Chinese name 中國石油, and was part of government efforts to

de-Sinicize Taiwanese entities which have ""China"" in their names.  However, the

Kuomintang political party argued that the name change is not valid because no legislation was passed in the legislature to support it. KMT believes that the approval of the

Legislative Yuan is required before a state-owned company can change its name.

[2]

In December 2018, production started at the Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility in Australia, which is the world's largest floating production structure. The company holds shares alongside investors Shell, Inpex Corporation, and Korea Gas Corporation.[3][4]

In 2019 a Norwegian tanker named Front Altair carrying a cargo of naphtha for CPC Corporation was attacked in the Gulf of Oman. The entire NT$1.07b (US$34m) cargo was lost but the crew escaped unharmed and the cargo was insured. After insurance CPC Corporation incurred direct costs of NT$8m (US$254,000) associated with the incident.[5] The cargo represented two days of Taiwanese consumption but had minimal impacts as the company had 45 day supply in reserve.[6]

carbon-neutral liquified-natural gas arrived at CPC's Yung-An LNG Terminal in

Kaohsiung. The shipment was the first in a new program designed to render fuel imports carbon-neutral by buying

carbon credits on the global market. The initial purchase from

Shell Eastern Trading was for credits certified by the UN's

REDD+ program which supports forests in developing countries.

[7]

In 2020 CPC saw the first shipment of crude from the Chadian Oryx field, CPC had first begun exploration in Chad in 2006.[8]

In 2019 CPC received approval from the Environmental Protection Administration to construct a LNG terminal in Taichung.[10]

Suppliers[edit]

CPC Corporation was a historic buyer of Iranian oil and received a sanctions waiver from the United States when they imposed sanctions on Iranian oil imports.[11] Despite receiving a sanctions waiver CPC Corporation chose to end its use of Iran as a source country.[12]"
"In 2018 CPC signed an agreement with American Cheniere Energy to purchase liquefied natural gas for 25 years. Deliveries are set to begin in 2021.[13]
