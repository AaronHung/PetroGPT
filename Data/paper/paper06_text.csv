This book complements the book Handbook of Petroleum Analysis (J.G.
Speight, John Wiley & Sons, 2001), and it is the purpose of these books to
make available, in two handy volumes the essential elements of all analyt-
ical tests used to characterize petroleum and petroleum products.
It is, of course, critical for testing laboratory personnel to be fully familiar
with all the details of the tests they are performing. But it is also important
for nonlaboratory personnel to know at least the signiﬁcance, advantages,
and limitations of particular tests used to characterize product quality. Both
the suppliers and the customers need to agree on the appropriate product
quality speciﬁcations, and this can be achieved by understanding the intri-
cacies of the respective test methods.
Product speciﬁcations not based on realistic testing capabilities can only
lead to quality complaints and unhappiness on the part of both suppliers
and customers. Therefore, we expect that this book will prove useful not
only to laboratory personnel but also to product speciﬁcation writers,
process engineers, process scientists, researchers, and marketing staff in
understanding the importance of these tests as well as their limitations, so
that sound conclusions can be reached regarding the quality and perfor-
mance of a particular product.
Organizations such as the American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) in the United States, the Institute of Petroleum (IP , London, U.K.),
the Association Française de Normalisation (AFNOR, Paris, France),
the Deutsche Institut für Normung (DIN, Germany), the Japan Industrial
Standards (JIS, Tokyo, Japan), and the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO, Geneva, Switzerland) have made signiﬁcant contri-
butions in developing standard test methods for the analyses of petroleum
products. Although it is not possible to include all of the test methods of
these organizations, cross-reference is made of the standard methods of
analysis of the ASTM to those that are known for the IP .
In addition, the ASTM has discontinued several of the tests cited in the
text for testing and materials, but they are included here because of their
continued use by analytical laboratories. Several tests may even have been
modiﬁed for internal company use, and there is no way of authenticating
such use. Indeed, many tests should be adopted for internal company use
xvinstead of existing in-house testing protocols. For example, one might read
in the published literature of the use of modiﬁed naphtha to precipitate an
asphaltene fraction. Such a statement is meaningless without precise deﬁ-
nition of the chemical composition of the modiﬁed naphtha. Naphtha is"
"a complex petroleum product that can vary depending on the method of
production. So, without any qualiﬁcation or chemical description of the
modiﬁed naphtha, a comparison of the precipitate with a pentane-asphaltene
or heptane-asphaltene will be futile. Indeed, cross-comparisons within the
in-house laboratories may be difﬁcult if not impossible. The moral of this
tale is that testing protocols should be standardized!
It is not intented that this book should replace the Annual Book of ASTM
Standards . This book is intended to be a complementary volume that con-
tains explanations of the raison d’être of the various test methods.
Each chapter is written as a stand-alone unit, which has necessitated some
repetition. This repetition is considered necessary for the reader to have 
all of the relevant information at hand, especially where there are tests 
that can be applied to several products. Where this is not possible, cross-
references to the pertinent chapter(s) are included. Several general refer-
ences are listed for the reader to consult for a more detailed description 
of petroleum products. No attempt has been made to be exhaustive in the
citations of such works. Thereafter, the focus is to cite the relevant test
methods that are applied to petroleum products.
Finally, in this book, no preference is given to any particular tests.All lists
of tests are alphabetical.

PETROLEUM ANAL YSIS
1.1. INTRODUCTION
Petroleum , meaning literally “rock oil,” is the term used to describe a myriad
of hydrocarbon-rich ﬂuids that have accumulated in subterranean reser-
voirs. Petroleum (also called crude oil ) varies dramatically in color, odor,
and ﬂow properties that reﬂect the diversity of its origin (Table 1.1).
Petroleum products are any petroleum-based products that can be
obtained by reﬁning (Chapter 2) and comprise reﬁnery gas, ethane, lique-
ﬁed petroleum gas (LPG), naphtha, gasoline, aviation fuel, marine fuel,
kerosene, diesel fuel, distillate fuel oil, residual fuel oil, gas oil, lubricants,
white oil, grease, wax, asphalt, as well as coke. Petrochemical products
(Speight, 1999a) are not included here.
Petroleum products are highly complex chemicals, and considerable
effort is required to characterize their chemical and physical properties with
a high degree of precision and accuracy. Indeed, the analysis of petroleum
products is necessary to determine the properties that can assist in resolv-
ing a process problem as well as the properties that indicate the function
and performance of the product in service.
Crude petroleum and the products obtained therefrom contain a variety"
"of compounds, usually but not always hydrocarbons. As the number of
carbon atoms in, for example, the parafﬁn series increases, the complexity
of petroleum mixtures also rapidly increases. Consequently, detailed analy-
sis of the individual constituents of the higher boiling fractions becomes
increasingly difﬁcult, if not impossible.
Additionally, classes (or types ) of hydrocarbons were, and still are, deter-
mined based on the capability to isolate them by separation techniques.The
four fractional types into which petroleum is subdivided are parafﬁns,
oleﬁns, naphthenes, and aromatics (PONA). Parafﬁnic hydrocarbons
include both normal and branched alkanes, whereas oleﬁns refer to normal
and branched alkenes that contain one or more double or triple carbon-
carbon bonds. Naphthene (not to be confused with naphthalene ) is a term
speciﬁc to the petroleum industry that refers to the saturated cyclic hydro-
carbons (cycloalkanes ). Finally, the term aromatics includes all hydrocar-
bons containing one or more rings of the benzenoid structure.
1These general deﬁnitions of the different fractions are subject to the
many combinations of the hydrocarbon types (Speight, 1999a; Speight,
2001) and the action of the adsorbent or the solvent used in the separation
procedure. For example, a compound containing one benzenoid ring (six
aromatic carbon atoms) that has 12 nonaromatic carbons in alkyl side
chains can be separated as an aromatic compound depending on the adsor-
bent employed.
Although not directly derived from composition, the terms light and
heavy or sweet and sour provide convenient terms for use in descriptions.
For example, light petroleum (often referred to as conventional petroleum )
is usually rich in low-boiling constituents and waxy molecules whereas
heavy petroleum contains greater proportions of higher-boiling, more 
aromatic, and heteroatom-containing (N-, O-, S-, and metal containing) 
constituents. Heavy oil is more viscous than conventional petroleum and
requires enhanced methods for recovery. Bitumen is near solid or solid and
cannot be recovered by enhanced oil recovery methods.
Conventional (light) petroleum is composed of hydrocarbons together
with smaller amounts of organic compounds of nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur
and still smaller amounts of compounds containing metallic constituents,
particularly vanadium, nickel, iron, and copper. The processes by which
petroleum was formed dictate that petroleum composition will vary and be
site speciﬁc , thus leading to a wide variety of compositional differences. The
term site speciﬁc is intended to convey that petroleum composition will be
dependent on regional and local variations in the proportion of the various
precursors that went into the formation of the protopetroleum as well as2 petroleum analysis

Thus the purely hydrocarbon content may be higher than 90% by weight
for parafﬁnic petroleum and 50% by weight for heavy crude oil and much
lower for tar sand bitumen. The nonhydrocarbon constituents are usually
concentrated in the higher-boiling portions of the crude oil.The carbon and
hydrogen content is approximately constant from crude oil to crude oil even
though the amounts of the various hydrocarbon types and of the individ-
ual isomers may vary widely. Thus the carbon content of various types of
petroleum is usually between 83% and 87% by weight and the hydrogen
content is in the range of 11–14% by weight.
General aspects of petroleum quality (as a reﬁnery feedstock) are
assessed by measurement of physical properties such as relative density
(speciﬁc gravity), refractive index, or viscosity, or by empirical tests such as
pour point or oxidation stability that are intended to relate to behavior in
service. In some cases the evaluation may include tests in mechanical rigs
and engines either in the laboratory or under actual operating conditions.
Measurements of bulk properties are generally easy to perform and,
therefore, quick and economical. Several properties may correlate well with
certain compositional characteristics and are widely used as a quick and
inexpensive means to determine those characteristics. The most important
properties of a whole crude oil are its boiling-point distribution, its density
(or API gravity), and its viscosity. The boiling-point distribution ,boiling
proﬁle , or distillation assay gives the yield of the various distillation cuts,"
"and selected properties of the fractions are usually determined (Table 1.2).
It is a prime property in its own right that indicates how much gasoline and
other transportation fuels can be made from petroleum without conversion.
Density and viscosity are measured for secondary reasons.The former helps
to estimate the parafﬁnic character of the oil, and the latter permits the
assessment of its undesirable residual material that causes resistance to
ﬂow. Boiling-point distribution, density, and viscosity are easily measured
and give a quick ﬁrst evaluation of petroleum oil. Sulfur content, another
crucial and primary property of a crude oil, is also readily determined.
Certain composite characterization values, calculated from density and
mid-boiling point, correlate better with molecular composition than density
alone (Speight, 2001).
The acceptance of heavy oil and bitumen as reﬁnery feedstocks has
meant that the analytical techniques used for the lighter feedstocks have
had to evolve to produce meaningful data that can be employed to assist
in deﬁning reﬁnery scenarios for processing the feedstocks. In addition,
selection of the most appropriate analytical procedures will aid in the pre-
dictability of feedstock behavior during reﬁning. This same rationale can
also be applied to feedstock behavior during recovery operations. Indeed,introduction 34 petroleum analysisTable 1.2. Distillation Proﬁle of Petroleum (Leduc, Woodbend, Upper Devonian, Alberta, Canada)

(Speight and Moschopedis, 1979; Speight, 1990, Speight, 1999a, Speight,
2001) that many of the test methods designed for petroleum may need 
modiﬁcation (Wallace, 1988).
Thus knowledge of the composition of petroleum allows the reﬁner 
to optimize the conversion of raw petroleum into high-value products.
Petroleum is now the world’s main source of energy and petrochemical
feedstock. Originally, petroleum was distilled and sold as fractions with
desirable physical properties. Today crude oil is sold in the form of gaso-
line, solvents, diesel and jet fuel, heating oil, lubricant oils, and asphalts, or
it is converted to petrochemical feedstocks such as ethylene, propylene, the
butenes, butadiene, and isoprene. These feedstocks are important, because
they form the basis for, among others, the plastics, elastomer, and artiﬁcial
ﬁber industries. Modern reﬁning uses a sophisticated combination of heat,
catalyst, and hydrogen to rearrange the petroleum molecules into these
products. Conversion processes include coking, hydrocracking, and catalytic
cracking to break large molecules into smaller fractions; hydrotreating to
reduce heteroatoms and aromatics, creating environmentally acceptable
products; and isomerization and reforming to rearrange molecules into
those with high value, e.g., gasoline with a high octane number.
Also, knowledge of the molecular composition of petroleum allows the
environmentalist to consider the biological impact of environmental expo-
sure. Increasingly, petroleum is being produced and transported from
remote areas of the world to reﬁneries located closer to their markets.
Although a minuscule fraction of that oil is released into the environment,
because of the sheer volume involved there is the potential for environ-
mental exposure. Molecular composition is needed not only to identify the
sources of contamination but also to understand the fate and effects of its
potentially hazardous components.
In addition, knowledge of the composition of petroleum allows the 
geochemist to answer questions of precursor-product relationships and con-
version mechanisms. Biomarkers, molecules that retain the basic carbon
skeletons of biological compounds from living organisms after losing func-
tional groups through the maturation process, play an important role in such
studies. The distribution of biomarker isomers can not only serve as ﬁn-
gerprints for oil/oil and oil/source correlation (to relate the source and
reservoir) but also give geochemical information on organic source input"
"(marine, lacustrine, or land-based sources), age, maturity, depositional envi-
ronment (for example, clay or carbonate, oxygen levels, salinity), and alter-
ation (for example, water washing, biodegradation).
The need for the application of analytical techniques has increased over
the past three decades because of the change in feedstock composition.This
has arisen because of the increased amounts of the heavier feedstocks thatintroduction 5are now used to produce liquid products. Before the energy crises of the
1970s, the heavier feedstocks were used infrequently as sources of liquid
fuels and were used to produce asphalt. Now these feedstocks have
increased in value as sources of liquid fuels.
Because of the wide range of chemical and physical properties, a wide
range of tests have been (and continue to be) developed to provide an indi-
cation of the means by which a particular feedstock should be processed.
Initial inspection of the nature of the petroleum will provide deductions
about the most logical means of reﬁning or correlation of various proper-
ties to structural types present and hence attempted classiﬁcation of the
petroleum. Proper interpretation of the data resulting from the inspection
of crude oil requires an understanding of their signiﬁcance.
Having decided what characteristics are necessary, it then remains to
describe the product in terms of a speciﬁcation. This entails selecting suit-
able test methods and setting appropriate limits. Many speciﬁcations in
widespread use have evolved usually by the addition of extra clauses (rarely
is a clause deleted). This has resulted in unnecessary restrictions that, in
turn, result in increased cost of the products speciﬁed.
1.2. DEFINITIONS
Terminology is the means by which various subjects are named so that 
reference can be made in conversations and in writing so that the meaning
is passed on.
Deﬁnitions are the means by which scientists and engineers communi-
cate the nature of a material to each other and to the world, through either
the spoken or the written word. Thus the deﬁnition of a material can be
extremely important and can have a profound inﬂuence on how the tech-
nical community and the public perceive that material.
Historically, physical properties such as boiling point, density (gravity),
odor, and viscosity have been used to describe oils. Petroleum may be called
light or heavy in reference to the amount of low-boiling constituents and
the relative density (speciﬁc gravity). Likewise, odor is used to distinguish
between sweet (low sulfur) and sour (high sulfur) crude oil. Viscosity indi-
cates the ease of (or more correctly the resistance to) ﬂow.
However, where there is the need for a thorough understanding of petro-
leum and the associated technologies, it is essential that the deﬁnitions and
the terminology of petroleum science and technology be given prime con-
sideration (Speight, 1999a). This presents a better understanding of petro-
leum, its constituents, and its various fractions. Of the many forms of
terminology that have been used not all have survived, but the more com-6 petroleum analysismonly used are illustrated here. Particularly troublesome, and more 
confusing, are those terms that are applied to the more viscous materials,
for example, the use of the terms bitumen and asphalt . This part of the 
text attempts to alleviate much of the confusion that exists, but it must 
be remembered that the terminology of petroleum is still open to personal
choice and historical usage.
Petroleum is a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbons, generally in
a liquid state, which may also include compounds of sulfur, nitrogen,
oxygen, metals, and other elements (ASTM D-4175, 1998; Speight, 1999a,
1999b and references cited therein).
In the crude state petroleum has minimal value, but when reﬁned it pro-
vides high-value liquid fuels, solvents, lubricants, and many other products
(Purdy, 1957). The fuels derived from petroleum contribute approximately
one-third to one-half of the total world energy supply and are used not only
for transportation fuels (i.e., gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel, among
others) but also to heat buildings. Petroleum products have a wide variety
of uses that vary from gaseous and liquid fuels to near-solid machinery
lubricants. In addition, the residue of many reﬁnery processes, asphalt—a
once-maligned by-product—is now a premium value product for highway
surfaces, rooﬁng materials, and miscellaneous waterprooﬁng uses.
Crude petroleum is a mixture of compounds boiling at different tem-
peratures that can be separated into a variety of different generic fractions
by distillation (Speight, 1999a, Speight, 2001). The terminology of these 
fractions has been bound by utility and often bears little relationship to
composition.
The molecular boundaries of petroleum cover a wide range of boiling
points and carbon numbers of hydrocarbon compounds and other com-"
"pounds containing nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, as well as metallic (por-
phyrin) constituents. However, the actual boundaries of such a petroleum
map can only be arbitrarily deﬁned in terms of boiling point and carbon
number (Fig. 1.1). In fact, petroleum is so diverse that materials from dif-
ferent sources exhibit different boundary limits, and for this reason alone
it is not surprising that petroleum has been difﬁcult to map in a precise
manner (Speight, 2001).
Because there is a wide variation in the properties of crude petroleum,
the proportions in which the different constituents occur vary with origin
(Gruse and Stevens, 1960; Speight, 1999a).Thus some crude oils have higher
proportions of the lower-boiling components and others (such as heavy 
oil and bitumen) have higher proportions of higher-boiling components
(asphaltic components and residuum).
There are several other deﬁnitions that also must be included in any text
on petroleum analysis, in particular because this text also focuses on thedeﬁnitions 7analysis of heavy oil and bitumen. These deﬁnitions are included because
of the increased reliance on the development of these resources and the
appearance of the materials in reﬁneries.
Heavy oil (heavy crude oil) is more viscous than conventional crude oil
and has a lower mobility in the reservoir but can be recovered through a
well from the reservoir by the application of secondary or enhanced recov-
ery methods. On the other hand, tar sand includes the several rock types
that contain an extremely viscous hydrocarbonaceous material that is not
recoverable in its natural state by conventional oil well production methods
including currently used enhanced recovery techniques.
More descriptively, tar sand is an unconsolidated-to-consolidated sand-
stone or a porous carbonate rock, impregnated with bitumen. In simple
terms, an unconsolidated rock approximates the consistency of dry or moist
sand, and a consolidated rock may approximate the consistency of set con-
crete. Alternative names, such as bituminous sand or (in Canada) oil sand ,
are gradually ﬁnding usage, with the former name more technically correct.
The term oil sand is also used in the same way as the term tar sand , and the
terms are used interchangeably. The term oil sand is analogous to the term
oil shale . Neither material contains oil, but oil is produced therefrom by
application of thermal decomposition methods. It is important to under-
stand that tar sand and the bitumen contained therein are different com-
ponents of the deposit. The recovery of the bitumen, a hydrocarbonaceous
material that can be converted into synthetic crude oil (Speight, 1990,8 petroleum analysis
Figure 1.1. Boiling point-carbon number proﬁle for petroleumSpeight, 1999a), depends to a large degree on the composition and con-
struction of the sands.
It should be noted here that to be chemically correct , it must be recog-
nized that hydrocarbon molecules only contain carbon atoms and hydro-
gen atoms. The molecular constituents found in tar sand bitumen also
contain nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and metals (particularly nickel and vana-
dium) chemically bound in their molecular structures. Thus it is chemically
correct to refer to bitumen as a hydrocarbonaceous material, that is, a mate-
rial that is composed predominantly of carbon and hydrogen, while recog-
nizing the presence of the other atoms.
The term bitumen (also, on occasion, referred to as native asphalt and
extra heavy oil ) includes a wide variety of reddish-brown to black materi-
als of semisolid, viscous to brittle character that can exist in nature with no
mineral impurity or with mineral matter contents that exceed 50% by
weight. Bitumen is frequently found ﬁlling pores and crevices of sandstone,
limestone, or argillaceous sediments, in which case the organic and associ-
ated mineral matrix is known as rock asphalt .
On the basis of the deﬁnition of tar sand (above), bitumen is a naturally
occurring hydrocarbonaceous material that has little or no mobility under
reservoir conditions and which cannot be recovered through a well by con-
ventional oil well production methods including currently used enhanced
recovery techniques; current methods for bitumen recovery involve mining
(Speight, 1990).
Because of the immobility of the bitumen, the permeability of the
deposit is low and passage of ﬂuids through the deposit is prevented.
Bitumen is a high-boiling material with little, if any, material boiling below
350°C (660°F), and the boiling range approximates the boiling range of
an atmospheric residuum and has a much lower proportion of volatile
constituents than a conventional crude oil (Speight, 1999a, Speight,
2001).
Synthetic crude oil is the hydrocarbon liquid that is produced from
bitumen , by a variety of processes that involve thermal decomposition.
Synthetic crude oil (also referred to as syncrude ) is a marketable and trans-"
"portable product that resembles conventional crude oil. Synthetic crude oil ,
although it may be produced from one of the less conventional fossil fuel
sources, can be accepted into and reﬁned by the usual reﬁnery system.
For the purposes of terminology, it is preferable to subdivide petroleum
and related materials into three major subgroups (Table 1.3; Speight, 1999a):
1. Materials that are of natural origin;
2. Materials that are manufactured; and
3. Materials that are integral fractions derived from the natural or 
manufactured products.deﬁnitions 9The natural materials occur in different locations throughout the Earth.The
derived and manufactured materials are obtained by using methods differ-
ent from those used to obtain the natural materials.
1.3. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES
Petroleum is perhaps the most important substance consumed in modern
society. It provides not only raw materials for the ubiquitous plastics and
other products but also fuel for energy, industry, heating, and trans-
portation. The word petroleum , derived from the Latin petra and oleum ,
means literally “rock oil” and refers to hydrocarbons that occur widely
in the sedimentary rocks in the form of gases, liquids, semisolids, or 
solids.
The history of any subject is the means by which the subject is studied
in the hope that much can be learned from the events of the past. In the
current context, the occurrence and use of petroleum, petroleum deriva-
tives (naphtha), heavy oil, and bitumen is not new. The use of petroleum
and its derivatives was practiced in pre-common era times and is known
largely through historical use in many of the older civilizations (Henry,
1873; Abraham, 1945; Forbes, 1958a, 1958b, 1959, 1964; James and Thorpe,
1994). Thus the use of petroleum and the development of related technol-
ogy is not such a modern subject as we are inclined to believe. The petro-
leum industry is essentially a twentieth-century industry, but to understand
the evolution of the industry, it is essential to have a brief understanding of
the ﬁrst uses of petroleum.10 petroleum analysis

* Bitumen from tar sand deposits. ** Products of petroleum processing. *** Products of coal

example, the Tigris–Euphrates valley, in what is now Iraq, was inhabited as
early as 4000 B.C. by the people known as the Sumerians, who established
one of the ﬁrst great cultures of the civilized world. The Sumerians devised
the cuneiform script, built the temple-towers known as ziggurats, and devel-
oped an impressive code of law, literature, and mythology. As the culture
developed, bitumen or asphalt was frequently used in construction and in
ornamental works.
Although it is possible to differentiate between the words bitumen and
asphalt in modern use (Speight, 1999a) the occurrence of these words in
older texts offers no such possibility. It is signiﬁcant that the early use of
bitumen was in the nature of cement for securing or joining together
various objects, and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive
of this application.
Early references to petroleum and its derivatives occur in the Bible,
although by the time the various books of the Bible were written, the use
of petroleum and bitumen was established. Investigations at archeological
sites have conﬁrmed the use of petroleum and bitumen in antiquity for con-
struction, mummiﬁcation, decorative jewelry, waterprooﬁng, as well as for
medicinal use (Speight, 1978, 1999a). Many other references to bitumen are
found throughout the Greek and Roman empires, and from that time 
to the Middle Ages early scientists (alchemists) frequently referred to 
the use of bitumen. In the late ﬁfteenth and early sixteenth centuries both
Christopher Columbus and Sir Walter Raleigh have been credited with the
discovery of the asphalt deposit on the island of Trinidad and apparently
used the material to caulk their ships. There was also an interest in the
thermal product of petroleum (nafta; naphtha) when it was discovered 
that this material could be used as an illuminant and as a supplement to
asphalt incendiaries in warfare.
To continue such references is beyond the scope of this book, although
they do give a ﬂavor of the developing interest in petroleum. However, it
is sufﬁcient to note that there are many other references to the occurrence
and use of bitumen or petroleum derivatives up to the beginning of the
modern petroleum industry. However, what is obvious by its absence is any
reference to the analysis of the bitumen that was used variously through"
"history. It can only be assumed that there was a correlation between the
bitumen character and its behavior.This would be the determining factor(s)
in its use as a sealant, as a binder, or as a medicine. In this sense, docu-
mented history has not been kind to the scientist and engineer.
Thus the history of analysis of petroleum and its products can only be
suggested to have started during the second half of the nineteenth century.
For example, in 1857 several aromatic hydrocarbons from Burma petro-
leum were identiﬁed by the formation of the barium salts of benzenesul-historical perspectives 11fonic acids followed by fractional crystallization. In addition, an analytical
distillation of petroleum was carried out in the early 1870s (Silliman, 1872).
Further developments of the analytical chemistry of petroleum continued
throughout the century (Mair, 1960).
It might be assumed that petroleum analysis evolved as analytical chem-
istry evolved. And it is correct to ascribe to analytical chemistry a position
of primary importance because only through chemical analysis can matter
(in this context, petroleum) in its variety of forms be dealt with logically.
1.4. MODERN PERSPECTIVES
The modern petroleum industry began in 1859 with the discovery and 
subsequent commercialization of petroleum in Pennsylvania (Bell, 1945).
During the 6,000 years of its use, the importance of petroleum has pro-
gressed from the relatively simple use of asphalt from Mesopotamian
seepage sites to the present-day reﬁning operations that yield a wide variety
of products and petrochemicals (Speight, 1999a). However, what is more
pertinent to the industry is that throughout the millennia in which petro-
leum has been known and used, it is only in the twentieth century that
attempts were made to formulate and standardize petroleum analysis.
As the twentieth century progressed, there was increased emphasis and
reliance on instrumental approaches to petroleum analysis. In particular,
spectroscopic methods have risen to a level of importance that is perhaps
the dream of those who ﬁrst applied such methodology to petroleum analy-
sis. Potentiometric titration methods also evolved, and the procedures have
found favor in the identiﬁcation of functional types in petroleum and its
fractions.
Spectrophotometers came into widespread use beginning around 1940,
and this led to wide application in petroleum analysis. Ultraviolet absorp-
tion spectroscopy ,infrared spectroscopy ,mass spectrometry ,emission spec-
troscopy , and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy continue to make
major contributions to petroleum analysis.
Chromatography is another method that is utilized for the most part in
the separation of complex mixtures. Ion exchange materials, long known in
the form of naturally occurring silicates, were used in the earliest types of
regenerative water softeners. Gas chromatography ,or vapor-phase chro-
matography , found ready applications in the identiﬁcation of the individual
constituents of petroleum. It is still extremely valuable in the analysis 
of hydrocarbon mixtures of high volatility and has become an important
analytical tool in the petroleum industry. With the development of high-
temperature columns the technique has been extended to mixtures of 
low volatility, such as gas oils and some residua.12 petroleum analysisThe foregoing section is included to introduce the reader to the histori-
cal aspects of petroleum analysis and to show the glimmerings of how it
evolved over the twentieth century. Indeed, despite the historical use of
petroleum and related materials, the petroleum industry is a modern indus-
try, having come into being in 1859. From these comparatively recent begin-
nings, petroleum analysis has arisen as a dedicated science.
1.5. ANAL YSIS AND SPECIFICATIONS
Petroleum exhibits wide variations in composition and properties, and these
occur not only in petroleum from different ﬁelds but also in oils taken from
different production depths in the same well. Historically, physical proper-
ties such as boiling point, density (gravity), and viscosity have been used to
describe petroleum, but the needs for analysis are even more extensive
(Table 1.4).analysis and speciﬁcations 13

material under investigation but, more appropriately, determining the suit-
ability of the petroleum for reﬁning or the product for use. In this sense,
the end product of petroleum analysis or (testing) is a series of data that
allow the investigator to specify the character and quality of the material
under investigation.Thus a series of speciﬁcations are determined for petro-
leum and its products.
Because of the differences in petroleum composition, the importance of
the correct sampling of crude oil that contains light hydrocarbons cannot
be overestimated. Properties such as speciﬁc gravity, distillation proﬁle,
vapor pressure, hydrogen sulﬁde content, and octane number of gasoline
are affected by the light hydrocarbon content so that suitable cooling or
pressure sampling methods must be used and care taken during the subse-
quent handling of the oil to avoid the loss of any volatile constituents. In
addition, adequate records of the circumstances and conditions during sam-
pling must be made. For example, sampling from oil ﬁeld separators, the
temperatures and pressures of the separation plant, and the atmospheric
temperature should be noted.
Hence, the production of data focuses on (1) measurement, 2) accuracy,
(3) precision, and (4) method validation, all of which depend on the 
sampling protocols that were used to obtain the sample. Without strict 
sampling protocols, variation and loss of accuracy (or precision) must be
anticipated. For example, correct sampling of the product in storage or
carrier tanks is important to obtain a representative sample for the 
laboratory tests that are essential in converting measured quantities to the
standard volume.
Elemental analyses of petroleum show that it contains mainly carbon
and hydrogen. Nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur (heteroelements) are present
in smaller amounts, and trace elements such as vanadium, nickel, etc, are
also present. Of the heteroelements, sulfur is the most important. The
mixture of hydrocarbons is highly complex. Parafﬁnic, naphthenic, and 
aromatic structures can occur in the same molecule, and the complexity
increases with boiling range. The attempted classiﬁcation of crude oils in
terms of these three main structural types has proved inadequate.
The value of a particular crude to a reﬁner depends on its quality and
whether he can economically obtain a satisfactory product pattern that
matches market demand ( market pull ). In the main, the reﬁner is not con-
cerned with the actual chemical nature of the material but in methods of
analysis that would provide information sufﬁcient to assess the potential
quality of the oil, to supply preliminary engineering data, and also to indi-
cate whether any difﬁculties might arise in handling, reﬁning, or transport-
ing petroleum or its products. Such information may be obtained in one of
two ways:14 petroleum analysis1. Preliminary assay-inspection data.
2. A full assay involving the preparation of a true boiling point curve
and the analysis of fractions and product blends throughout the full
range of the crude oil.
The preliminary assay provides general data on the oil and is based on
simple tests such as distillation range, water content, speciﬁc gravity, and
sulfur content that enable desirable or undesirable features to be noted.
This form of assay requires only a small quantity of sample and is there-
fore particularly useful for the characterization of oil ﬁeld samples pro-
duced from cores, drill stem tests, or seepages.
The tests in the preliminary assay are relatively simple and can be com-
pleted in a short time and generally on a routine basis. This assay gives a
useful general picture of the quality of petroleum, but it does not cover the
work necessary to provide adequate data, for example, for the design of
reﬁnery equipment, nor does it produce a sufﬁcient quantity of the various
products from the crude so that they can be examined for quality. A full
assay of petroleum is based on a true boiling point distillation of the crude,
and sufﬁcient data are obtained to assess the yields and properties of the
straight-run products, covering light hydrocarbons, light, middle, and heavy
distillate, lubricants, residual fuel oil, and residuum. Often, the middle
ground is reached between the preliminary assay and the full assay, but the
requirements may also be feedstock dependent (Table 1.4).
A feedstock speciﬁcation or product speciﬁcation provides the data that
give adequate control of feedstock behavior in a reﬁnery or product quality.
Thus a speciﬁcation offers the luxury of predictability of feedstock behav-
ior in a reﬁnery or predictability of product quality (therefore, product
behavior) relative to market demand. Ultimately, feedstock behavior and/or
product quality is judged by an assessment of performance. And it is per-"
"formance that is the ultimate criterion of quality. It is therefore necessary
to determine those properties, the values of which can be established pre-
cisely and relatively simply by inspection tests in a control laboratory, that
correlate closely with the important performance properties.
Sometimes the inspection tests attempt to measure these properties, for
example, the carbon residue of a feedstock that is an approximation of 
the amount of the thermal coke that will be formed during reﬁning or a
research octane number test devised to measure performance of motor fuel.
In other cases the behavior must be determined indirectly from a series of
test results.
In addition, there are many instances in which interrelationships of the
speciﬁcation data enable properties to be predicted from the measured
properties with as good precision as can be obtained by a single test. It
would be possible to examine in this way the relationships between all theanalysis and speciﬁcations 15speciﬁed properties of a product and to establish certain key properties
from which the remainder could be predicted, but this would be a tedious
task.
An alternative approach to that of picking out the essential tests in a
speciﬁcation by using regression analysis is to examine at the speciﬁcation
as a whole and to use the necessary component. This is termed principal
components analysis (see also p. 23). In this method a set of data as points
in multidimensional space ( n-dimensional , corresponding to n original tests)
is examined to determine the direction that accounts for the biggest vari-
ability in the data ( ﬁrst principal component ). The process is repeated until
n principal components are evaluated, but it must be determined which
components are of practical importance because some principal compo-
nents may be due to experimental error. The number of signiﬁcant princi-
pal components shows the number of independent properties being
measured by the tests considered.
The number of independent properties having been established, there
exists a natural basis for making the speciﬁcation more efﬁcient. In the long
term, it might be possible to obtain new tests of a fundamental nature to
replace existing tests. In the short term, selecting the best of the existing
tests to deﬁne product quality will be beneﬁcial.
Finally, the analytical methods used to describe petroleum must be mod-
iﬁed for the characterization of tar sand bitumen in the same way that tests
for conventional petroleum have been modiﬁed and/or replaced by newer,
more relevant test methods. For example, what might appear to be a test of
minimal value for conventional petroleum might afford invaluable data for
determining the behavior of tar sand bitumen or the potential products
from each.
In fact, it is because of behavior differences that research into text
methods for tar sand bitumen is continuing (Wallace, 1988; Speight, 1999a,
Speight, 1999b). Clearly, for maximum efﬁciency the tests that are speciﬁed
for any feedstock or product should be as independent of each other as pos-
sible. In fact, the efﬁciency of a speciﬁcation should be judged by the extent
to which the tests speciﬁed will:
1. Predict (control) feedstock behavior;
2. Predict (control) and product quality;
3. Measure independent properties;
4. Measure these properties with adequate precision; and 
5. Offer rapid response to reﬁnery and laboratory demands.
Petroleum analysis has been greatly augmented in recent years by appli-
cation of a wide variety of instrumental techniques to studies of the hydro-16 petroleum analysiscarbon composition of crude oils and their products (Speight, 1999a,
Speight, 2001). Before this, hydrocarbon type analyses (percent parafﬁns,
naphthenes, oleﬁns, and aromatics) were derived from correlations based
on physical data. The advent of instrumental techniques has led to two
major developments:
1. Individual component analysis;
2. An extension to, and more detailed subdivision of, the various 
compound types that occur in the higher-boiling ranges of petroleum
distillates.
Of these instrumental techniques, gas/liquid chromatography and mass
spectrometry are the most important in providing the hydrocarbon com-
position data in crude oil assay work. By gas chromatographic analysis, it 
is now possible to determine routinely the individual methane (CH 4) to
heptane (C 7H16) hydrocarbons and the individual aromatics that boil below
165°C (330°F) and also obtain a complete normal parafﬁn distribution up
to C 50. In addition, with a microcoulometric detector speciﬁc to sulfur, the
sulfur compound distribution can be obtained throughout the distillate
range. Gas chromatographic analysis can also be used to provide simulated
true boiling point (TBP) curves, and developments in preparative scale
gas/liquid chromatography have made possible the preparation of fractions
in quantities sufﬁcient not only for extensive spectrometric analyses but"
"also for the normal inspection type tests to be undertaken.
Mass spectrometry offers a very rapid method for obtaining hydrocar-
bon type analyses on a wide range of fractions up to and including heavy
gas oils. The information obtained on a routine basis subdivides the hydro-
carbons into the various groups. The technique can also be used in 
conjunction with separation procedures such as gas/liquid chromatography,
molecular distillation, thermal diffusion, or selective adsorption to provide
more detailed analyses where necessary, even on fractions in the lubricat-
ing oil range.
Thus petroleum analysis is a complex subject involving a variety of tech-
niques, some of which have been mentioned above. But no single technique
should supercede the other. Petroleum analysis is a complex discipline that
needs a multidimensional approach. And the explanation of the data that
are obtained requires adequate interpretation.
1.6. SAMPLING
The value of any product is judged by the characteristics of the sample as
determined by laboratory tests.The sample used for the test(s) must be rep-sampling 17resentative of the bulk material, or data will be produced that are not rep-
resentative of the material and will, to be blunt, be incorrect no matter how
accurate or precise the test method is. In addition, the type and cleanliness
of sample containers are important: If the container is contaminated or is
made of material that either reacts with the product or is a catalyst, the test
results may be wrong.
Thus the importance of the correct sampling of any product destined for
analysis should always be overemphasized. Incorrect sampling protocols
can lead to erroneous analytical data from which performance of the
product in service cannot be accurately deduced. For example, properties
such as speciﬁc gravity, distillation yield, vapor pressure, hydrogen sulﬁde
content, and octane number of the gasoline are affected by the content of
low-boiling hydrocarbons so that suitable cooling or pressure sampling
methods must be used and care must be taken during the subsequent han-
dling of the sample to avoid the loss of any volatile components. In addi-
tion, adequate records of the circumstances and conditions during sampling
must be made; for example, in sampling from storage tanks, the tempera-
tures and pressures of the separation plant and the atmospheric tempera-
ture would be noted.
At the other end of the volatility scale, products that contain, or are com-
posed of, high-molecular-weight parafﬁn hydrocarbons (wax) that are also
in a solid state may require judicious heating (to dissolve the wax) and agi-
tation (homogenization, to ensure thorough mixing) before sampling. If
room-temperature sampling is the modus operandi and product cooling
causes wax to precipitate, homogenization to ensure correct sampling is also
necessary.
Representative samples are prerequisite for the laboratory evaluation of
any type of product, and many precautions are required in obtaining and
handling representative samples (ASTM D-270, ASTM D-1265). The pre-
cautions depend on the sampling procedure, the characteristics (low-boiling
or high-boiling constituents) of the product being sampled, and the storage
tank, container, or tank carrier from which the sample is obtained. In addi-
tion, the sample container must be clean, and the type to be used depends
not only on the product but also on the data to be produced.
The basic objective of each procedure is to obtain a truly representative
sample or, more often, a composite of several samples that can be consid-
ered to be a representative sample. In some cases, because of the size of the
storage tank and the lack of suitable methods of agitation, several samples
are taken from large storage tanks in such a manner that the samples rep-
resent the properties of the bulk material from different locations in the
tank and thus the composite sample will be representative of the entire lot
being sampled. This procedure allows for differences in sample that might
result from the stratiﬁcation of the bulk material because of tank size or18 petroleum analysistemperature at the different levels of the storage tank. Solid samples
require a different protocol that might involve melting (liquefying) of 
the bulk material (assuming that thermal decomposition is not induced) 
followed by homogenization. On the other hand, the protocol used for coal
sampling (ASTM D-346, ASTM D-2013) might also be applied to sampling
of petroleum products, such as coke, that are solid and for which accurate
analysis is required before sale.
Once the sampling procedure is accomplished, the sample container
should be labeled immediately to indicate the product, time of sampling,
location of the sampling point, and any other information necessary for the
sample identiﬁcation. And, if the samples were taken from different levels
of the storage tank, the levels from which the samples were taken and the"
"amounts taken and mixed into the composite should be indicated on the
sample documentation.
Although the above text is focused on the acquisitions of samples from
storage tanks, sampling records for any procedure must be complete and
should include, but are not restricted to, information such as:
1. The precise (geographic or other) location (or site or reﬁnery or
process) from which the sample was obtained.
2. The identiﬁcation of the location (or site or reﬁnery or process) by
name.
3. The character of the bulk material (solid, liquid, or gas) at the time
of sampling.
4. The means by which the sample was obtained.
5. The protocols that were used to obtain the sample.
6. The date and the amount of sample that was originally placed into
storage.
7. Any chemical analyses (elemental analyses, fractionation by adsor-
bents or by liquids, functional type analyses) that have been deter-
mined to date.
8. Any physical analyses (API gravity, viscosity, distillation proﬁle) that
have been determined to date.
9. The date of any such analyses included in items 5 and 6.
10. The methods used for analyses that were employed in items 5 and
6.
11. The analysts who carried out the work in items 5 and 6.
12. A log sheet showing the names of the persons (with the date and the
reason for the removal of an aliquot) who removed the samples from
storage and the amount of each sample (aliquot) that was removed
for testing.sampling 19In summary, there must be a means of identifying the sample history as
carefully as possible so that each sample is tracked and deﬁned in terms of
source and activity.
Thus the accuracy of the data from any subsequent procedures and 
tests for which the sample is used will be placed beyond a reasonable 
doubt .
1.7. MEASUREMENT
The issues that face petroleum analysts include the need to provide higher-
quality results. In addition, environmental regulations may inﬂuence the
method of choice. Nevertheless, the method of choice still depends to a
large extent on the boiling range (or carbon number) of the sample to be
analyzed. For example, there is a large variation in the carbon number range
and boiling points (of normal parafﬁns) for some of the more common
petroleum products and thus a variation in the methods that may be applied
to these products (Speight, 2001).
The predominant methods of measuring the properties of petroleum
products are covered by approximately seven test methods that are used in
the determination of bulk quantities of liquid petroleum and its products
(ASTM D-96,ASTM D-287,ASTM D-1085,ASTM D-1086,ASTM D-1087,
ASTM D-1250, ASTM D-1298).
Testing for suspended water and sediment (ASTM D-96) is used pri-
marily with fuel oils, where appreciable amounts of water and sediment may
cause fouling of facilities for handling the oil and give trouble in burner
mechanisms. Three standard methods are available for this determination.
The centrifuge method gives the total water and sediment content of the
sample by volume, the distillation method gives the water only, volumetri-
cally, and the extraction method gives the solid sediment in percentage by
weight.
The determination of density of speciﬁc gravity (ASTM D-287, ASTM
D-1298) in the measurement and calculation of volume of petroleum prod-
ucts is important because gravity is an index of the weight of a measured
volume of the product. Two scales are in use in the petroleum industry, spe-
ciﬁc gravity and API gravity, the determination being made in each case by
means of a hydrometer of constant weight displacing a variable volume of
oil. The reading obtained depends on both the gravity and the temperature
of the oil.
Gauging petroleum products (ASTM D-1085, discontinued in 1996 but
still in use) involves the use of procedures for determining the liquid con-
tents of tanks, ships and barges, tank cars, and tank trucks. Depth of liquid
is determined by gauging through speciﬁed hatches or by reading gauge20 petroleum analysisglasses or other devices. There are two basic types of gauges, innage and
outage. The procedures used depend on the type of tank to be gauged, its
equipment, and the gauging apparatus.
An innage gauge is the depth of liquid in a tank measured from the
surface of the liquid to the tank bottom or to a datum plate attached to the
shell or bottom. The innage gauge is used directly with the tank calibration
table and the temperature of the product to calculate the volume of the
product (ASTM D-1250). On the other hand, an outage gauge is the dis-
tance between the surface of the product in the tank and the reference point
above the surface, which is usually located in the gauging hatch. The outage
gauge is used either directly or indirectly with the tank calibration table and
the temperature of the product to calculate the volume of product. The
amount of any free water and sediment in the bottom of the tank is also
gauged so that corrections can be made when calculating the net volume"
"of the crude oil or petroleum product.
The liquid levels of products that have a Reid vapor pressure of 40 lb or
more are generally determined by the use of gauge glasses, rotary or slip-
tube gauges, tapes and bobs through pressure locks, or other types of
gauging equipment.The type of gauging equipment depends on the size and
type of the pressure tank.
There are also procedures for determining the temperatures of petro-
leum and its products when in a liquid state. Temperatures are determined
at speciﬁed locations in tanks, ships and barges, tank cars, and tank trucks.
For a nonpressure tank, a temperature is obtained by lowering a tank ther-
mometer of proper range through the gauging hatch to the speciﬁed liquid
level.After the entire thermometer assembly has had time to attain the tem-
perature of the product, the thermometer is withdrawn and read quickly.
This procedure is also used for low-pressure tanks equipped with gauging
hatches or standpipes and for any pressure tank that has a pressure lock.
For tanks equipped with thermometer wells, temperatures are obtained by
reading thermometers placed in the wells with their bulbs at the desired
tank levels. If more than one temperature is determined, the average 
temperature of the product is calculated from the observed temperatures.
Electrical-resistance thermometers are sometimes used to determine both
average and spot temperatures.
In general, the volume received or delivered is calculated from the
observed gauge readings. Corrections are made for any free water and sed-
iment as determined by the gauge of the water level in the tank. The result-
ant volume is then corrected to the equivalent volume at 15.6°C (60°F) by
use of the observed average temperature and the appropriate volume cor-
rection table (ASTM D-1250).When necessary, a further correction is made
for any suspended water and sediment that may be present in materials
such as crude petroleum and heavy fuel oils.measurement 21For the measurement of other petroleum products, a wide variety of tests
is available. In fact, approximately three hundred and ﬁfty tests (ASTM,
2000) are used to determine the different properties of petroleum products.
Each test has its own limits of accuracy and precision that must be adhered
to if the data are to be accepted.
1.8. ACCURACY
The accuracy of a test is a measure of how close the test result will be to
the true value of the property being measured. As such, the accuracy 
can be expressed as the bias between the test result and the true value.
However, the absolute accuracy can only be established if the true value is
known.
In the simplest sense, a convenient method to determine a relationship
between two measured properties is to plot one against the other (Fig. 1.2).
Such an exercise will provide either a line ﬁt of the points or a spread that
may or may not be within the limits of experimental error. The data can
then be used to determine the approximate accuracy of one or more points
employed in the plot. For example, a point that lies outside the limits of
experimental error (a ﬂyer ) will indicate an issue of accuracy with that test
and the need for a repeat determination.22 petroleum analysis
Figure 1.2. Illustration of the general relationship of petroleum propertiesHowever, the graphical approach is not appropriate for ﬁnding the
absolute accuracy between more than two properties. The well-established
statistical technique of regression analysis is more pertinent to determining
the accuracy of points derived from one property and any number of other
properties. There are many instances in which relationships of this sort
enable properties to be predicted from other measured properties with as
good precision as they can be measured by a single test. It would be possi-
ble to examine in this way the relationships between all the speciﬁed prop-
erties of a product and to establish certain key properties from which the
remainder could be predicted, but this would be a tedious task.
An alternative approach to that of picking out the essential tests in a
speciﬁcation using regression analysis is to take a look at the speciﬁcation
as a whole and extract the essential features (termed principal components
analysis ).
Principal components analysis (see also p. 16) involves an examination
of set of data as points in n-dimensional space (corresponding to noriginal
tests) and determines (ﬁrst) the direction that accounts for the biggest vari-
ability in the data ( ﬁrst principal component ). The process is repeated until
nprincipal components are evaluated, but not all of these are of practical
importance because some may be attributable purely to experimental error.
The number of signiﬁcant principal components shows the number of inde-
pendent properties being measured by the tests considered.
Following from this, it is necessary to establish the number of inde-
pendent properties that are necessary to predict product performance in"
"service with the goals of rendering any speciﬁcation more meaningful and
allowing a high degree of predictability of product behavior. For a long-
term approach it might be possible to obtain new tests of a fundamental
nature to replace, or certainly to supplement, existing tests. In the short
term, selecting the best of the existing tests to deﬁne product quality is the
most beneﬁcial route to predictability.
1.9. PRECISION
The precision of a test method is the variability between test results
obtained on the same material using the speciﬁc test method. The precision
of a test is usually unrelated to its accuracy. The results may be precise but
not necessarily accurate. In fact, the precision of an analytical method is the
amount of scatter in the results obtained from multiple analyses of a homo-
geneous sample. To be meaningful, the precision study must be performed
using the exact sample and standard preparation procedures that will 
be used in the ﬁnal method. Precision is expressed as repeatability and
reproducibility .precision 23The intralaboratory precision or within-laboratory precision refers to the
precision of a test method when the results are obtained by the same op-
erator in the same laboratory using the same apparatus. In some cases, the
precision is applied to data gathered by a different operator in the same
laboratory using the same apparatus. Thus intralaboratory precision has an
expanded meaning insofar as it can be applied to laboratory precision.
Repeatability or repeatability interval of a test ( r) is the maximum 
permissible difference due to test error between two results obtained on
the same material in the same laboratory.
r =2.77 ¥standard deviation of test
The repeatability interval r is, statistically, the 95% probability level, that is,
the differences between two test results are unlikely to exceed this repeata-
bility interval more than ﬁve times in a hundred.
The interlaboratory precision or between-laboratory precision is deﬁned
in terms of the variability between test results obtained on the aliquots of
the same homogeneous material in different laboratories using the same
test method.
The term reproducibility or reproducibility interval (R) is analogous 
to the term repeatability, but it is the maximum permissible difference
between two results obtained on the same material but now in different
laboratories. Therefore, differences between two or more laboratories
should not exceed the reproducibility interval more than ﬁve times in a
hundred.
R=2.77 ¥standard deviation of test
The repeatability value and the reproducibility value have important
implications for quality. As the demand for clear product speciﬁcations, and
hence control over product consistency grows, it is meaningless to establish
product speciﬁcations that are more restrictive than the reproducibility/
repeatability values of the speciﬁcation test methods.
1.10. METHOD VALIDATION
Method validation is the process of proving that an analytical method is
acceptable for its intended purpose. Many organizations, such as the ASTM,
provide a framework for performing such validations. In general, methods
for product speciﬁcations and regulatory submission must include studies
on speciﬁcity, linearity, accuracy, precision, range, detection limit, and quan-
titation limit.24 petroleum analysisThe process of method development and validation covers all aspects of
the analytical procedure, and the best way to minimize method problems is
to perform validation experiments during development.
In performing validation studies, the approach should be viewed with the
understanding that validation requirements are continually changing and
vary widely depending on the type of product under tested and compliance
with any necessary regulatory group.
In the early stages of new product development, it may not be necessary
to perform all of the various validation studies. However, the process of 
validating a method cannot be separated from the actual development of
the method conditions, because the developer will not know whether the
method conditions are acceptable until validation studies are performed.
The development and validation of a new analytical method may therefore
be an iterative process. Results of validation studies may indicate that a
change in the procedure is necessary, which may then require revalidation.
During each validation study, key method parameters are determined and
then used for all subsequent validation steps.
The ﬁrst step in the method development and validation cycle should
be to set minimum requirements, which are essentially acceptance speciﬁ-
cations for the method. A complete list of criteria should be agreed on
during method development with the end users before the method is devel-
oped so that expectations are clear. Once the validation studies are com-
plete, the method developers should be conﬁdent in the ability of the"
"method to provide good quantitation in their own laboratories. The
remaining studies should provide greater assurance that the method will
work well in other laboratories, where different operators, instruments, and
reagents are involved and where it will be used over much longer periods
of time.
The remaining precision studies comprise much of what is often referred
to as ruggedness .Intermediate precision is the precision obtained when an
assay is performed by multiple analysts using several instruments on dif-
ferent days in one laboratory. Intermediate precision results are used to
identify which of the above factors contribute signiﬁcant variability to the
ﬁnal result.
The last type of precision study is reproducibility (q.v.), which is deter-
mined by testing homogeneous samples in multiple laboratories, often as
part of interlaboratory crossover studies. The evaluation of reproducibility
results often focuses more on measuring bias in results than on determin-
ing differences in precision alone. Statistical equivalence is often used as a
measure of acceptable interlaboratory results. An alternative, more practi-
cal approach is the use of analytical equivalence , in which a range of accept-
able results is chosen before the study and used to judge the acceptability
of the results obtained from the different laboratories.method validation 25Performing a thorough method validation can be a tedious process, but
the quality of data generated with the method is directly linked to the
quality of this process. Time constraints often do not allow for sufﬁcient
method validation. Many researchers have experienced the consequences
of invalid methods and realized that the amount of time and resources
required to solve problems discovered later exceeds what would have been
expended initially if the validation studies had been performed properly.
Putting in time and effort up front will help any analyst to ﬁnd a way through
the method validation maze and will eliminate many of the problems
common to inadequately validated analytical methods.

PETROLEUM AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS
2.1. PETROLEUM
Petroleum is a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbons, generally in a
liquid state, that may also include compounds of sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen,
metals, and other elements (ASTM D-4175). Consequently, it is not sur-
prising that petroleum can vary in composition properties and produce wide"
"variations in reﬁning behavior as well as product properties.
Petroleum being processed in reﬁneries is becoming increasingly heavier
(higher amounts of residuum) and higher sulfur content) (Speight, 1999,
and references cited therein). Market demand ( market pull ) dictates that
residua must be upgraded to higher-value products (Speight and Ozum,
2002). In short, the value of petroleum depends on its quality for reﬁning
and whether or not a product slate can be obtained to ﬁt market demand.
Thus process units in a reﬁnery require analytical test methods that can
adequately evaluate feedstocks and monitor product quality. In addition,
the high sulfur content of petroleum and regulations limiting the maximum
sulfur content of fuels makes sulfur removal a priority in reﬁnery process-
ing. Here again, analytical methodology is key to the successful determina-
tion of the sulfur compound types present and their subsequent removal.
Upgrading residua involves processing (usually conversion) into a more
salable, higher-valued product. Improved characterization methods are 
necessary for process design, crude oil evaluation, and operational control.
Deﬁnition of the boiling range and the hydrocarbon type distribution in
heavy distillates and in residua is increasingly important. Feedstock analy-
sis to provide a quantitative boiling range distribution (that accounts for
noneluting components) as well as the distribution of hydrocarbon types in
gas oil and higher-boiling materials is important in evaluating feedstocks
for further processing.
Sulfur reduction processes are sensitive to both amount and structure 
of the sulfur compounds being removed. Tests that can provide informa-
tion about both of these factors are becoming increasingly important, and
analytical tests that provide information about other constituents of inter-
est (e.g., nitrogen, organometallic constituents) are also valuable and being
used for characterization.
29But before delving into the detailed aspects of petroleum product analy-
sis, it is necessary to understand the nature and character of petroleum as
well as the methods used to produce petroleum products. This will present
to the reader the background that is necessary to understand petroleum
and the processes used to convert it to products. The details of the chem-
istry are not presented here and can be found elsewhere (Speight, 1999,
2000; Speight and Ozum, 2002).
Thus it is the intent of this chapter to present an overview with some
degree of detail of the character of petroleum and the methods used to
produce products.The character of petroleum will be presented, for the pur-
poses of this chapter, by application of various analytical methods.
Sections relating to natural gas (a constituents of petroleum), natural gas
liquids, and natural gasoline are also included.
2.1.1. Deﬁnitions
Petroleum (also called crude oil ) is a naturally mixture of hydrocarbons,
generally in the liquid state, that may also include compounds of sulfur,
nitrogen, oxygen, and metals and other elements (ASTM D-4175; Speight,
2001 and references cited therein). Inorganic sediment and water may also
be present. Thus, for the purposes of this text, a petroleum product is any
product that is manufactured during petroleum reﬁning and, as a conse-
quence, petrochemical products are not included in this deﬁnition or in this
text.
Attempts have been made to deﬁne or classify petroleum based on
various distillation properties when combined with another property such
as density. It has been suggested that a crude should be called asphaltic if
the distillation residue contained less than 2% wax and parafﬁnic if it con-
tained more than 5%. A division according to the chemical composition of
the 250–300°C (480–570°F) fraction has also been suggested (Table 2.1).30 petroleum and petroleum products

above 200°C (390°F) the molecules can no longer be placed in one group
because most of them are of a typically mixed nature. Purely naphthenic or
aromatic molecules occur very seldom; cyclic compounds generally contain
parafﬁnic side chains and often even aromatic and naphthenic rings side by
side. More direct chemical information is often desirable and can be sup-
plied by means of the correlation index (CI).
The correlation index is based on the plot of speciﬁc gravity versus the
reciprocal of the boiling point in degrees Kelvin (oK =°C +273). For pure
hydrocarbons, the line described by the constants of the individual members"
"of the normal parafﬁn series is given a value of CI =0 and a parallel line
passing through the point for the values of benzene is given as CI =100
(Fig. 2.1); thus,

petroleum fraction as determined by the standard distillation method
(ASTM D-86, ASTM D-1160).
Values for the index between 0 and 15 indicate a predominance of par-
afﬁnic hydrocarbons in the fraction. A value from 15 to 50 indicates pre-
dominance of either naphthenes or mixtures of parafﬁns, naphthenes, and
aromatics. An index value above 50 indicates a predominance of aromatic
species. However, it cannot be forgotten that the data used to determine
the correlation index are average for the fraction of feedstock under study
and may not truly represent all constituents of the feedstock, especially
those at both ends of a range of physical and chemical properties.
Thus, because of the use of average data and the output of a value that
falls within a broad range, it is questionable whether or not this correlation
index offers realistic or reliable information. As the complexity of feed-
stocks increases from petroleum to heavy oil and beyond to tar sand
bitumen, especially with the considerable overlap of compound types, there
must be serious questions about the reliability of the number derived by
this method.
Another derived number, the UOP characterization factor, is also a
widely used method for deﬁning petroleum; the Characterization Factor is
derived from the formula:
K =3√T—
B/d
where TBis the average boiling point in degrees Rankine (°F +460) and d
is the speciﬁc gravity (60°/60°F). This factor has been shown to be additive
on a weight basis. It was originally devised to show the thermal cracking
characteristics of heavy oil. Thus, highly parafﬁnic oils have K=~12.5–13.0
and cyclic (naphthenic) oils have K=~10.5–12.5.
Again, because of the use of average data and the output of a value that
falls (in this case) within a narrow range, it is questionable whether or not
this characterization factor offers realistic or reliable information. Deter-
mining whether or not a feedstock is parafﬁnic is one issue, but one must
ask whether there is a real difference between feedstocks when the char-
acterization factor is 12.4 or 12.5 or even between feedstocks having char-
acterization factors of 12.4 and 13.0. As the complexity of feedstocks
increases from petroleum to heavy oil and beyond to tar sand bitumen,
especially with the considerable overlap of compound types, there must 
be serious questions about the reliability of the number derived by this
method.
The underlying premise for these methods of deﬁnition or classiﬁcation
is uniformity of the molecular nature of the feedstocks. This is not in fact32 petroleum and petroleum productsthe case, and when blends are employed as reﬁnery feedstocks, the methods
do not take into account any potential interactions between the constituents
of each member of the blend.
The most adequate deﬁnitions of petroleum come from legal documents,
where petroleum is deﬁned directly or by inference (Speight, 1999, 2000).
2.1.2. Composition
In all of these attempts at a deﬁnition or classiﬁcation of petroleum, it must
be remembered that petroleum exhibits wide variations in composition and
properties, and these variations not only occur in petroleum from different
ﬁelds but may also be manifested in petroleum taken from different pro-
duction depths in the same well. The mixture of hydrocarbons is highly
complex. Parafﬁnic, naphthenic, and aromatic structures can occur in the
same molecule, and the complexity increases with boiling range of the
petroleum fraction. In addition, petroleum varies in physical appearance
from a light-colored liquid to the more viscous heavy oil. The near-solid or
solid bitumen that occurs in tar sand deposits is different from petroleum
and heavy oil, as evidenced by the respective methods of recovery (Speight,
1999, 2000).
Elemental analysis of petroleum shows that the major constituents are
carbon and hydrogen with smaller amounts of sulfur (0.1–8% w/w), nitro-
gen (0.1–1.0% w/w), and oxygen (0.1–3% w/w), and trace elements such as
vanadium, nickel, iron, and copper present at the part per million (ppm)
level. Of the non-hydrocarbon (heteroelements) elements, sulfur is the most
abundant and often considered the most important by reﬁners. However,"
"nitrogen and the trace metals also have deleterious effects on reﬁnery cat-
alysts and should not be discounted because of relative abundance. Process
units with, for example, a capacity of 50,000bbl/day that are in operation
continuously can soon reﬂect the presence of the trace elements. The effect
of oxygen, which also has an effect on reﬁning catalysts, has received some-
what less study than the other heteroelements but remains equally impor-
tant in reﬁning.
Petroleum suitability for reﬁning (to produce a slate of predetermined
products) (Table 2.2) is determined by application of a series of analytical
methods (Speight, 2001) that provide information that is sufﬁcient to assess
the potential quality of the petroleum as a feedstock and also to indicate
whether any difﬁculties might arise in handling, reﬁning, or transportation.
Such information may be obtained either by (1) a preliminary assay of
petroleum or (2) a full assay of petroleum that involves presentation of a
true boiling point curve and the analysis of fractions throughout the full
range of petroleum.petroleum 332.2. PETROLEUM ASSA Y
An efﬁcient assay is derived from a series of test data that give an accurate
description of petroleum quality and allow an indication of its behavior
during reﬁning. The ﬁrst step is, of course, to ensure adequate (correct) 
sampling by use of the prescribed protocols (ASTM D-4057).
Thus analyses are performed to determine whether each batch of crude
oil received at the reﬁnery is suitable for reﬁning purposes. The tests are
also applied to determine whether there has been any contamination during
wellhead recovery, storage, or transportation that may increase the pro-
cessing difﬁculty (cost). The information required is generally crude oil
dependent or speciﬁc to a particular reﬁnery and is also a function of re-
ﬁnery operations and desired product slate.
To obtain the necessary information, two different analytical schemes are
commonly used. These are (1) an inspection assay and (2) a comprehensive
assay.
Inspection assays usually involve determination of several key bulk
properties of petroleum (e.g., API gravity, sulfur content, pour point, and
distillation range) as a means of determining whether major changes 
in characteristics have occurred since the last comprehensive assay was 
performed.
For example, a more detailed inspection assay might consist of the fol-
lowing tests: API gravity (or density or relative density), sulfur content,
pour point, viscosity, salt content, water and sediment content, trace metals34 petroleum and petroleum products

a comprehensive assay provide an estimate of any changes that have
occurred in the crude oil that may be critical to reﬁnery operations. Inspec-
tion assays are routinely performed on all crude oils received at a reﬁnery.
On the other hand, the comprehensive (or full) assay is more complex
(as well as time-consuming and costly) and is usually only performed only
when a new ﬁeld comes on stream, or when the inspection assay indicates
that signiﬁcant changes in the composition of the crude oil have occurred.
Except for these circumstances, a comprehensive assay of a particular crude
oil stream may not (unfortunately) be updated for several years.
In this section, as in others throughout this book, no preference is given
to any particular tests. All lists of tests are alphabetical.
2.2.1. Carbon Residue, Asphaltene Content
The carbon residues of petroleum and petroleum products serve as an indi-
cation of the propensity of the sample to form carbonaceous deposits
(thermal coke) under the inﬂuence of heat.
Tests for Conradson carbon residue (ASTM D-189, IP 13), Ramsbottom
carbon residue (ASTM D-524, IP 14), the microcarbon carbon residue
(ASTM D4530, IP 398), and asphaltene content (ASTM D-893, ASTM 
D-2006, ASTM D-2007, ASTM D-3279, ASTM D-4124, ASTM D-6560, IP
143) are sometimes included in inspection data on petroleum.The data give
an indication of the amount of coke that will be formed during thermal
processes as well as an indication of the amount of high-boiling constituents
in petroleum.
The determination of the carbon residue of petroleum or a petroleum"
"product is applicable to relatively nonvolatile samples that decompose on
distillation at atmospheric pressure. Samples that contain ash-forming con-
stituents will have an erroneously high carbon residue, depending on the
amount of ash formed. All three methods are applicable to relatively non-
volatile petroleum products that partially decompose on distillation at
atmospheric pressure. Crude oils having a low carbon residue may be dis-
tilled to a speciﬁed residue with the carbon residue test of choice then
applied to that residue.
In the Conradson carbon residue test (ASTM D-189, IP 13), a weighed
quantity of sample is placed in a crucible and subjected to destructive dis-
tillation for a ﬁxed period of severe heating. At the end of the speciﬁed
heating period, the test crucible containing the carbonaceous residue is
cooled in a desiccator and weighed and the residue is reported as a per-
centage (% w/w) of the original sample (Conradson carbon residue).
In the Ramsbottom carbon residue test (ASTM Test Method D524, IP
14), the sample is weighed into a glass bulb that has a capillary opening andpetroleum assay 35is placed into a furnace (at 550°C, 1022°F). The volatile matter is distilled
from the bulb and the nonvolatile matter that remains in the bulb decom-
poses to form thermal coke. After a speciﬁed heating period, the bulb is
removed from the bath, cooled in a desiccator, and weighed to report the
residue (Ramsbottom carbon residue) as a percentage (% w/w) of the orig-
inal sample.
In the microcarbon residue test (ASTM D4530, IP 398), a weighed quan-
tity of the sample placed in a glass vial is heated to 500°C (932°F) under an
inert (nitrogen) atmosphere in a controlled manner for a speciﬁc time and
the carbonaceous residue [ carbon residue (micro) ] is reported as a per-
centage (% w/w) of the original sample.
The data produced by the microcarbon test (ASTM D4530, IP 398) are
equivalent to those by the Conradson carbon residue method (ASTM D-
189 IP 13). However, this microcarbon test method offers better control of
test conditions and requires a smaller sample. Up to 12 samples can be run
simultaneously. This test method is applicable to petroleum and to petro-
leum products that partially decompose on distillation at atmospheric pres-
sure and is applicable to a variety of samples that generate a range of yields
(0.01% w/w to 30% w/w) of thermal coke.
As noted, in any of the carbon residue tests, ash-forming constituents
(ASTM D-482) or nonvolatile additives present in the sample will be
included in the total carbon residue reported, leading to higher carbon
residue values and erroneous conclusions about the coke-forming propen-
sity of the sample.
The asphaltene fraction (ASTM D-893, ASTM D-2006, ASTM D-2007,
ASTM D-3279, ASTM D-4124, ASTM D-6560, IP 143) is the highest-
molecular-weight, most complex fraction in petroleum. The asphaltene
content gives an indication of the amount of coke that can be expected
during processing (Speight, 1999; Speight, 2001, Speight and Ozum 2002).
In any of the methods for the determination of the asphaltene content,
the crude oil or product (such as asphalt) is mixed with a large excess
(usually >30 volumes hydrocarbon per volume of sample) of low-boiling
hydrocarbon such as n-pentane or n-heptane. For an extremely viscous
sample, a solvent such as toluene may be used before the addition of the
low-boiling hydrocarbon but an additional amount of the hydrocarbon
(usually >30 volumes hydrocarbon per volume of solvent) must be added
to compensate for the presence of the solvent. After a speciﬁed time, the
insoluble material (the asphaltene fraction) is separated (by ﬁltration) and
dried. The yield is reported as percentage (% w/w) of the original sample.
It must be recognized that, in any of these tests, different hydrocarbons
(such as n-pentane or n-heptane) will give different yields of the asphal-
tene fraction and if the presence of the solvent is not compensated for by
use of additional hydrocarbon the yield will be erroneous. In addition, if the36 petroleum and petroleum productshydrocarbon is not present in large excess, the yields of the asphaltene frac-
tion will vary and will be erroneous (Speight, 1999).
The precipitation number is often equated to the asphaltene content, but
there are several issues that remain obvious in its rejection for this purpose.
For example, the method used to determine the precipitation number
(ASTM D-91) advocates the use of naphtha for use with black oil or lubri-
cating oil and the amount of insoluble material (as a % v/v of the sample)
is the precipitation number. In the test, 10 ml of sample is mixed with 90 ml
of ASTM precipitation naphtha (which may or may nor have a constant
chemical composition) in a graduated centrifuge cone and centrifuged for
10 min at 600–700rpm. The volume of material on the bottom of the cen-
trifuge cone is noted until repeat centrifugation gives a value within 0.1 ml"
"(the precipitation number). Obviously, this can be substantially different
from the asphaltene content.
2.2.2. Density (Speciﬁc Gravity)
For clariﬁcation, it is necessary to understand the basic deﬁnitions that are
used: (1) density is the mass of liquid per unit volume at 15°C; (2) relative
density is the ratio of the mass of a given volume of liquid at 15°C to the
mass of an equal volume of pure water at the same temperature; (3) 
speciﬁc gravity is the same as the relative density and the terms are used
interchangeably.
Density (ASTM D-1298, IP 160) is an important property of petroleum
products because petroleum and especially petroleum products are usually
bought and sold on that basis or, if on a volume basis, then converted to
mass basis via density measurements.This property is almost synonymously
termed as density, relative density, gravity, and speciﬁc gravity, all terms
related to each other. Usually a hydrometer, pycnometer, or more modern
digital density meter is used for the determination of density or speciﬁc
gravity (ASTM 2000; Speight, 2001).
In the most commonly used method (ASTM D-1298, IP 160), the sample
is brought to the prescribed temperature and transferred to a cylinder 
at approximately the same temperature. The appropriate hydrometer is
lowered into the sample and allowed to settle, and, after temperature equi-
librium has been reached, the hydrometer scale is read and the tempera-
ture of the sample is noted.
Although there are many methods for the determination of density
because of the different nature of petroleum itself and the different prod-
ucts, one test method (ASTM D-5002) is used for the determination of the
density or relative density of petroleum that can be handled in a normal
fashion as liquids at test temperatures between 15 and 35°C (59 and 95°F).
This test method applies to petroleum products with high vapor pressurespetroleum assay 37provided appropriate precautions are taken to prevent vapor loss during
transfer of the sample to the density analyzer. In the method, approximately 
0.7ml of crude oil sample is introduced into an oscillating sample tube and
the change in oscillating frequency caused by the change in mass of the tube
is used in conjunction with calibration data to determine the density of 
the sample.
Another test determines density and speciﬁc gravity by means of a digital
densimeter (ASTM D-4052, IP 365). In the test, a small volume (approxi-
mately 0.7 ml) of liquid sample is introduced into an oscillating sample tube
and the change in oscillating frequency caused by the change in the mass
of the tube is used in conjunction with calibration data to determine the
density of the sample. The test is usually applied to petroleum, petroleum
distillates, and petroleum products that are liquids at temperatures between
15 and 35°C (59 and 95°F) and have vapor pressures below 600mmHg 
and viscosities below about 15,000cSt at the temperature of the test. How-
ever, the method should not be applied to samples so dark in color that 
the absence of air bubbles in the sample cell cannot be established with 
certainty.
Accurate determination of the density or speciﬁc gravity of crude oil is
necessary for the conversion of measured volumes to volumes at the stan-
dard temperature of 15.56°C (60°F) (ASTM D-1250, IP 200, Petroleum
Measurement Tables). The speciﬁc gravity is also a factor reﬂecting the
quality of crude oils.
The accurate determination of the API gravity of petroleum and its prod-
ucts is necessary for the conversion of measured volumes to volumes at the
standard temperature of 60°F (15.56°C). Gravity is a factor governing the
quality of crude oils. However, the gravity of a petroleum product is an
uncertain indication of its quality. Correlated with other properties, gravity
can be used to give approximate hydrocarbon composition and heat of com-
bustion. This is usually accomplished though use of the API gravity, which
is derived from the speciﬁc gravity:
API gravity (degrees) =(141.5/sp gr 60/60°F) – 131.5
and is also a critical measure for reﬂecting the quality of petroleum.
API gravity or density or relative density can be determined using one
of two hydrometer methods (ASTM D-287, ASTM D-1298). The use of a
digital analyzer (ASTM D-5002) is ﬁnding increasing popularity for the
measurement of density and speciﬁc gravity.
In the method (ASTM D-287), the API gravity is determined using a
glass hydrometer for petroleum and petroleum products that are normally
handled as liquids and that have a Reid vapor pressure of 26 psi (180 kPa)
or less. The API gravity is determined at 15.6°C (60°F), or converted 38 petroleum and petroleum productsto values at 60°F, by means of standard tables. These tables are not appli-
cable to non-hydrocarbons or essentially pure hydrocarbons such as the
aromatics.
This test method is based on the principle that the gravity of a liquid
varies directly with the depth of immersion of a body ﬂoating in it. The API"
"gravity is determined with an hydrometer by observing the freely ﬂoating
API hydrometer and noting the graduation nearest to the apparent inter-
section of the horizontal plane surface of the liquid with the vertical scale
of the hydrometer after temperature equilibrium has been reached. The
temperature of the sample is determined with a standard test thermometer
that is immersed in the sample or with the thermometer that is an integral
part of the hydrometer (thermohydrometer).
2.2.3. Distillation
The distillation tests give an indication of the types of products and the
quality of the products that can be obtained from petroleum, and the tests
are used to compare different petroleum types through the yield and quality
of the 300°C (572°F) residuum fraction. For example, the waxiness or vis-
cosity of this fraction gives an indication of the amount, types, and quality
of the residual fuel that can be obtained from the petroleum. In this respect,
the determination of the aniline point (ASTM D-611, IP 2) can be used to
determine the aromatic or aliphatic character of petroleum. Although not
necessarily the same as the wax content, correlative relationships can be
derived from the data.
The basic method of distillation (ASTM D-86) is one of the oldest
methods in use because the distillation characteristics of hydrocarbons have
an important effect on safety and performance, especially in the case of
fuels and solvents. The boiling range gives information on the composition,
the properties, and the behavior of petroleum and derived products during
storage and use. Volatility is the major determinant of the tendency of a
hydrocarbon mixture to produce potentially explosive vapors. Several
methods are available to deﬁne the distillation characteristics of petroleum
and its various petroleum products. In addition to these physical methods,
other test methods based on gas chromatography are also used to derive
the boiling point distribution of a sample (ASTM D-2887, ASTM D-3710,
ASTM D-5307, ASTM D-6352).
In the preliminary assay of petroleum the method of distillation is often
used to give a rough indication of the boiling range of the crude (ASTM
D-2892, IP 123). The test is carried out at atmospheric pressure and is
stopped at 300°C (572°F) to avoid thermal decomposition. The distillate
and the residuum can be further examined by tests such as speciﬁc gravity
(ASTM D-1298, IP 160), sulfur content (ASTM D-129, IP 61), and viscos-petroleum assay 39ity (ASTM D-445, IP 71). In fact, the use of a method (ASTM D-2569)
developed for the determining the distillation characteristics of pitch allows
further examination of residua.
In addition to the whole crude oil tests performed as part of the inspec-
tion assay, a comprehensive or full assay requires that the crude be frac-
tionally distilled and the fractions characterized by the relevant tests.
Fractionation of the crude oil begins with a true boiling point (TBP) dis-
tillation using a fractionating column with an efﬁciency of 14–18 theor-
etical plates and operated at a reﬂux ratio of 5 :1 (ASTM D-2892). The 
TBP distillation may be used for all fractions up to a maximum cut point
of about 350°C atmospheric equivalent temperature (AET), but a low 
residence time in the still (or reduced pressure) is needed to minimize
cracking.
It is often useful to extend the boiling point data to higher temperatures
than are possible in the fractionating distillation method previously de-
scribed, and for this purpose a vacuum distillation in a simple still with 
no fractionating column (ASTM D-1160) can be carried out. This distilla-
tion, which is done under fractionating conditions equivalent to one theo-
retical plate, allows the boiling point data to be extended to about 600°C
(1112°F) with many crude oils. This method gives useful comparative and
reproducible results that are often accurate enough for reﬁnery purposes,
provided signiﬁcant cracking does not occur.
Usually seven fractions provide the basis for a reasonably thorough 
evaluation of the distillation properties of the feedstock:
1. Gas, boiling range: <15.5°C (60°F)
2. Gasoline (light naphtha), boiling range: l5.5–149°C (60–300°F)
3. Kerosene (medium naphtha), boiling range: 149–232°C (300–450°F)
4. Gas oil, boiling range: 232–343°C (450–650°F)
5. Light vacuum gas oil, boiling range: 343–371°C (650–700°F)
6. Heavy vacuum gas oil, boiling range: 371–566°C (700–1050°F)
7. Residuum, boiling range: >566°C (1050°F)
From 5 to 50 liters of crude oil are necessary to complete a full assay,
depending on the number of fractions to be taken and the tests to be per-
formed on the fractions.
A more recent test method (ASTM D-5236) is seeing increasing use and
appears to be the method of choice for crude assay vacuum distillations.
Wiped-wall or thin-ﬁlm molecular stills can also be used to separate the
higher-boiling fractions under conditions that minimize cracking. In these"
"units, however, cut points cannot be directly selected because vapor tem-
perature in the distillation column cannot be measured accurately under40 petroleum and petroleum productsoperating conditions. Instead, the wall (ﬁlm) temperature, pressure, and
feed rate that will produce a fraction with a given end point are determined
from in-house correlations developed by matching yields between the
wiped-wall distillation and the conventional distillation (ASTM D-l160,
ASTM D-5236). And wiped-wall stills are often used because they allow
higher end points and can easily provide sufﬁcient quantities of the frac-
tions for characterization purposes.
2.2.4. Light Hydrocarbons
The amount of the individual light hydrocarbons in petroleum (methane to
butane or pentane) is often included as part of the preliminary assay.
Although one of the more conventional distillation procedures might be
used, the determination of light hydrocarbons in petroleum is best is carried
out with a gas chromatographic method (ASTM D-2427).
2.2.5. Metallic Constituents
Petroleum, as recovered from the reservoir, contains metallic constituents
but also picks up metallic constituents during recovery, transportation, and
storage. Even trace amounts of these metals can be deleterious to reﬁning
processes, especially processes in which catalysts are used. Trace compo-
nents, such as metallic constituents, can also produce adverse effects in
reﬁning either (1) by causing corrosion or (2) by affecting the quality of
reﬁned products.
Hence, it is important to have test methods that can determine metals,
both at trace levels and at major concentrations. Thus test methods have
evolved that are used for the determination of speciﬁc metals as well as the
multielement methods of determination using techniques such as atomic
absorption spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spec-
trometry, and X-ray ﬂuorescence spectroscopy.
Nickel and vanadium along with iron and sodium (from the brine) are
the major metallic constituents of crude oil.These metals can be determined
by atomic absorption spectrophotometric methods (ASTM D-5863, IP 285,
IP 288, IP 465), wavelength-dispersive X-ray ﬂuorescence spectrometry (IP
433), and inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICPES).
Several other analytical methods are available for the routine determina-
tion of trace elements in crude oil, some of which allow direct aspiration of
the samples (diluted in a solvent) instead of time-consuming sample prepa-
ration procedures such as wet ashing (acid decomposition) or ﬂame or dry
ashing (removal of volatile/combustible constituents) (ASTM D-5863).
Among the techniques used for trace element determinations are conduc-
tivity (IP 265), ﬂameless and ﬂame atomic absorption (AA) spectropho-petroleum assay 41tometry (ASTM D-2788, ASTM D-5863), and inductively coupled argon
plasma (ICP) spectrophotometry (ASTM D-5708).
Inductively coupled argon plasma emission spectrophotometry (ASTM
D-5708) has an advantage over atomic absorption spectrophotometry
(ASTM D-4628, ASTM D-5863) because it can provide more complete ele-
mental composition data than the atomic absorption method. Flame emis-
sion spectroscopy is often used successfully in conjunction with atomic
absorption spectrophotometry (ASTM D-3605). X-ray ﬂuorescence spec-
trophotometry (ASTM D-4927, ASTM D-6443) is also sometimes used, but
matrix effects can be a problem.
The method to be used for the determination of metallic constituents in
petroleum is often a matter of individual preference.
2.2.6. Salt Content
The salt content of crude oil is highly variable and results principally from
production practices used in the ﬁeld and, to a lesser extent, from its 
handling aboard the tankers bringing it to terminals. The bulk of the salt
present will be dissolved in coexisting water and can be removed in
desalters, but small amounts of salt may be dissolved in the crude oil itself.
Salt may be derived from reservoir or formation waters or from other
waters used in secondary recovery operations.Aboard tankers, ballast water
of varying salinity may also be a source of salt contamination.
Salt in crude oil may be deleterious in several ways. Even in small con-
centrations, salts will accumulate in stills, heaters, and exchangers, lead-
ing to fouling that requires expensive cleanup. More importantly, during
ﬂash vaporization of crude oil certain metallic salts can be hydrolyzed to
hydrochloric acid according to the following reactions:
2NaCl +H2O Æ2 HCl +Na 2O 
MgCl 2+H2O Æ2 HCl +MgO
The hydrochloric acid evolved is extremely corrosive, necessitating the
injection of a basic compound, such as ammonia, into the overhead lines to
minimize corrosion damage. Salts and evolved acids can also contaminate
both overhead and residual products, and certain metallic salts can de-
activate catalysts.
Thus knowledge of the content of salt in crude oil is important in decid-"
"ing whether and to what extent the crude oil needs desalting.
The salt content is determined by potentiometric titration in a non-
aqueous solution in which the conductivity of a solution of crude oil in a
polar solvent is compared with that of a series of standard salt solutions in42 petroleum and petroleum productsthe same solvent (ASTM D-3230). In this method, the sample is dissolved
in a mixed solvent and placed in a test cell consisting of a beaker and two
parallel stainless steel plates. An alternating voltage is passed through the
plates, and the salt content is obtained by reference to a calibration curve
of the relationship of salt content of known mixtures to the current.
It is necessary, however, to use other methods, such as atomic absorp-
tion, inductively coupled argon plasma emission spectrophotometry, and
ion chromatography to determine the composition of the salts present. A
method involving application of extraction and volumetric titration is also
used (IP 77).
2.2.7. Sulfur Content
Sulfur is present in petroleum as sulﬁdes, thiophenes, benzothiophenes, and
dibenzothiophenes. In most cases, the presence of sulfur is detrimental to the
processing because sulfur can act as catalytic poisons during processing.
The sulfur content of petroleum is an important property and varies
widely within the rough limits 0.1% w/w to 3.0% w/w, and a sulfur content
up to 8.0% w/w has been noted for tar sand bitumen. Compounds con-
taining this element are among the most undesirable constituents of pe-
troleum because they can give rise to plant corrosion and atmospheric
pollution. Petroleum can evolve hydrogen sulﬁde during distillation as well
as low-boiling sulfur compounds.
Hydrogen sulﬁde may be evolved during the distillation process either
from free hydrogen sulﬁde in the feedstocks or because of low-temperature
thermal decomposition of sulfur compounds; the latter is less likely than
the former. Generally, however, the sulfur compounds concentrate in the
distillation residue (Speight, 2000), the volatile sulfur compounds in the 
distillates being removed by such processes as hydroﬁning and caustic wash-
ing (Speight, 1999). The sulfur content of fuels obtained from petroleum
residua and the atmospheric pollution arising from the use of these fuels is
an important factor in petroleum utilization, so that the increasing insis-
tence on a low-sulfur-content fuel oil has increased the value of low-sulfur
petroleum.
Sulfur compounds contribute to corrosion of reﬁnery equipment and poi-
soning of catalysts, cause corrosiveness in reﬁned products, and contribute
to environmental pollution as a result of the combustion of fuel products.
Sulfur compounds may be present throughout the boiling range of crude oils
although, as a rule, they are more abundant in the higher-boiling fractions.
In some crude oils, thermally labile sulfur compounds can decompose on
heating to produce hydrogen sulﬁde, which is corrosive and toxic.
A considerable number of tests are available to estimate the sulfur in
petroleum or to study its effect on various products. Hydrogen sulﬁde dis-petroleum assay 43solved in petroleum is normally determined by absorption of the hydrogen
sulﬁde in a suitable solution that is subsequently analyzed chemically
(Doctor method) (ASTM, D-4952, IP 30) or by the formation of cadmium
sulfate (IP 103).
The Doctor test measures the amount of sulfur available to react with
metallic surfaces at the temperature of the test. The rates of reaction are
metal type-, temperature-, and time dependent. In the test, a sample is
treated with copper powder at 149°C or 300°F. The copper powder is 
ﬁltered from the mixture. Active sulfur is calculated from the difference
between the sulfur contents of the sample (ASTM D-129) before and after
treatment with copper.
Sulfur that is chemically combined as an organic constituent of crude is
usually estimated by oxidizing a sample in a bomb and converting the sulfur
compounds to barium sulfate that is determined gravimetrically (ASTM D-
129, IP 61). This method is applicable to any sample of sufﬁciently low
volatility (e.g., a residuum or tar sand bitumen) that can be weighed accu-
rately in an open sample boat and that contains at least 0.1% sulfur. In this
method, the sample is oxidized by combustion in a pressure vessel (bomb)
containing oxygen under pressure. The sulfur in the sample is converted 
to sulfate and from the bomb washings is gravimetrically determined as
barium sulfate. However, the method is not applicable to samples contain-
ing elements that give residues, other than barium sulfate, that are inso-
luble in dilute hydrochloric acid and would interfere in the precipitation
step. In addition, the method is also subject to inaccuracies that arise from
interference by the sediment inherently present in petroleum.
Until recently, one of the most widely used methods for determination
of total sulfur content has been combustion of a sample in oxygen to"
"convert the sulfur to sulfur dioxide, which is collected and subsequently
titrated iodometrically or detected by nondispersive infrared (ASTM D-
1552). This method is particularly applicable to heavier oil and fractions
such as residua that boil above 177°C (350°F) and contain more than 0.06%
w/w sulfur. In addition, the sulfur content of petroleum coke containing up
to 8% w/w sulfur can be determined.
In the iodate detection system, the sample is burned in a stream of
oxygen at a sufﬁciently high temperature to convert the sulfur to sulfur
dioxide.The combustion products are passed into an absorber that contains
an acidic solution of potassium iodide and starch indicator. A faint blue
color is developed in the absorber solution by the addition of standard
potassium iodate solution and as combustion proceeds, bleaching the blue
color, more iodate is added. From the amount of standard iodate consumed
during the combustion, the sulfur content of the sample is calculated.
In the infrared detection system, the sample is weighed into a special
ceramic boat that is then placed into a combustion furnace at 1371°C44 petroleum and petroleum products(2500°F) in an oxygen atmosphere. Moisture and dust are removed with
traps, and the sulfur dioxide is measured with an infrared detector.
The lamp combustion method (ASTM D-1266, IP 107) and the 
Wickbold combustion method (IP 243) are used for the determination 
of sulfur in petroleum and as trace quantities of total sulfur in petroleum
products and are related to various other methods (ASTM D-2384, ASTM
D-2784, ASTM D-2785, ASTM D-4045) 
In the lamp method (ASTM D-1266, IP 107), a sample is burned in a
closed system using a suitable lamp and an artiﬁcial atmosphere composed
of 70% carbon dioxide and 30% oxygen to prevent formation of nitrogen
oxides.The sulfur oxides are absorbed and oxidized to sulfuric acid (H 2SO 4)
by means of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) solution that is then ﬂushed with
air to remove dissolved carbon dioxide. Sulfur as sulfate in the absorbent
is determined acidimetrically by titration with standard sodium hydroxide
(NaOH) solution. Alternatively, the sample can be burned in air and the
sulfur as sulfate in the absorbent determined gravimetrically as barium
sulfate (BaSO 4) after precipitation. If the sulfur content of the sample is
less than 0.01% w/w, it is necessary to determine sulfur in the absorber solu-
tion turbidimetrically as barium sulfate.
The older, classic techniques for sulfur determination are being sup-
planted by two instrumental methods (ASTM D-2622,ASTM D-4294,IP 447).
In the ﬁrst method (ASTM D-2622), the sample is placed in an X-ray
beam, and the peak intensity of the sulfur K aline at 5.373Å is measured.
The background intensity, measured at 5.190Å, is subtracted from the peak
intensity, and the resultant net counting rate is then compared with a pre-
viously prepared calibration curve or equation to obtain the sulfur con-
centration in % w/w.
The second method (ASTM D-4294, IP 477) uses energy-dispersive X-
ray ﬂuorescence spectroscopy, has slightly better repeatability and repro-
ducibility than the high-temperature method, and is adaptable to ﬁeld
applications but can be affected by some commonly present interferences
such as halides. In this method, the sample is placed in a beam emitted from
an X-ray source. The resultant excited characteristic X radiation is meas-
ured, and the accumulated count is compared with counts from previously
prepared calibration standard to obtain the sulfur concentration. Two
groups of calibration standards are required to span the concentration
range, one standard ranges from 0.015% to 0.1% w/w sulfur and the other
from 0.1% to 5.0% w/w sulfur.
2.2.8. Viscosity and Pour Point
Viscosity and pour point determinations are performed principally to ascer-
tain the handling (ﬂow) characteristics of petroleum at low temperatures.petroleum assay 45There are, however, some general relationships of crude oil composition
that can be derived from pour point and viscosity data. Commonly, the
lower the pour point of a crude oil the more aromatic it is, and the higher
the pour point the more parafﬁnic it is.
Viscosity is usually determined at different temperatures (e.g., 25°C/77°F,
and 100°C/212°F) by measuring the time for a volume of liquid to ﬂow
under gravity through a calibrated glass capillary viscometer (ASTM 
D-445).
In the test, the time for a ﬁxed volume of liquid to ﬂow under gravity
through the capillary of a calibrated viscometer under a reproducible
driving head and at a closely controlled temperature is measured in seconds.
The kinematic viscosity is the product of the measured ﬂow time and the
calibration constant of the viscometer. Conversion of the kinematic viscos-
ity in centistokes (cSt) at any temperature to Saybolt Universal viscosity in
Saybolt Universal seconds (SUS) at the same temperature and for con-
verting kinematic viscosity in centistokes at 122 and 210°F to Saybolt Furol"
"viscosity in Saybolt Furol seconds (SFS) at the same temperatures (ASTM
D-2161) is avaibale through formulae.
The viscosity index (ASTM D-2270, IP 226) is a widely used measure 
of the variation in kinematic viscosity due to changes in the temperature of
petroleum between 40°C and 100°C (104°F and 212°F). For crude oils of
similar kinematic viscosity, the higher the viscosity index the smaller is the
effect of temperature on its kinematic viscosity. The accuracy of the calcu-
lated viscosity index is dependent only on the accuracy of the original vis-
cosity determination.
The pour point of petroleum is an index of the lowest temperature at
which the crude oil will ﬂow under speciﬁed conditions. The maximum and
minimum pour point temperatures provide a temperature window where
petroleum, depending on its thermal history, might appear in the liquid as
well as the solid state. The pour point data can be used to supplement other
measurements of cold ﬂow behavior, and the data are particularly useful
for the screening of the effect of wax interaction modiﬁers on the ﬂow
behavior of petroleum.
In the original (and still widely used) test for pour point (ASTM D-97,
IP 15), a sample is cooled at a speciﬁed rate and examined at intervals of
3°C (5.4°F) for ﬂow characteristics. The lowest temperature at which the
movement of the oil is observed is recorded as the pour point.
A later test method (ASTM D-5853) covers two procedures for the
determination of the pour point of crude oils down to –36°C. One method
provides a measure of the maximum (upper) pour point temperature. The
second method measures the minimum (lower) pour point temperature. In
these methods, the test specimen is cooled (after preliminary heating) at a
speciﬁed rate and examined at intervals of 3°C (5.4°F) for ﬂow character-46 petroleum and petroleum productsistics. Again, the lowest temperature at which movement of the test speci-
men is observed is recorded as the pour point.
In any determination of the pour point, petroleum that contains wax pro-
duces an irregular ﬂow behavior when the wax begins to separate. Such
petroleum possesses viscosity relationships that are difﬁcult to predict in
pipeline operation. In addition, some waxy petroleum is sensitive to heat
treatment that can also affect the viscosity characteristics. This complex
behavior limits the value of viscosity and pour point tests on waxy petro-
leum. However, laboratory pumpability tests (ASTM D-3245, IP 230) are
available that give an estimate of minimum handling temperature and
minimum line or storage temperature.
2.2.9. Water and Sediment
Considerable importance is attached to the presence of water or sediment
in petroleum because they lead to difﬁculties in the reﬁnery, for example,
corrosion of equipment, uneven running on the distillation unit, blockages
in heat exchangers, and adverse effects on product quality.
The water and sediment content of crude oil, like salt, results from pro-
duction and transportation practices. Water, with its dissolved salts, may
occur as easily removable suspended droplets or as an emulsion. The sedi-
ment dispersed in crude oil may be comprised of inorganic minerals from
the production horizon or from drilling ﬂuids and scale and rust from
pipelines and tanks used for oil transportation and storage. Usually water
is present in far greater amounts than sediment, but, collectively, it is
unusual for them to exceed 1% of the crude oil on a delivered basis. Like
salt, water and sediment can foul heaters, stills, and exchangers and can con-
tribute to corrosion and to deleterious product quality. Also, water and 
sediment are principal components of the sludge that accumulates in
storage tanks and must be disposed of periodically in an environmentally
acceptable manner. Knowledge of the water and sediment content is also
important in accurately determining net volumes of crude oil in sales,
taxation, exchanges, and custody transfers.
The sediment consists of ﬁnely divided solids that may be drilling mud
or sand or scale picked up during the transport of the oil or may consist of
chlorides derived from evaporation of brine droplets in the oil. The solids
may be dispersed in the oil or carried in water droplets. Sediment in petro-
leum can lead to serious plugging of equipment, corrosion due to chloride
decomposition, and a lowering of residual fuel quality.
Water may be found in the crude either in an emulsiﬁed form or in large
droplets and can cause ﬂooding of distillation units and excessive accumu-
lation of sludge in tanks. Reﬁners generally limit the quantity, and although
steps are normally taken at the oil ﬁeld to reduce the water content as muchpetroleum assay 47as possible, water may be introduced later during shipment. In any form,
water and sediment are highly undesirable in a reﬁnery feedstock, and the
relevant tests involving distillation (ASTM D-95, ASTM D-4006, IP 74, IP"
"358), centrifuging (ASTM D-96, ASTM D-4007), extraction (ASTM D-473,
IP 53), and the Karl Fischer titration (ASTM D-4377, ASTM D-4928, IP
356, IP 386, IP 438, IP 439) are regarded as important in petroleum quality
examinations.
Before the assay it is sometimes necessary to separate the water from a
petroleum sample. Certain types of petroleum, notably heavy oil, often form
persistent emulsions that are difﬁcult to separate. On the other hand, in
testing wax-bearing petroleum for sediment and water care must be taken
to ensure that wax suspended in the sample is brought into solution before
the test; otherwise it will be recorded as sediment.
The Karl Fischer test method (ASTM D-1364,ASTM D-6304) covers the
direct determination of water in petroleum. In the test, the sample injec-
tion in the titration vessel can be performed on a volumetric or gravimetric
basis.Viscous samples can be analyzed with a water vaporizer accessory that
heats the sample in the evaporation chamber, and the vaporized water is
carried into the Karl Fischer titration cell by a dry, inert carrier gas.
Water and sediment in petroleum can be determined simultaneously
(ASTM D-96, ASTM D-4007, IP 359) by the centrifuge method. Known
volumes of petroleum and solvent are placed in a centrifuge tube and
heated to 60°C (140°F). After centrifugation, the volume of the sediment-
and-water layer at the bottom of the tube is read. For petroleum that con-
tains wax, a temperature of 71°C (160°F) or higher may be required to
completely melt the wax crystals so that they are not measured as sediment.
Sediment is also determined by an extraction method (ASTM D-473, IP
53) or by membrane ﬁltration (ASTM D-4807). In the former method
(ASTM D-473, IP 53), an oil sample contained in a refractory thimble is
extracted with hot toluene until the residue reaches a constant mass. In the
latter test, the sample is dissolved in hot toluene and ﬁltered under vacuum
through a 0.45- mm-porosity membrane ﬁlter. The ﬁlter with residue is
washed, dried, and weighed.
2.2.10. Wax Content
Petroleum with a high wax content presents difﬁculties in handling and
pumping as well as producing distillate and residual fuels of high pour point
and lubricating oils that are costly to dewax.
All the standard methods for the determination of wax involve precipi-
tating the wax from solvents such as methylene chloride or acetone under
speciﬁed conditions of solvent-to-oil ratio and temperature. Measurements
such as these give comparative results that are often useful in characteriz-48 petroleum and petroleum productsing the wax content of petroleum or for investigating factors involved in
ﬂow problems.
On the other hand, the wax appearance point (ASTM D-3117) may be
determined by cooling of a sample under prescribed conditions with stir-
ring. The temperature at which the wax ﬁrst appears is the wax appearance
point.
2.2.11. Other Tests
The inspection assay tests discussed above are not exhaustive but are the
ones most commonly used and provide data on the impurities present as
well as a general idea of the products that may be recoverable. Other prop-
erties that are determined on an as-needed basis include, but are not limited
to, the following: (1) vapor pressure (Reid method) (ASTM D-323, IP 69,
IP 402), (2) total acid number (ASTM D-664, IP 177), and chloride content
(ASTM D-4929, IP 244).
The Reid vapor pressure test method (ASTM D-323, IP 69) measures the
vapor pressure of volatile petroleum. The Reid vapor pressure differs 
from the true vapor pressure of the sample because of some small sample
vaporization and the presence of water vapor and air in the conﬁned space.
The acid number is the quantity of base, expressed in milligrams of potas-
sium hydroxide per gram of sample, that is required to titrate a sample in
this solvent to a green/green-brown end point, using p-naphtholbenzein
indicator solution.The strong acid number is the quantity of base, expressed
as milligrams of potassium hydroxide per gram of sample, required to titrate
a sample in the solvent from its initial meter reading to a meter reading
corresponding to a freshly prepared nonaqueous acidic buffer solution or
a well-deﬁned inﬂection point as speciﬁed in the test method (ASTM D-
664, IP 177).
To determine the acid number by the color indicator method (ASTM D-
974, IP 139), the sample is dissolved in a mixture of toluene and isopropyl
alcohol containing a small amount of water and the resulting single-phase
solution is titrated at room temperature with standard alcoholic base or
alcoholic acid solution, respectively, to the end point indicated by the color
change of the added p-naphtholbenzein solution (orange in acid and green-
brown in base). To determine the strong acid number, a separate portion of
the sample is extracted with hot water and the aqueous extract is titrated
with potassium hydroxide solution, using methyl orange as an indicator."
"To determine the acid number by the potentiometric titration method
(ASTM D-664, IP 177), the sample is dissolved in a mixture of toluene and
isopropyl alcohol containing a small amount of water and titrated poten-
tiometrically with alcoholic potassium hydroxide using a glass indicating
electrode and a calomel reference electrode.The meter readings are plottedpetroleum assay 49manually or automatically against the respective volumes of titrating solu-
tion, and the end points are taken only at well-deﬁned inﬂections in the
resulting curve. When no deﬁnite inﬂections are obtained, end points are
taken at meter readings corresponding to those found for freshly prepared
nonaqueous acidic and basic buffer solutions.
The acid numbers obtained by this color indicator test method (ASTM
D-974, IP 139) may or may not be numerically the same as those obtained
by the potentiometric titration method (ASTM D-664, IP 177). In addition,
the color of the crude oil sample can interfere with observation of the end
point when the color indicator method is used. Determination of the acid
number is more appropriate for various petroleum products.
The test method for the determination of the acid number by the color
indicator titration method (ASTM D-3339, IP 431) measures the acid
number of oils obtained from a laboratory oxidation test (ASTM D-943)
using smaller amounts of samples than those used in other acid number
tests (ASTM D-664, ASTM D-974, IP 139, IP 177).
In this test, the sample is dissolved in a solvent mixture of toluene, iso-
propyl alcohol, and a small amount of water and the solution is titrated at
room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere with standard potassium
hydroxide (KOH) in isopropyl alcohol to the stable green color of the
added indicator p-naphtholbenzein. Dark-colored crude oils (and crude oil
products) are more difﬁcult to analyze by this method because of the dif-
ﬁculty in detecting color change. In such cases, the potentiometric titra-
tion method (ASTM D-664, IP 177) may be used if sufﬁcient sample is
available.
The acid numbers will not provide the data essential to determining
whether a speciﬁc petroleum or a blend with other crude oils will yield the
desired product slate. Such data can only be generated when a compre-
hensive petroleum assay is performed and the data from several tests are
taken in relation to each other.
The aniline point (or mixed aniline point ) (ASTM D-611, IP 2) has been
used for the characterization of crude oil, although it is more applicable to
pure hydrocarbons and in their mixtures and is used to estimate the aro-
matic content of mixtures. Aromatics exhibit the lowest aniline points and
parafﬁns the highest aniline points. Cycloparafﬁns and oleﬁns exhibit values
between these two extremes. In any hydrocarbon homologous series the
aniline point increases with increasing molecular weight.
With the data derived from the test assay, it is possible to assess petro-
leum quality to acquire a degree of predictability of performance during
reﬁning. However, a knowledge of the basic concepts of reﬁning will help
the analyst understand the production and, to a large extent, the anticipated
properties of the product, which in turn are related to storage, sampling,
and handling of the products.50 petroleum and petroleum products2.3. PETROLEUM REFINING
Petroleum is rarely used in its raw form but must instead be processed into
its various products, generally as a means of forming products with a hydro-
gen content different from that of the original feedstock. Thus the chem-
istry of the reﬁning process is concerned primarily with the production not
only of better products but also of salable materials.
Petroleum contains many thousands of different compounds that vary in
molecular weight from 16 (methane, CH 4,) to more than 2000 (Speight,
1999, 2001 and references cited therein). This broad range in molecular
weights results in boiling points that range from –160 ∞C (–288∞F) to tem-
peratures in excess of 1100°C (2000 ∞F) (Speight, 2001).
In brief, a reﬁnery must be recognized as a complex network of inte-
grated unit processes for the purpose of producing a variety of products
from petroleum (Fig. 2.2) (Speight, 1999; Speight and Ozum, 2002). Each
reﬁnery has its own range of preferred petroleum feedstock from which 
a desired distribution of products is obtained. Nevertheless, reﬁnery pro-
cesses can be divided into three major types:
1.Separation : division of petroleum into various streams (or fractions)
depending on the nature of the crude material.
2.Conversion : production of salable materials from petroleum, usually
by skeletal alteration, or even by alteration of the chemical type, of
the petroleum constituents.
3.Finishing : puriﬁcation of various product streams by a variety of
processes that essentially remove impurities from the product; for
convenience, processes that accomplish molecular alteration, such as
reforming , are also included in this category."
"The separation and ﬁnishing processes may involve distillation or even
treatment with a wash solution, either to remove impurities or, in the case
of distillation, to produce a material boiling over a narrower range, and the
chemistry of these processes is quite simple.
Conversion processes are, in essence, processes that change the number
of carbon atoms per molecule, alter the molecular hydrogen-to-carbon
ratio, or change the molecular structure of the material without affecting
the number of carbon atoms per molecule (Fig. 2.2). These latter processes
(isomerization processes ) essentially change the shape of the molecule(s)
and are used to improve the quality of the product (Speight, 1999; Speight
and Ozum, 2002).
Thermal cracking processes are commonly used to convert petroleum
residua into distillable liquid products; examples of thermal cracking
processes currently in use are visbreaking and coking (delayed coking ,petroleum reﬁning 51ﬂuid coking , and ﬂexicoking ). In all of these processes the simultaneous
formation of sediment or coke limits the conversion to usable liquid 
products (Speight, 1999; Speight and Ozum 2002 and references cited
therein).52 petroleum and petroleum products
Figure 2.2. Schematic of a petroleum reﬁnery (from Speight, 1999)2.3.1. Visbreaking
The visbreaking process is used primarily a means of reducing the viscos-
ity of heavy feedstocks by controlled thermal decomposition insofar as the
hot products are quenched before complete conversion can occur (Speight,
1999). However, the process is often plagued by sediment formation in the
products. This sediment, or sludge, must be removed if the products are to
meet fuel oil speciﬁcations.
The process (Fig. 2.3) uses the mild thermal cracking ( partial conversion )
as a relatively low-cost and low-severity approach to improving the viscos-
ity characteristics of the residue without attempting signiﬁcant conversion
to distillates. Low residence times are required to avoid polymerization and
coking reactions, although additives can help to suppress coke deposits on
the tubes of the furnace.
A visbreaking unit consists of a reaction furnace, followed by quenching
with a recycled oil, and fractionation of the product mixture.All of the reac-
tion in this process occurs as the oil ﬂows through the tubes of the reaction
furnace. The severity is controlled by the ﬂow rate through the furnace and
the temperature; typical conditions are 475–500°C (885–930°F) at the
furnace exit with a residence time of 1–3 minutes; operation for 3–6 months
on stream (continuous use) is possible before the furnace tubes must bepetroleum reﬁning 53
Figure 2.3. The visbreaking process cleaned and the coke removed. The operating pressure in the furnace tubes
can range from 0.7 to 5 MPa depending on the degree of vaporization and
the residence time desired. For a given furnace tube volume, a lower oper-
ating pressure will reduce the actual residence time of the liquid phase.
2.3.2. Coking
Coking , as the term is used in the petroleum industry, is a process for con-
verting nondistillable fractions (residua) of petroleum to lower-boiling
products and coke. Coking is often used in preference to catalytic cracking
because of the presence of metals and nitrogen components that poison 
catalysts (Speight and Ozum, 2002).
There are several coking processes: delayed coking ,ﬂuid coking , and 
ﬂexicoking as well as several other variations.
Delayed coking (Fig. 2.4) is the oldest, most widely used process and has
changed very little in the ﬁve or more decades in which it has been on
stream in reﬁneries.
In the semicontinuous process, the residuum or other heavy feedstock
is heated to the cracking/coking temperature ( >350°C/>660°F; but usually
at temperatures on the order of 480°C/895°F) and the hot liquid is
charged, usually by upﬂow, to the coke drum where the coking reactions
occur. Liquid and gaseous products pass to the fractionator for separa-
tion and coke deposits in the drum. The coke drums are arranged in pairs,
one on stream and the other off stream, and used alternately to allow54 petroleum and petroleum products
Figure 2.4. The delayed coking processcontinuous processing. The process can be operated on a cycle, typically
24–48 hours.
The overhead oil is fractionated into fuel gas (ethane and lower-
molecular-weight gases), propane-propylene, butane-butene, naphtha, light
gas oil, and heavy gas oil. Yields and product quality vary widely because
of the broad range of feedstock types charged to delayed coking. The 
function of the coke drum is to provide the residence time required for the
coking reactions and to accumulate the coke. Hydraulic cutters are used to
remove coke from the drum.
Fluid coking (Fig. 2.5) is a continuous ﬂuidized solids process that cracks
feed thermally over heated coke particles in a reactor vessel to gas, liquid
products, and coke. Heat for the process is supplied by partial combustion"
"of the coke, with the remaining coke being drawn as product. The new coke
is deposited in a thin, fresh layer on the outside surface of the circulating
coke particle.
Small particles of coke made in the process circulate in a ﬂuidized state
between the vessels and are the heat transfer medium. Thus the process
requires no high-temperature preheat furnace. Fluid coking is carried out
at essentially atmospheric pressure and temperatures in excess of 485°C
(900°F) with residence times on the order of 15–30 seconds. The longer 
residence time is in direct contrast to the delayed coking process, in which
the coking reactions are allowed to proceed to completion. This is evidentpetroleum reﬁning 55
Figure 2.5. The ﬂuid coking process from the somewhat higher liquid yields observed in many ﬂuid coking
processes. However, the products from a ﬂuid coker may be somewhat more
oleﬁnic and slightly less desirable for downstream processing. The ﬂexicok-
ingprocess is a modiﬁcation of the ﬂuid coking process that includes a gasi-
ﬁer adjoining the burner/regenerator to convert excess coke to a clean fuel
gas with a heating value of about 90 Btu/ft3. The coke gasiﬁcation can be
controlled to burn about 95% of the coke to maximize production of coke
gas or to operate at a reduced level to produce both gas and a coke. This
ﬂexibility permits adjustment for coke market conditions over a consider-
able range of feedstock properties.
The liquid products from the coker can, after cleanup via commercially
available hydrodesulfurization technology (Speight, 2001), provide low-
sulfur liquid fuels (less than 0.2% w/w sulfur). Coker naphtha has a boiling
range up to 220°C (430°F), are oleﬁnic, and must be upgraded by hydrogen
processing for removal of oleﬁns, sulfur, and nitrogen. They are then used
conventionally for reforming to gasoline or chemicals feedstock. Middle
distillates, boiling in the range of 220–360°C (430–680°F), are also hydro-
gen treated for improved storage stability, sulfur removal, and nitrogen
reduction. They can then be used as precursors to gasoline, diesel fuel, or
fuel oil. The gas oil boiling up to 510°C (950°F) is usually low in metals and
may be used as the feedstock for ﬂuid catalytic cracking.
Another major application for the coking processes is in upgrading
heavy (high viscosity), low-value petroleum into lighter products.
Petroleum coke is used principally as a fuel or, after calcining, for carbon
electrodes. The feedstock from which the coke is produced controls the
coke properties, especially sulfur, nitrogen, and metal content. A concen-
tration effect tends to deposit the majority of the sulfur, nitrogen, and
metals in the coke. Cokes exceeding about 2.5% sulfur content and 200 ppm
vanadium are mainly used, environmental regulations permitting, for fuel
or fuel additives. The properties of coke for non-fuel use include a low
sulfur, metal, and ash content as well as a deﬁnable physical structure.
2.3.3. Hydroprocessing
Hydroprocessing is the conversion of various feedstocks using the physical
aspects of temperature, residence time, and the presence of hydrogen under
pressure. Hydroprocessing is more conveniently subdivided into hydrotreat-
ingand hydrocracking .
Hydrotreating is deﬁned as the lower-temperature removal of hetero-
atomic species by treatment of a feedstock or product in the presence of
hydrogen. On the other hand, hydrocracking (Fig. 2.6) is the thermal
decomposition (in the presence of hydrogen) of a feedstock in which
carbon-carbon bonds are cleaved in addition to the removal of hetero-56 petroleum and petroleum productsatomic species (nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur) as the respective hydro-
genated analogs (ammonia, NH 3, water, H 2O, and hydrogen sulﬁde, H 2S).
In reality, hydrotreating and hydrocracking may occur simultaneously.
In contrast to the visbreaking process, in which the general principle is
the production of products for use as fuel oil, hydroprocessing is used to
produce a slate of products for use as liquid fuels.
2.4. NATURAL GAS
2.4.1. Deﬁnition
Natural gas is the gaseous mixture associated with petroleum reservoirs and
is predominantly methane but does contain other combustible hydro-
carbon compounds as well as non-hydrocarbon compounds (Table 2.3;
Speight, 1999). In fact, associated natural gas is believed to be the most eco-
nomical form of ethane.
The gas occurs in the porous rock of the earth’s crust either alone or with
accumulations of petroleum. In the latter case, the gas forms the gas cap,
which is the mass of gas trapped between the liquid petroleum and the
impervious cap rock of the petroleum reservoir. When the pressure in the
reservoir is sufﬁciently high, the natural gas may be dissolved in the petro-
leum and released on penetration of the reservoir as a result of drilling
operations.natural gas 57
Figure 2.6. The hydrocracking process The principal types of gaseous fuels are oil (distillation) gas, reformed"
"natural gas, and reformed propane or liqueﬁed petroleum gas (LPG). Mixed
gasis a gas prepared by adding natural gas or LPG to a manufactured gas,
giving a product of better utility and higher heat content or Btu value.
Liqueﬁed petroleum gas (LPG ) is the term applied to certain speciﬁc
hydrocarbons and their mixtures, which exist in the gaseous state under
atmospheric ambient conditions but can be converted to the liquid state
under conditions of moderate pressure at ambient temperature.
Thus LPG is a hydrocarbon mixture containing propane (CH 3CH 2CH 3),
butane (CH 3CH 2CH 2CH 3),iso-butane [CH 3CH(CH 3)CH 3] and to a lesser
extent propylene (CH 3CH:CH 2), or butylene (CH 3CH 2CH:CH 2). The most
common commercial products are propane, butane, or some mixture of the
two and are generally extracted from natural gas or crude petroleum.
Propylene and butylenes result from the cracking of other hydrocarbons in
a petroleum reﬁnery and are two important chemical feedstocks.
2.4.2. Composition 
The principal constituent of natural gas is methane (CH 4). Other con-
stituents are parafﬁnic hydrocarbons such as ethane (CH 3CH 3), propane,
and the butanes. Many natural gases contain nitrogen (N 2) as well as carbon
dioxide (CO 2) and hydrogen sulﬁde (H 2S).Trace quantities of argon, hydro-58 petroleum and petroleum products

a higher molecular weight than methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen
sulﬁde are removed from natural gas before its use as a fuel. Gases pro-
duced in a reﬁnery contain methane, ethane, ethylene, propylene, hydrogen,
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen, with low concentrations of
water vapor, oxygen, and other gases.
Types of natural gas vary according to composition. There is dry gas or
lean gas , which is mostly methane, and wet gas , which contains considerable
amounts of higher-molecular-weight and higher-boiling hydrocarbons
(Table 2.4). Sour gas contains high proportions of hydrogen sulﬁde, whereas
sweet gas contains little or no hydrogen sulﬁde. Residue gas is the gas
remaining (mostly methane) after the higher-molecular-weight parafﬁns
have been extracted). Casinghead gas is the gas derived from an oil well by
extraction at the surface. Natural gas has no distinct odor and its main use
is for fuel, but it can also be used to make chemicals and liqueﬁed petro-
leum gas.
Some natural gas wells also produce helium, which can occur in com-
mercial quantities; nitrogen and carbon dioxide are also found in some
natural gases. Gas is usually separated at as high a pressure as possible,
reducing compression costs when the gas is to be used for gas lift or de-natural gas 59

gen sulﬁde are removed as necessary to obtain a petroleum of suitable
vapor pressure for transport yet retaining most of the natural gasoline 
constituents.
In addition to composition and thermal content (Btu/scf, Btu/ft3), natural
gas can also be characterized on the basis of the mode of the natural gas
found in reservoirs where there is no or, at best only minimal amounts of,
petroleum.
Thus there is nonassociated natural gas, which is found in reservoirs in
which there is no, or at best only minimal amounts of, petroleum. Nonas-
sociated gas is usually richer in methane but is markedly leaner in terms of
the higher-molecular-weight hydrocarbons and condensate. Conversely,
there is also associated natural gas ( dissolved natural gas) that occurs either
as free gas or as gas in solution in the petroleum. The gas that occurs as a
solution with the crude petroleum is dissolved gas , whereas the gas that
exists in contact with the crude petroleum ( gas cap ) is associated gas . Asso-
ciated gas is usually leaner in methane than the nonassociated gas but is
richer in the higher-molecular-weight constituents."
"The most preferred type of natural gas is the nonassociated gas. Such gas
can be produced at high pressure, whereas associated or dissolved gas must
be separated from petroleum at lower separator pressures, which usually
involves increased expenditure for compression. Thus it is not surprising
that such gas (under conditions that are not economically favorable) is
often ﬂared or vented.
As with petroleum, natural gas from different wells varies widely in com-
position and analyses (Speight, 1990 and references cited therein; Speight,
1993 and references cited therein; Speight, 1999), and the proportion of non-
hydrocarbon constituents can vary over a very wide range. Thus a particu-
lar natural gas ﬁeld could require production, processing, and handling
protocols different from those used for gas from another ﬁeld.
The non-hydrocarbon constituents of natural gas can be classiﬁed as two
types of materials: (1) diluents, such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water
vapors, and (2) contaminants, such as hydrogen sulﬁde and/or other sulfur
compounds.
The diluents are noncombustible gases that reduce the heating value of
the gas and are on occasion used as ﬁllers when it is necessary to reduce
the heat content of the gas. On the other hand, the contaminants are detri-
mental to production and transportation equipment in addition to being
obnoxious pollutants. Thus the primary reason for gas reﬁning is to remove
the unwanted constituents of natural gas and to separate the gas into its
various constituents. The processes are analogous to the distillation unit in
a reﬁnery where the feedstock is separated into its various constituent frac-
tions before further processing to products.60 petroleum and petroleum productsThe major diluents or contaminants of natural gas are:
1. Acid gas, which is predominantly hydrogen sulﬁde, although carbon
dioxide does occur to a lesser extent;
2. Water,which includes all entrained free water or water in condensed forms;
3. Liquids in the gas, such as higher-boiling hydrocarbons as well as
pump lubricating oil, scrubber oil, and, on occasion, methanol; and 
4. Any solid matter that may be present, such as ﬁne silica (sand) and
scaling from the pipe.
2.4.3. Properties and Test Methods
The composition of natural and process gases can vary so widely that no
single set of speciﬁcations can possibly cover all of the tests necessary to
deﬁne the speciﬁcations. The requirements are usually based on perform-
ances in burners and equipment, on minimum heat content, and on
maximum sulfur content.
Because natural gas as delivered to pipelines has practically no odor , the
addition of an odorant is required by most regulations so that the presence
of the gas can be detected readily in case of accidents and leaks. This odor-
ization is provided by the addition of trace amounts of some organic sulfur
compounds to the gas before it reaches the consumer.The standard require-
ment is that a user will be able to detect the presence of the gas by odor
when the concentration reaches 1% of gas in air. Because the lower limit
of ﬂammability of natural gas is approximately 5%, this 1% requirement 
is essentially equivalent to one-ﬁfth the lower limit of ﬂammability. The
combustion of these trace amounts of odorant does not create any serious
problems of sulfur content or toxicity.
The different methods for measuring gas composition include absorption,
distillation, combustion, mass spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and gas
chromatography (ASTM D-2163, ASTM D-2650, and ASTM D-4424).
Absorption methods involve absorbing individual constituents one at a time
in suitable solvents and recording of contraction in volume measured. Dis-
tillation methods depend on the separation of constituents by fractional dis-
tillation and measurement of the volumes distilled. In combustion methods,
certain combustible elements are caused to burn to carbon dioxide and
water and the volume changes are used to calculate composition. Infrared
spectroscopy is useful in particular applications.For the most accurate analy-
ses, mass spectroscopy and gas chromatography are the preferred methods.
The speciﬁc gravity of product gases, including LPG, may be determined
conveniently by a number of methods and a variety of instruments (ASTM
D-1070, ASTM D-4891).natural gas 61The heat value of gases is generally determined at constant pressure in
a ﬂow calorimeter in which the heat released by the combustion of a deﬁ-
nite quantity of gas is absorbed by a measured quantity of water or air. A
continuous recording calorimeter is available for measuring heat values of
natural gases (ASTM D-1826).
The lower and upper limits of ﬂammability indicate the percentage of
combustible gas in air below which and above which ﬂame will not propa-
gate. When ﬂame is initiated in mixtures having compositions within these
limits it will propagate, and therefore the mixtures are ﬂammable.A knowl-"
"edge of ﬂammable limits and their use in establishing safe practices in 
handling gaseous fuels is important, for example, when purging equipment
used in gas service, in controlling factory or mine atmospheres, or in 
handling liqueﬁed gases.
Many factors enter into the experimental determination of ﬂammable
limits of gas mixtures, including the diameter and length of the tube or
vessel used for the test, the temperature and pressure of the gases, and the
direction of ﬂame propagation—upward or downward. For these and other
reasons, great care must be used in the application of the data. In moni-
toring closed spaces where small amounts of gases enter the atmosphere,
often the maximum concentration of the combustible gas is limited to one-
ﬁfth of the concentration of the gas at the lower limit of ﬂammability of the
gas-air mixture.
2.5. NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GASOLINE
Natural gas liquids are products other than methane from natural gas:
ethane, butane, iso-butane, and propane. Natural gasoline may also be
included in this group.
Natural gas liquids are, in fact, separate and distinct hydrocarbons con-
tained within some streams of natural gas. Streams that contain commer-
cial quantities of natural gas liquids are called wet gas , and those with little
or no liquids present are known as dry gas (see above).
Chemical manufacturers use ethane in making ethylene, an important
petrochemical. Butane and propane, and mixtures of the two, are classiﬁed
as liqueﬁed petroleum gas (LPG), which is used chieﬂy as a heating fuel in
industry and in homes. Pentane, hexane, and heptane are called natural
gasoline or condensate and are used for blending with reﬁnery gasoline.
The extraction of natural gas liquids from natural gas is achieved by the
application of reﬁning techniques that result in fractionation of the natural
gas into its hydrocarbon constituents. There are two main methods of pro-
ducing natural gas liquids: (1) condensation and (2) absorption . In conden-
sation, natural gas is chilled until it becomes a liquid from which the natural62 petroleum and petroleum productsgas liquids are extracted. In absorption, processors mix gas with an oil that
absorbs light hydrocarbons and the natural gas liquids are distilled from the
oil.
Another product is gas condensate , which contains relatively high
amounts of the higher-molecular-weight liquid hydrocarbons. These hydro-
carbons may occur in the gas phase in the reservoir.
Normally the gas in a gas cap contains methane and other hydrocarbons
that may be separated out by compressing the gas. A well-known example
is natural gasoline , which was formerly referred to as casinghead gasoline
or natural gas gasoline . However, at high pressures such as those existing in
the deeper ﬁelds, the density of the gas increases and the density of the oil
decreases until they form a single phase in the reservoir.
Wetnatural gas contains natural gasoline in vapor form.The wet gas, also
known as casinghead gas, is chieﬂy a mixture of methane, ethane, and the
volatile hydrocarbons propane, butane, pentane (C 5H12), hexane (C 6H14),
and heptane (C 7H16). The latter three hydrocarbons form the main con-
stituents of natural gasoline, which is recovered in reﬁneries in liquid form
mainly by absorption or compression processes. Pentane, hexane, and
heptane are liquids under normal atmospheric conditions and are the chief
components of ordinary reﬁnery gasoline.
Natural gasoline is used as blending stock for reﬁnery gasoline and may
be cracked to produce lower-boiling products, such as ethylene, propylene,
and butylene. Caution should be taken not to confuse natural gasoline with
straight-run gasoline (often also incorrectly referred to as natural gasoline),
which is the gasoline distilled unchanged from petroleum.
The various tests that are applied to speciﬁcations for this group of low-
boiling liquids will be referenced in the chapters dealing with liqueﬁed
petroleum gas (Chapter 3), naphtha (Chapter 4), and gasoline (Chapter 5).
2.6. PETROLEUM CHARACTER AND BEHA VIOR
The data derived from any one or more of the analytical techniques give
an indication of the characteristics of petroleum and an indication of the
methods of feedstock processing as well as for the predictability of product
yields and properties (Dolbear et al., 1987; Adler and Hall, 1988; Wallace
and Carrigy, 1988; Al-Besharah et al., 1989; Speight, 1999, 2000, 2001 and
references cited therein).
The most promising means of predictability of feedstock behavior during
processing and predictability of product yields and properties has arisen
from the concept of feedstock mapping (Speight, 2001). In such procedures,
properties of feedstock are mapped to show characteristics that are in visual
form rather than in tabular form. In this manner the visual characteristicspetroleum character and behavior 63of the feedstock are used to evaluate and predict the behavior of the feed-"
"stock in various reﬁning scenarios. Whether or not such methods will
replace the simpler form of property correlations remains to be determined.
It is more than likely that both will continue to be used in a complemen-
tary fashion for some time to come. However, there is also the need to 
recognize that what is adequate for one reﬁnery and one feedstock (or feed-
stock blend provided that the blend composition does not change signiﬁ-
cantly) will not be suitable for a different reﬁnery with a different feedstock
(or feedstock blend).
One of the most effective means of feedstock mapping has arisen though
the use of a multidisciplinary approach that involves use of all of the nec-
essary properties of a feedstock. However, it must be recognized that such
maps do not give any indication of the complex interactions that occur
between, for example, such fractions as the asphaltenes and resins (Koots
and Speight, 1975; Speight, 1994), but it does allow predictions of feedstock
behavior. It must also be recognized that such a representation varies for
different feedstocks.
More recent work related to feedstock mapping has involved the devel-
opment of a different type of compositional map using the molecular weight
distribution and the molecular type distribution as coordinates. Such a map
can provide insights into many separation and conversion processes used
in petroleum reﬁning (Speight, 2001).
Thus a feedstock map can be used to show where a particular physical
or chemical property tends to concentrate on the map. For example, the
coke-forming propensity, that is, the amount of the carbon residue, is shown
for various regions on the map for a sample of atmospheric residuum 
(Fig. 2.7; Long and Speight, 1998). In addition, a feedstock map can be very
useful for predicting the effectiveness of various types of separations pro-
cesses as applied to petroleum (Fig. 2.8; Speight, 2001).
In contrast to the cut lines generated by separation processes, conver-
sion processes move materials in the composition from one molecular type
to another. For example, reforming converts saturates to aromatics and
hydrogenation converts aromatic molecules to saturated molecules and
polar aromatic molecules to either aromatic molecules or saturated mole-
cules (Fig. 2.9; Speight, 2001). The processes illustrated are reforming,
hydrogenation, hydrotreating, hydrocracking, visbreaking, and heat soak-
ing. The arrows go from the material converted to what it is converted to.
Hydrotreating removes nitrogen and sulfur compounds from polar aro-
matics without much change in molecular weight. Hydrocracking converts
polar species to aromatics while at the same time reducing molecular
weight. Visbreaking and heat soaking primarily lower or raise the molecu-
lar weight of the polar species in the composition map. Thus visbreaking is
used to lower the viscosity of heavy oils, whereas heat soaking is a coking64 petroleum and petroleum productspetroleum character and behavior 65
Figure 2.7. Map for fractional separation of petroleum 
Figure 2.8. Separation processes from a petroleum map method. Thus conversion processes can change the shape and size of the
composition map.
Thus the data derived from any one or more of the analytical methods
described in this chapter can be combined to give an indication of the char-
acteristics of the feedstock as well as options for feedstock processing and
for the prediction of product properties.
Indeed, the use of physical properties for feedstock evaluation has con-
tinued in reﬁneries and in process research laboratories to the present time
and will continue for some time. It is, of course, a matter of choosing the
relevant and meaningful properties to meet the nature of the task. What is
certain is that the use of one single property cannot accurately portray the
character and behavior of petroleum.

3.1. INTRODUCTION
The terms petroleum gas and reﬁnery gas are often used to identify lique-
ﬁed petroleum gas (LPG) or even gas that emanates from the top of a reﬁn-
ery distillation column. For the purpose of this text, “petroleum gas” not
only describes liqueﬁed petroleum gas but also natural gas and reﬁnery gas
(Guthrie, 1967; Francis and Peters, 1980; Rawlinson and Ward, 1973;
Hoffman, 1983; Moustafa, 1996; Speight, 1999). In this chapter, each gas is,
in turn, referenced by its name rather than the generic term petroleum gas
(ASTM D-4150). However, the composition of each gas varies (Table 3.1)
and recognition of this is essential before testing protocols are applied.
The ﬁrst and most important aspect of gaseous testing is the measure-
ment of the volume of gas (ASTM D-1071). In this test method, several
techniques are described and may be employed for any purpose where it is
necessary to know the quantity of gaseous fuel. In addition, the thermo-
physical properties of methane (ASTM D-3956), ethane (ASTM D-3984),
propane (ASTM D-4362), n-butane (ASTM D-4650), and iso-butane
(ASTM D-4651) should be available for use and consultation (see also
Stephenson and Malanowski, 1987).
3.1.1. Liqueﬁed Petroleum Gas
Liqueﬁed petroleum gas (LPG) is a mixture of the gaseous hydrocarbons
propane (CH 3CH 2CH 3, boiling point: –42°C, –44°F) and butane
(CH 3CH 2CH 2CH 3, boiling point: 0°C, 32°F) that are produced during
natural gas reﬁning, petroleum stabilization, and petroleum reﬁning
(Austin, 1984; Speight, 1999; Ritter, 2000). The propane and butane can be
derived from natural gas or from reﬁnery operations, but in the latter case
substantial proportions of the corresponding oleﬁns will be present and
must be separated.The hydrocarbons are normally liqueﬁed under pressure
for transportation and storage.
The presence of propylene and butylenes in liqueﬁed petroleum gas 
used as fuel gas is not critical. The vapor pressures of these oleﬁns are
slightly higher than those of propane and butane and the ﬂame speed is
69substantially higher, but this may be an advantage because the ﬂame 
speeds of propane and butane are slow. However, one issue that often limits
the amount of oleﬁns in liqueﬁed petroleum gas is the propensity of the
oleﬁns to form soot.
In addition, liqueﬁed petroleum gas is usually available in different
grades (usually speciﬁed as Commercial Propane, Commercial Butane,
Commercial Propane-Butane (P-B) Mixtures, and Special Duty Propane)
(Rawlinson and Ward, 1973). During the use of liqueﬁed petroleum gas, the
gas must vaporize completely and burn satisfactorily in the appliance
without causing any corrosion or producing any deposits in the system.
Commercial Propane consists predominantly of propane and/or propy-
lene, whereas Commercial Butane is mainly composed of butanes and/or
butylenes. Both must be free from harmful amounts of toxic constituents
and free from mechanically entrained water (which may be further limited
by speciﬁcations) (ASTM D-1835). Analysis by gas chromatography is 
possible (IP 405).
Commercial Propane-Butane mixtures are produced to meet particular
requirements such as volatility, vapor pressure, speciﬁc gravity, hydrocar-
bon composition, sulfur and its compounds, corrosion of copper, residues,
and water content. These mixtures are used as fuels in areas and at times
where low ambient temperatures are less frequently encountered. Analysis
by gas chromatography is possible (ASTM D-5504, ASTM D-6228, IP 405).
Special Duty Propane is intended for use in spark-ignition engines,
and the speciﬁcation includes a minimum motor octane number to ensure70 gases

niﬁcantly lower octane number (ASTM D-2623) than propane, so there is
a limit to the amount of this component that can be tolerated in the mixture.
Analysis by gas chromatography is possible (ASTM D-5504, ASTM D-
6228, IP 405).
Liqueﬁed petroleum gas and liqueﬁed natural gas can share the facility
of being stored and transported as a liquid and then vaporized and used as
a gas.To achieve this, liqueﬁed petroleum gas must be maintained at a mod-
erate pressure but at ambient temperature. The liqueﬁed natural gas can be
at ambient pressure but must be maintained at a temperature of roughly
–1 to 60°C (30–140°F). In fact, in some applications it is actually economi-
cal and convenient to use liqueﬁed petroleum gas in the liquid phase. In
such cases, certain aspects of gas composition (or quality such as the ratio
of propane to butane and the presence of traces of heavier hydrocarbons,
water, and other extraneous materials) may be of lesser importance com-
pared with the use of the gas in the vapor phase.
For normal (gaseous) use, the contaminants of liqueﬁed petroleum gas
are controlled at a level at which they do not corrode ﬁttings and appli-
ances or impede the ﬂow of the gas. For example, hydrogen sulﬁde (H 2S)
and carbonyl sulﬁde (COS) should be absent. Organic sulfur to the level
required for adequate odorization (ASTM D-5305), or stenching , is a
normal requirement in liqueﬁed petroleum gas; dimethyl sulﬁde
(CH 3SCH 3) and ethyl mercaptan (C 2H5SH) are commonly used at a con-
centration of up to 50 ppm. Natural gas is similarly treated, possibly with a
wider range of volatile sulfur compounds.
The presence of water in liqueﬁed petroleum gas (or in natural gas) is
undesirable because it can produce hydrates that will cause, for example,
line blockage due to the formation of hydrates under conditions where the
water dew point is attained (ASTM D-1142). If the amount of water is
above acceptable levels, the addition of a small amount of methanol will
counteract any such effect.
In addition to other gases, liqueﬁed petroleum gas may also be contam-
inated by higher-boiling constituents such as the constituents of middle dis-
tillates to lubricating oil. These contaminants become included in the gas
during handling and must be prevented from reaching unacceptable levels.
Oleﬁns and especially dioleﬁns are prone to polymerization and should be
removed.
3.1.2. Natural Gas
Natural gas is found in petroleum reservoirs as free gas ( associated gas ),
in solution with petroleum in the reservoir ( dissolved gas ), or in reservoirs
that contain only gaseous constituents and no (or little) petroleum introduction 71(unassociated gas ) (Austin, 1984; Speight, 1999; Cranmore and Stanton,
2000).The hydrocarbon content varies from mixtures of methane and ethane
with very few other constituents ( drygas) to mixtures containing all of the
hydrocarbons from methane to pentane and even hexane (C 6H14) and
heptane (C 7H16) (wetgas). In both cases, some carbon dioxide (CO 2) and
inert gases, including helium (He), are present together with hydrogen
sulﬁde (H 2S) and a small quantity of organic sulfur.
Although the major subject of this chapter is liqueﬁed petroleum gas,
the term “petroleum gas(es)” in this context is also used to describe the
gaseous phase and liquid phase mixtures comprised mainly of methane 
to butane (C 1to C 4hydrocarbons) that are dissolved in the crude oil and
natural gas, as well as gases produced during thermal processes in which
the crude oil is converted to other products. It is necessary, however, to
acknowledge that in addition to the hydrocarbons, gases such as carbon
dioxide, hydrogen sulﬁde, and ammonia are also produced during petro-
leum reﬁning and will be constituents of reﬁnery gas that must be removed.
Oleﬁns are also present in the gas streams of various processes and are not
included in liqueﬁed petroleum gas but are removed for use in petro-
chemical operations (Crawford et al., 1993).
Raw natural gas varies greatly in composition (Table 3.2), and the 
constituents can be several of a group of hydrocarbons (Table 3.3) and 
non-hydrocarbons. The treatment required to prepare natural gas for 72 gases

Carbon dioxide (ASTM D-1137, ASTM D-1945, ASTM D-4984) in
excess of 3% is normally removed for reasons of corrosion prevention
(ASTM D-1838). Hydrogen sulﬁde (ASTM D-2420, ASTM D-2385, ASTM
D-2725, ASTM D-4084, ASTM D-4810, IP 103, IP 272) is also removed,
and the odor of the gases must not be objectionable (ASTM D-6273) so
mercaptan content (ASTM D-1988, ASTM D-2385, IP 272) is important.
A simple lead acetate test (ASTM D-2420, ASTM D-4084) is available
for detecting the presence of hydrogen sulﬁde and is an additional safe-
guard that hydrogen sulﬁde not be present (ASTM D-1835). Methyl mer-
captan, if present, produces a transitory yellow stain on the lead acetate
paper that fades completely in less than 5 min. Other sulfur compounds
(ASTM D-5504, ASTM D-6228) present in liqueﬁed petroleum gas do
not interfere.
In the lead acetate test (ASTM D-2420), the vaporized gas is passed over
moist lead acetate paper under controlled conditions. Hydrogen sulﬁde
reacts with lead acetate to form lead sulﬁde, resulting in a stain on the 
paper varying in color from yellow to black depending on the amount of
hydrogen sulﬁde present. Other pollutants can be determined by gas 
chromatography (ASTM D-5504, ASTM D-6228, IP 318).introduction 73

is normally acceptably low and frequently so low that it needs augmenting
by means of alkyl sulﬁdes, mercaptans, or thiophenes to maintain an accept-
able safe level of odor.
The hydrocarbon dew point is reduced to such a level that retrograde
condensation, that is, condensation resulting from pressure drop, cannot
occur under the worst conditions likely to be experienced in the gas trans-
mission system. Similarly, the water dew point is reduced to a level sufﬁ-
cient to preclude formation of C 1to C 4hydrates in the system.
The natural gas after appropriate treatment for acid gas reduction, odor-
ization, and hydrocarbon and moisture dew point adjustment (ASTM D-
1142) would then be sold within prescribed limits of pressure, caloriﬁc
value, and possibly Wobbe index [cv/(sp. gr.)].
3.1.3. Reﬁnery Gas
Reﬁnery gas is the noncondensable gas that is obtained during distillation
or treatment (cracking, thermal decomposition) of petroleum (Austin, 1984;
Speight, 1999; Robinson and Faulkner, 2000). It consists mainly of hydro-
gen (H 2), methane (CH 4), ethane (C 2H6), propane (C 3H8), butane (C 4H10),
and oleﬁns (RCH =CHR1, where R and R1can be hydrogen or a methyl
group) and may also include off-gases from petrochemical processes (Table
3-3). Oleﬁns such as ethylene (ethene, CH 2=CH 2, boiling point: –104°C,
–155°F), propene (propylene, CH 3CH=CH 2,boiling point: –47°C, –53°F),
butene (butene-1, CH 3CH 2CH=CH 2, boiling point: –5°C, 23°F) iso-butylene
[(CH 3)2C=CH 2, boiling point –6°C, 21°F], cis- and trans -butene-2 (CH 3CH=
CHCH 3, boiling point: ~1°C, 30°F), and butadiene (CH 2=CHCH=CH 2,
boiling point: –4°C, 24°F) as well as higher-boiling oleﬁns are produced by
various reﬁning processes.
In all cases, it is the composition of the gas in terms of hydrocarbon type
that is more important in the context of the application. For example, in
petrochemical applications, the presence of propylene and butylene above
10% v/v can have an adverse effect on hydrodesulfurization before steam
reforming. On the other hand, petrochemical processes, such as in the pro-
duction of iso-octane from iso-butane and butylene, can require the 
exclusion of the saturated hydrocarbons.
Reﬁnery gas speciﬁcations will vary according to the gas quality avail-
able and the end use (Rawlinson and Ward, 1973; Johansen, 1998). For fuel
uses, gas as speciﬁed above presents little difﬁculty when used as supplied.
Alternatively, a gas of constant Wobbe index, say for gas turbine use, could"
"readily be produced by the user. Part of the combustion air would be
diverted into the gas stream by a Wobbe index controller. This would be set
to supply gas at the lowest Wobbe index of the undiluted gas.74 gasesResidual reﬁnery gases, usually in more than one stream, which allows a
degree of quality control, are treated for hydrogen sulﬁde removal, and gas
sales are usually on a thermal content (caloriﬁc value, heating value) basis
with some adjustment for variation in the caloriﬁc value and hydrocarbon
type (Rawlinson and Ward, 1973; McKetta, 1993; Speight, 1993; Cranmore
and Stanton, 2000).
3.2. SAMPLING
One of the more critical aspects for the analysis of low-boiling hydrocar-
bons is the question of volumetric measurement (ASTM D-1071) and sam-
pling (ASTM D-1145, ASTM D-1247, ASTM D-1265). However, sampling
liqueﬁed petroleum gas from a liquid storage system is complicated by exis-
tence of two phases (gas and liquid), and the composition of the supernatant
vapor phase will, most probably, differ from the composition of the liquid
phase. Furthermore, the compositions of both phases will vary as a sample
(or sample) is removed from one or both phases.An accurate check of com-
position can only be made if samples are taken during ﬁlling of the tank or
from a fully charged tank.
In general, the sampling of gaseous constituents and of liqueﬁed gases is
the subject of a variety of sampling methods (ASTM D-5503), such as the
manual method (ASTM D-1265, ASTM D-4057), the ﬂoating piston cylin-
der method (ASTM D-3700), and the automatic sampling method (ASTM
D-4177,ASTM D-5287). Methods for the preparation of gaseous and liquid
blends are also available (ASTM D-4051, ASTM D-4307), including the
sampling and handling of fuels for volatility measurements (ASTM D-5842).
Sampling methane (CH 4) and ethane (C 2H6) hydrocarbons is usually
achieved using stainless steel cylinders, either lined or unlined. However,
other containers may also be used depending on particular situations. For
example, glass cylinder containers or polyvinyl ﬂuoride (PVF) sampling
bags may also be used but, obviously, cannot be subjected to pressures that
are far in excess of ambient pressure. The preferred method for sampling
propane (C 3H8) and butane (C 4H10) hydrocarbons is by the use of piston
cylinders (ASTM D-3700), although sampling these materials as gases is
also acceptable in many cases. The sampling of propane and higher-boiling
hydrocarbons is dependent upon the vapor pressure of the sample (IP 410).
Piston cylinders or pressurized steel cylinders are recommended for high-
vapor-pressure sampling where signiﬁcant amounts of low-boiling gases are
present, whereas atmospheric sampling may be used for samples having a
low vapor pressure.sampling 753.3. PROPERTIES AND TEST METHODS
Hydrocarbon gases are amenable to analytical techniques, and there has
been the tendency (and it remains) for the determination of both major
constituents and trace constituents more than is the case with the heavier
hydrocarbons.The complexity of the mixtures that are evident as the boiling
point of petroleum fractions and petroleum products increases makes iden-
tiﬁcation of many of the individual constituents difﬁcult, if not impossible.
In addition, methods have been developed for the determination of physi-
cal characteristics such as caloriﬁc value, speciﬁc gravity, and enthalpy from
the analyses of mixed hydrocarbon gases, but the accuracy does suffer when
compared with the data produced by methods for the direct determination
of these properties.
Bulk physical property tests, such as density and heating value, as well
as some compositional tests, such as the Orsat analysis and the mercuric
nitrate method for the determination of unsaturation, are still used.
However, the choice of a particular test rests on the decision of the
analyst that, in turn, depends on the nature of the gas under study. For
example, judgment by the analyst is necessary as to whether or not a test
that is applied to liqueﬁed petroleum gas is suitable for natural gas insofar
as inference from the non-hydrocarbon constituents will be minimal.
3.3.1. Caloriﬁc Value (Heat of Combustion)
Satisfactory combustion of hydrocarbon gases depends on the matching of
burner and appliance design with certain gas characteristics. Various types
of test methods are available for the direct determination of caloriﬁc value
(ASTM D-900, ASTM D-1826, ASTM D-3588, ASTM D-4981).
The most important of these are the Wobbe index [WI; or Wobbe number
=caloriﬁc value/(speciﬁc gravity] and the ﬂame speed, usually expressed as
a factor or an arbitrary scale on which the value of hydrogen is 100. This
factor can be calculated from the gas analysis. In fact, caloriﬁc value and spe-
ciﬁc gravity can be calculated from compositional analysis (ASTM D-3588).
The Wobbe number gives a measure of the heat input to an appliance
through a given aperture at a given gas pressure. By using this as a vertical"
"coordinate and the ﬂame speed factor (fsf) as the horizontal coordinate a
combustion diagram can be constructed for an appliance, or a whole range
of appliances, with the aid of appropriate test gases. This diagram shows the
area within which variations in the WI and fsf of gases may occur for the
given range of appliances without resulting in incomplete combustion,
ﬂame lift, or the lighting back of preaerated ﬂames. This method of predic-
tion of combustion characteristics is not sufﬁciently accurate to eliminate
entirely the need for the practical testing of new gases.76 gasesAnother important combustion criterion is the gas modulus, M =P/W,
where P is the gas pressure and W is the Wobbe number of the gas. This
must remain constant if a given degree of aeration is to be maintained in a
preaerated burner using air at atmospheric pressure.
3.3.2. Composition
Liqueﬁed petroleum gas, natural gas, and reﬁnery gas are mixtures of prod-
ucts or naturally occurring materials and, fortunately, are relatively simple
mixtures that do not suffer the complexities of the isomeric variations of
the higher-molecular-weight hydrocarbons (Table 3.4; Drews, 1998).
Thus, because of the lower-molecular-weight constituents of these gases
and their volatility, gas chromatography has been the technique of choice
for ﬁxed gas and hydrocarbon speciation and mass spectrometry is also a
method of choice for compositional analysis of low-molecular-weight
hydrocarbons (ASTM D-2421, ASTM D-2650). More recently, piggyback
methods (such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and other
double-technique methods) have been developed for the identiﬁcation of
gaseous and low-boiling liquid constituents of mixtures. The hydrocarbon
composition is limited as to the total amount of ethane, butane, or pentane
as well as ethylene and total dienes.
By limiting the amount of hydrocarbons that are lower boiling than the
main component, the vapor pressure control is reinforced. Tests are avail-properties and test methods 77

(45°C) (IP 161). The limitation on the amount of higher-boiling hydrocar-
bons supports the volatility clause. The vapor pressure and volatility spec-
iﬁcations will often be met automatically if the hydrocarbon composition is
correct.
The amount of ethylene is limited because it is necessary to restrict the
amount of unsaturated components so as to avoid the formation of deposits
caused by the polymerization of the oleﬁn(s). In addition, ethylene (boiling
point: –104°C, –155°F) is more volatile than ethane (boiling point: –88°C,
–127°F), and therefore a product with a substantial proportion of ethylene
will have a higher vapor pressure and volatility than one that is predomi-
nantly ethane. Butadiene is also undesirable because it may also produce
polymeric products that form deposits and cause blockage of lines.
Currently the preferred method for the analysis of liqueﬁed petroleum
gas, and indeed for most petroleum-related gases, is gas chromatography
(ASTM D-2163, IP 264). This technique can be used for the identiﬁcation
and measurement of both main constituents and trace constituents.
However, there may be some accuracy issues that arise in the measurement
of the higher-boiling constituents because of relative volatility under the
conditions in which the sample is held.
Capillary column gas chromatography is an even quicker and equally
accurate alternative. Mass spectrometry (ASTM D-1137) is also suitable for
analysis of petroleum gases. Of the other spectroscopic techniques, infrared
and ultraviolet absorption may be applied to petroleum gas analysis for
some specialized applications. Gas chromatography has also largely sup-
planted chemical absorption methods of analysis, but again these may have
some limited specialized application.
Once the composition of a mixture has been determined it is possible to
calculate various properties such as speciﬁc gravity, vapor pressure, caloriﬁc
value and dew point.
Simple evaporation tests in conjunction with vapor pressure measure-
ment give a further guide to composition. In these tests a liqueﬁed petro-
leum gas sample is allowed to evaporate naturally from an open graduated
vessel. Results are recorded on the basis of volume/temperature changes,
such as the temperature recorded when 95% has evaporated or the volume
left at a particular temperature (ASTM D-1837).
Because dew point can be calculated from composition, direct determi-
nation of dew point for a particular liqueﬁed petroleum gas sample is a
measure of composition. It is, of course, of more direct practical value and
if there are small quantities of higher-molecular-weight material present, it
is preferable to use a direct measurement."
"Speciﬁc gravity again can be calculated, but if it is necessary to measure
it several pieces of apparatus are available. For determining the density or78 gasesspeciﬁc gravity of liqueﬁed petroleum gas in its liquid state there are two
methods using a metal pressure pycnometer. A pressure hydrometer may
be used (ASTM D-1267) for the relative density that may also be calcu-
lated from composition al analysis (ASTM D-2598). Various procedures,
manual and recording, for speciﬁc gravity or density in the gaseous state
are given in two methods (ASTM D-l070, IP 59). Calculation of the density
is also possible using any one of four models, depending on the composi-
tion of the gas (ASTM D-4784).
Gases such as ethane that are destined for use as petrochemical feed-
stocks must adhere to stringent composition controls that are dependent
on the process. For example, moisture content (ASTM D-1142), oxygen
content (ASTM D-1945), carbon dioxide content (ASTM D-1945), and
sulfur content (ASTM D-1072) must be monitored because they all inter-
fere with catalyst performance in petrochemical processes.
The hydrocarbon composition of natural gasoline (although not speciﬁ-
cally a gas) for petrochemical use must undergo a compositional analysis
(ASTM D-2427) and a test for total sulfur (ASTM D-1266, IP 107, IP 191).
The presence of any component substantially less volatile than the main
constituents of the liqueﬁed petroleum gas will give rise to unsatisfactory
performance. It is difﬁcult to set limits for the amount and nature of the
“residue” that will make a product unsatisfactory. Obviously, small amounts
of oily material can block regulators and valves. In liquid vaporizer feed
systems even gasoline-type material could cause difﬁculty.
The residue (ASTM D-2158) is a measure of the concentration of con-
taminants boiling above 37.8°C (100°F) that may be present in the gas.
Determination of the residue by the end point index (EPI) endeavors to
give a measure of the heavier hydrocarbons, but the relationship between
EPI, hydrocarbon range, and performance is not established.
Other methods are available that measure residue more directly, and for
particular applications it may be possible to relate the values obtained to
the performance required and so to set satisfactory limits.
Analytical methods are available in standard form for determining
volatile sulfur content and certain speciﬁc corrosive sulfur compounds that
are likely to be present. Volatile sulfur determination is made by a com-
bustion procedure (ASTM D-l26, IP 107) that uses a modiﬁcation of the
standard wick-fed lamp. Many laboratories use rapid combustion tech-
niques with an oxy-hydrogen ﬂame in a Wickbold or Martin-Floret burner
(ASTM D-2784, IP 243).
This test method (ASTM D-2784, IP 243) is valid for sulfur levels of >1
mg/g of sulfur in liqueﬁed petroleum gas, but the samples should not contain
more than 100 mg/g of chlorine. In the test, the sample is burned in an oxy-
hydrogen burner or in a lamp in a closed system in a carbon dioxide-oxygen
atmosphere. The latter is not recommended for trace quantities of sulfurproperties and test methods 79because of the inordinately long combustion times needed. The sulfur
oxides produced are absorbed and oxidized to sulfuric acid in a hydrogen
peroxide solution. The sulfate ions are then determined by either titrating
with barium perchlorate solution and a thorinmethylene blue mixed indi-
cator or by precipitating as barium sulfate and measuring the turbidity of
the precipitate with a photometer.
Trace hydrocarbons that may be regarded as contaminants may be deter-
mined by the gas chromatographic methods already discussed. Heavier
hydrocarbons in small amounts may not be completely removed from the
column. If accurate information is required about the nature and amount
of heavy ends then temperature programming or a concentration proce-
dure may be used.
Analytical methods for determining traces of various other impurities,
such as chlorides (ASTM D-2384), are known to be in use. The presence of
acetylenes in reﬁnery gases, although unlikely, must still be considered.
Acetylenes can be determined with a chemical test method, whereas car-
bonyls are determined by the classic hydroxylamine hydrochloride reaction
(ASTM D-1089).
The determination of traces of higher-boiling hydrocarbons and oily
matter involves use of a method for residue that involves a preliminary
weathering. The residue after weathering is dissolved in a solvent, and the
solution is applied to a ﬁlter paper. The presence of residue is indicated by
the formation of an oil stain. The procedure is taken further by combining
the oil stain observation with other observed values to calculate an end
point index (ASTM D-2158). The method is not very precise, and work is
proceeding in several laboratories to develop a better method for the deter-
mination of residue in the form of oily matter."
"In liqueﬁed petroleum gas where the composition is such that the hydro-
carbon dew point is known to be low, a dew point method will detect the
presence of traces of water (ASTM D-1142).
The odor of liqueﬁed petroleum gas must be detectable to avoid the risk
of explosion. Odor is a very subjective matter, and no standard method is
available. It is desirable to set up some system in which the concentration
of gas can be measured in relation to its explosive limits and in which some
variables can be standardized, for example, ﬂow rate and oriﬁce size. This
will ensure that in any one location the liqueﬁed petroleum gas is always
being assessed under similar conditions from day to day.
Propane, iso-butane (boiling point: –12°C, 11°F), and butane generally
constitute this sample type and are used for heating and motor fuels and as
chemical feedstocks (ASTM D-2597, ASTM D-2504, ASTM D-2505).
Procedures for the determination of hydrogen, helium, oxygen, nitrogen,
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ethene, ethane, propane,
butanes, pentanes, and hexanes-plus in natural and reformed gases by80 gasespacked column gas chromatography are available (ASTM D-1945, ASTM
D-1946). These compositional analyses are used to calculate many other
properties of gases, such as density, heating value, and compressibility. The
ﬁrst ﬁve components listed are determined with a molecular sieve column
(argon carrier gas), whereas the remaining components are determined
with polydimethylsiloxane partition or porous polymer columns. The
hexanes-plus analysis is accomplished by backﬂushing the column after the
elution of pentane or by the use of a backﬂushed precolumn.
Important constituents of natural gas not accounted for in these analy-
ses are moisture (water) and hydrogen sulﬁde, as well as other sulfur com-
pounds (ASTM D-1142, ASTM D-1988, ASTM D-5454, ASTM D-4888,
ASTM D-5504, ASTM D-6228).
Oleﬁns (ethylene, propylene, butylenes, and pentylenes) that occur in
reﬁnery (process) gas have speciﬁc characteristics and require speciﬁc
testing protocols (ASTM D-5234, ASTM D-5273, ASTM D-5274).
Thus hydrocarbon analysis of ethylene is accomplished by two methods
(ASTM D-2505, ASTM D-6159), one of which (ASTM D-6159) uses wide-
bore (0.53 mm) capillary columns, including a Al 2O3/KCl PLOT column.
Another method (ASTM D-2504) is recommended for determination of
noncondensable gases, and yet another (ASTM D-2505) is used for the
determination of carbon dioxide.
Hydrocarbon impurities in propylene can be determined by gas chro-
matographic methods (ASTM D-2712, ASTM D-2163), and another test is
available for determination of traces of methanol in propylene (ASTM Test
Method D4864). A gas chromatographic method (ASTM D-5303) is avail-
able for the determination of trace amounts of carbonyl sulﬁde in propy-
lene with a ﬂame photometric detector. Also, sulfur in petroleum gas can
be determined by oxidative microcoulometry (ASTM D-3246).
Commercial butylenes, high-purity butylenes, and butane-butylene 
mixtures are analyzed for hydrocarbon constituents (ASTM D-4424), and
hydrocarbon impurities in 1,3-butadiene can also be determined by gas
chromatography (ASTM D-2593). The presence of butadiene dimer and
styrene is determined in butadiene by gas chromatography (ASTM 
D-2426).
Carbonyls in C 4hydrocarbons are determined by a titrimetric technique
(ASTM D-4423) and by use of a peroxide method (ASTM D-5799).
In general, gas chromatography will undoubtedly continue to be the
method of choice for characterization of light hydrocarbon materials. New
and improved detection devices and techniques, such as chemiluminescence,
atomic emission, and mass spectroscopy, will enhance selectivity, detection
limits, and analytical productivity. Laboratory automation through autosam-
pling, computer control, and data handling will provide improved precision
and productivity, as well as simpliﬁed method operation.properties and test methods 81Compositional analysis can be used to calculate caloriﬁc value, speciﬁc
gravity, and compressibility factor (ASTM D-3588).
Mercury in natural gas is also measured by atomic ﬂuorescence spec-
troscopy (ASTM D-6350) and by atomic absorption spectroscopy (ASTM
D-5954).
3.3.3. Density
The density of light hydrocarbons can be determined by several methods
(ASTM D-1070) including a hydrometer method (ASTM D-1298) and a
pressure hydrometer method (ASTM D-1657, IP 235). The speciﬁc gravity
(relative density) (ASTM D-1070, ASTM D-1657) by itself has little signiﬁ-
cance compared with its use for higher-molecular-weight liquid petroleum
products and can only give an indication of quality characteristics when
combined with values for volatility and vapor pressure. It is important for
stock quantity calculations and is used in connection with transport and
storage.
3.3.4. Sulfur
The manufacturing processes for liqueﬁed petroleum gas are designed so
that the majority, if not all, of the sulfur compounds are removed. The total"
"sulfur level is therefore considerably lower than for other petroleum fuels,
and a maximum limit for sulfur content helps to deﬁne the product more
completely.The sulfur compounds that are mainly responsible for corrosion
are hydrogen sulﬁde, carbonyl sulﬁde, and, sometimes, elemental sulfur.
Hydrogen sulﬁde and mercaptans have distinctive unpleasant odors.
Control of the total sulfur content, hydrogen sulﬁde, and mercaptans
ensures that the product is not corrosive or nauseating. Stipulating a satis-
factory copper strip test further ensures control of corrosion.
Total sulfur in gas can be determined by combustion (ASTM D-1072),
by the lamp method (ASTM D-1266), or by hydrogenation (ASTM D-3031,
ASTM D-4468). Trace total organic and bound nitrogen is determined
(ASTM D-4629). The current test method for heavy residues in liqueﬁed
petroleum gas (ASTM D-2158) involves evaporation of a liqueﬁed petro-
leum gas sample, measuring the volume of residue and observing the
residue for oil stain on a piece of ﬁlter paper.
Corrosive sulfur compounds can be detected by their effect on copper
and the form in which the general copper strip corrosion test (ASTM D-
l838) for petroleum products is applied to liqueﬁed petroleum gas. Hydro-
gen sulﬁde can be detected by its action on moist lead acetate paper, and
a procedure is also used as a measure of sulfur compounds. The method
follows the principle of the standard Doctor test.82 gases3.3.5. Volatility and Vapor Pressure
The vaporization and combustion characteristics of liqueﬁed petroleum gas
are deﬁned for normal applications by volatility, vapor pressure, and, to a
lesser extent, speciﬁc gravity.
Volatility is expressed in terms of the temperature at which 95% of the
sample is evaporated and presents a measure of the least volatile component
present (ASTM D-1837).Vapor pressure (IP 410) is, therefore, a measure of
the most extreme low-temperature conditions under which initial vaporiza-
tion can take place. By setting limits on vapor pressure and volatility jointly
the speciﬁcation serves to ensure essentially single-component products for
the butane and propane grades (ASTM D-1267, ASTM D-2598, IP 410). By
combining vapor pressure/volatility limits with speciﬁc gravity for propane-
butane mixtures, essentially two-component systems are ensured.
The residue (ASTM D-1025, ASTM D-2158, IP 317), that is, nonvolatile
matter, is a measure of the concentration of contaminants boiling above
37.8°C (100°F) that may be present in the gas.
For natural gasoline, the primary criteria are volatility (vapor pressure)
and knock performance. Determination of the vapor pressure (ASTM D-
323, ASTM D-4953, ASTM D-5190, ASTM D-5191) and distillation proﬁle
(ASTM D-216, IP 191) is essential. Knock performance is determined by
rating in knock test engines by both the motor method (ASTM D-2700, IP
236) and the research method (ATSM-2699, IP 237). The knock character-
istics of liqueﬁed petroleum gases can also be determined (IP 238).
Other considerations for natural gasoline are copper corrosion (ASTM
D-130, IP 154, IP 411) and speciﬁc gravity (ASTM D-1298, IP 160), the latter
determination being necessary for measurement and transportation.
3.3.6. Water
It is a fundamental requirement that liqueﬁed petroleum gas should not
contain free water (ASTM D-2713). Dissolved water may give trouble by
forming hydrates and giving moisture vapor in the gas phase. Both of these
will lead to blockages. Therefore, test methods are available to determine
the presence of water using electronic moisture analyzers (ASTM D-5454),
dew-point temperature (ASTM D-1142), and length-of-stain detector tubes
(ASTM D-4888).

NAPHTHA
4.1. INTRODUCTION
Naphtha is a liquid petroleum product that boils from about 30°C (86°F)
to approximately 200°C (392°F), although there are different grades of
naphtha within this extensive boiling range that have different boiling
ranges (Guthrie, 1967; Goodfellow, 1973; Weissermel and Arpe, 1978;
Francis and Peters, 1980; Hoffman, 1983; Austin, 1984; Chenier, 1992;
Speight, 1999; Hori, 2000). The term petroleum solvent is often used syn-
onymously with naphtha .
On a chemical basis, naphtha is difﬁcult to deﬁne precisely because it
can contain varying amounts of its constituents (parafﬁns, naphthenes, aro-
matics, and oleﬁns) in different proportions, in addition to the potential
isomers of the parafﬁns that exist in the naphtha boiling range (Tables 4.1
and 4.2). Naphtha is also represented as having a boiling range and carbon
number similar to those of gasoline (Fig. 4.1), being a precursor to 
gasoline.
The so-called petroleum ether solvents are speciﬁc-boiling-range naphtha
as is ligroin . Thus the term petroleum solvent describes special liquid hydro-
carbon fractions obtained from naphtha and used in industrial processes
and formulations (Weissermel and Arpe, 1978). These fractions are also
referred to as industrial naphtha . Other solvents include white spirit ,
which is subdivided into industrial spirit [distilling between 30°C and 200°C
(86°F–392°F)] and white spirit [light oil with a distillation range of 135°C–
200°C (275°F–392°F)]. The special value of naphtha as a solvent lies in its
stability and purity.
In this chapter, references to the various test methods dedicated to 
the determination of the amounts of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen
(ASTM D-5291) as well as the determination of oxygen, sulfur, metals,
and elements such as chlorine (ASTM D-808) are not included. Such 
tests might be deemed necessary but, in light of the various tests avail-
able for composition, are presumed to be at the discretion of the analyst.
References to the various test methods are presented elsewhere 
(Chapter 2).
854.2. PRODUCTION AND PROPERTIES
Naphtha is produced by any one of several methods, which include (1) frac-
tionation of straight-run, cracked, and reforming distillates or even frac-
tionation of crude petroleum; (2) solvent extraction; (3) hydrogenation of86 naphtha

and (5) alkylation processes. In fact, naphtha may be a combination of
product streams from more than one of these processes.
The more common method of naphtha preparation is distillation.
Depending on the design of the distillation unit, either one or two naphtha
steams may be produced: (1) a single naphtha with an end point of about"
"205∞C (400∞F) and similar to straight-run gasoline or (2) this same fraction
divided into a light naphtha and a heavy naphtha.The end point of the light
naphtha is varied to suit the subsequent subdivision of the naphtha into
narrower boiling fractions and may be of the order of 120 ∞C (250∞F).
Sulfur compounds are most commonly removed or converted to a harm-
less form by chemical treatment with lye, Doctor solution, copper chloride,production and properties 87
Figure 4.1. Boiling point and carbon number for various hydrocarbons and petroleum products or similar treating agents (Speight, 1999). Hydroreﬁning processes (Speight,
1999) are also often used in place of chemical treatment. When used as a
solvent, naphtha is selected for low sulfur content, and the usual treatment
processes remove only sulfur compounds. Naphtha with a small aromatic
content has a slight odor, but the aromatics increase the solvent power of
the naphtha and there is no need to remove aromatics unless odor-free
naphtha is speciﬁed.
The variety of applications emphasizes the versatility of naphtha. For
example, naphtha is used by paint, printing ink and polish manufacturers
and in the rubber and adhesive industries as well as in the preparation 
of edible oils, perfumes, glues, and fats. Further uses are found in the dry-
cleaning, leather, and fur industries and also in the pesticide ﬁeld. The 
characteristics that determine the suitability of naphtha for a particular 
use are volatility, solvent properties (dissolving power), purity, and odor
(generally, the lack thereof).
To meet the demands of a variety of uses, certain basic naphtha grades are
produced that are identiﬁed by boiling range.The complete range of naphtha
solvents may be divided, for convenience, into four general categories:
1. Special boiling point spirits having overall distillation range within the
limits of 30–165°C (86–329°F);
2. Pure aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, xylenes, or 
mixtures (BTX) thereof;
3. White spirit, also known as mineral spirit and naphtha, usually boiling
within 150–210°C (302–410°F);
4. High-boiling petroleum fractions boiling within the limits of 160–
325°C (320–617°F).
Because the end use dictates the required composition of naphtha, most
grades are available in both high- and low-solvency categories and the
various text methods can have major signiﬁcance in some applications and
lesser signiﬁcance in others. Hence the application and signiﬁcance of tests
must be considered in the light of the proposed end use.
Odor is particularly important because, unlike most other petroleum
liquids, many of the manufactured products containing naphtha are used in
conﬁned spaces, in factory workshops, and in the home.
4.3. TEST METHODS
Because of the high standards set for naphtha (McCann, 1998) it is essen-
tial to employ the correct techniques when taking samples for testing88 naphtha(ASTM D-270, ASTM D-4057, IP 51). Mishandling, or the slightest trace of
contaminant, can give rise to misleading results. Special care is necessary to
ensure that containers are scrupulously clean and free from odor. Samples
should be taken with the minimum of disturbance so as to avoid loss of
volatile components; in the case of low-boiling naphtha it may be necessary
to chill the sample.And, while awaiting examination samples should be kept
in a cool dark place so as to ensure that they do not lose volatile constituents
or discolor and develop odors because of oxidation.
The physical properties of naphtha depend on the hydrocarbon types
present, in general the aromatic hydrocarbons having the highest solvent
power and the straight-chain aliphatic compounds the lowest. The solvent
properties can be assessed by estimating the amount of the various hydro-
carbon types present. This method provides an indication of the solvent
power of the naphtha on the basis that aromatic constituents and naph-
thenic constituents provide dissolving ability that parafﬁnic constituents
do not. Another method for assessing the solvent properties of naphtha
measures the performance of the fraction when used as a solvent under
speciﬁed conditions such as, for example, by the kauri-butanol test method
(ASTM D-l133). Another method involves measurement of the surface
tension from which the solubility parameter is calculated and then pro-
vides an indication of dissolving power and compatibility. Such calcula-
tions have been used to determine the yield of asphaltenes from petroleum
by use of various solvents (Mitchell and Speight, 1973; Speight, 1999;
Speight, 2001). A similar principle is applied to determine the amount of
insoluble material in lubricating oil using n-pentane (ASTM D-893, ASTM
D-4055).
Insoluble constituents in lubricating oil can cause wear that can lead to
equipment failure. Pentane-insoluble materials can include oil-insoluble
materials and some oil-insoluble resinous matter originating from oil or"
"additive degradation or both. Toluene-insoluble constituents arise from
external contamination, fuel carbon, and highly carbonized materials from
degradation of fuel, oil, and additives or engine wear and corrosion mate-
rials.A signiﬁcant change in pentane- or toluene-insoluble constituents indi-
cates a change in oil properties that could lead to machinery failure. The
insoluble constituents measured can also assist in evaluating the perform-
ance characteristics of a used oil or in determining the cause of equipment
failure.
Thus one test (ASTM D-893) covers the determination of pentane-
and toluene-insoluble constituents in used lubricating oils with pentane
dilution and centrifugation as the method of separation. The other 
test (ASTM D-4055) uses pentane dilution followed by membrane ﬁltra-
tion to remove insoluble constituents that have a size greater than 
0.8 mm.test methods 894.3.1. Aniline Point and Mixed Aniline Point
The test method for the determination of aniline point and mixed aniline
point of hydrocarbon solvents (ASTM D-611, IP 2) is a means for deter-
mining the solvent power of naphtha by estimating of the relative amounts
of the various hydrocarbon constituents. It is a more precise technique than
the method for kauri-butanol number (ASTM D-1133).
The aniline (or mixed aniline) (ASTM D-611, IP 2) point helps in char-
acterization of pure hydrocarbons and in their mixtures and is most often
used to estimate the aromatic content of naphtha. Aromatic compounds
exhibit the lowest aniline points and parafﬁn compounds have the highest
aniline points, with cycloparafﬁns (naphthenes) and oleﬁns having aniline
points between the two extremes. In any homologous series the aniline
point increases with increasing molecular weight.
There are ﬁve submethods in the test (ASTM D-611, IP 2) for the deter-
mination of the aniline point: (1) Method A is used for transparent samples
with an initial boiling point above room temperature and where the aniline
point is below the bubble point and above the solidiﬁcation point of the
aniline-sample mixture; (2) method B, a thin-ﬁlm method, is suitable for
samples too dark for testing by method A; (3) methods C and D are used
when there is the potential for sample vaporization at the aniline point; (4)
method D is particularly suitable where only small quantities of sample are
available; and (5) method E uses an automatic apparatus suitable for the
range covered by methods A and B.
The results obtained by the kauri-butanol test (ASTM D-1133) depend
on factors other than solvent power and are speciﬁc to the solute employed.
For this reason, the aniline point is often preferred to the kauri-butanol
number.
4.3.2. Composition
The number of potential hydrocarbon isomers in the naphtha boiling range
(Tables 4.1 and 4.2) renders complete speciation of individual hydrocarbons
impossible for the naphtha distillation range, and methods are used that
identify the hydrocarbon types as chemical groups rather than as individ-
ual constituents.
The data from the density (speciﬁc gravity) test method (ASTM D-1298,
IP 160) provides a means of identiﬁcation of a grade of naphtha but is not
a guarantee of composition and can only be used to indicate evaluate
product composition or quality when used in conjunction with the data
from other test methods. Density data are used primarily to convert
naphtha volume to a weight basis, a requirement in many of the industries
concerned. For the necessary temperature corrections and also for volume90 naphthacorrections the appropriate sections of the petroleum measurement tables
(ASTM D-l250, IP 200) are used.
The ﬁrst level of compositional information is group-type totals as
deduced by adsorption chromatography (ASTM D-1319, IP 156) to give
volume percentage of saturates, oleﬁns, and aromatics in materials that boil
below 315°C (600°F).
In this test method, a small amount of sample is introduced into a glass
adsorption column packed with activated silica gel, of which a small layer
contains a mixture of ﬂuorescent dyes. When the sample has been adsorbed
on the gel, alcohol is added to desorb the sample down the column and the
hydrocarbon constituents are separated according to their afﬁnities into
three types (aromatics, oleﬁns, and saturates). The ﬂuorescent dyes also
react selectively with the hydrocarbon types and make the boundary zones
visible under ultraviolet light. The volume percentage of each hydrocarbon
type is calculated from the length of each zone in the column.
Other test methods are available. Content of benzene and other aro-
matics may be estimated by spectrophotometric analysis (ASTM D-1017)
and also by gas-liquid chromatography (ASTM D-2267, ASTM D-2600, IP
262). However, two test methods based on the adsorption concept (ASTM
D-2007,ASTM D-2549) are used for classifying oil samples of initial boiling
point of at least 200°C (392°F) into the hydrocarbon types of polar com-"
"pounds, aromatics, and saturates and recovery of representative fractions
of these types. Such methods are unsuitable for the majority of naphtha
samples because of volatility constraints.
An indication of naphtha composition may also be obtained from the
determination of aniline point (ASTM D-1012, IP 2), freezing point (ASTM
D-852, ASTM D-1015, ASTM D-1493) (Fig. 4.2), cloud point (ASTM D-
2500) (Fig. 4.3), and solidiﬁcation point (ASTM D-1493). And, although
reﬁnery treatment should ensure no alkalinity and acidity (ASTM D-847,
ASTM D-1093,ASTM D-1613,ASTM D-2896, IP 1) and no oleﬁns present,
the relevant tests using bromine number (ASTM D-875, ASTM D-1159, IP
130), bromine index (ASTM D-2710), and ﬂame ionization absorption
(ASTM D-1319, IP 156) are necessary to ensure low levels (at the
maximum) of hydrogen sulﬁde (ASTM D-853) as well as the sulfur com-
pounds in general (ASTM D-l30, ASTM D-849, ASTM D-1266, ASTM D-
2324, ASTM D-3120, ASTM D-4045, ASTM D-6212, IP 107, IP 154) and
especially corrosive sulfur compounds such as are determined by the
Doctor test method (ASTM D-4952, IP 30).
Aromatic content is a key property of low-boiling distillates such as
naphtha and gasoline because the aromatic constituents inﬂuence a variety
of properties including boiling range (ASTM D-86, IP 123), viscosity
(ASTM D-88,ASTM D-445,ASTM D-2161, IP 71), stability (ASTM D-525,
IP 40), and compatibility (ASTM D-1133) with a variety of solutes.test methods 91Existing methods use physical measurements and require suitable stan-
dards.Tests such as aniline point (ASTM D-611) and kauri-butanol number
(ASTM D-1133) are of a somewhat empirical nature and can serve a useful
function as control tests. Naphtha composition, however, is monitored
mainly by gas chromatography, and although most of the methods may have
been developed for gasoline (ASTM D-2427, ASTM D-6296), the applica-
bility of the methods to naphtha is sound.
A multidimensional gas chromatographic method (ASTM D-5443) 
provides for the determination of parafﬁns, naphthenes, and aromatics by
carbon number in low oleﬁnic hydrocarbon streams having ﬁnal boiling
points lower than 200°C (392°F). In this method, the sample is injected into
a gas chromatographic system that contains a series of columns and switch-
ing values. First a polar column retains polar aromatic compounds, binaph-
thenes, and high-boiling parafﬁns and naphthenes. The eluant from this
column goes through a platinum column that hydrogenates oleﬁns and then
to a molecular sieve column that performs a carbon number separation
based on the molecular structure, that is, naphthenes and parafﬁns.The frac-
tion remaining on the polar column is further divided into three separate92 naphtha

benzene test fractions that are then separated on a nonpolar column by boiling point. A
ﬂame ionization detector detects eluting compounds.
In another method (ASTM D-4420) for the determination of the amount
of aromatic constituents, a two-column chromatographic system connected
to a dual-ﬁlament thermal conductivity detector (or two single-ﬁlament
detectors) is used.The sample is injected into the column containing a polar
liquid phase. The nonaromatics are directed to the reference side of the
detector and vented to the atmosphere as they elute. The column is back-
ﬂushed immediately before the elution of benzene, and the aromatic
portion is directed into the second column containing a nonpolar liquid
phase. The aromatic components elute in the order of their boiling points
and are detected on the analytical side of the detector. Quantitation is
achieved by utilizing peak factors obtained from the analysis of a sample
having a known aromatic content.
Other methods for the determination of aromatics in naphtha include a
method (ASTM D-5580) using a ﬂame ionization detector and methods intest methods 93

spectroscopy (GC-FTIR) (ASTM D-5986) and gas chromatography and
mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (ASTM D-5769) is used.
Hydrocarbon composition is also determined by mass spectrometry—a
technique that has seen wide use for hydrocarbon-type analysis of naphtha
and gasoline (ASTM D-2789) as well as  identiﬁcation of hydrocarbon con-
stituents in higher-boiling naphtha fractions (ASTM D-2425).
One method (ASTM D-6379, IP 436) is used to determine the monoaro-
matic and diaromatic hydrocarbon contents in distillates boiling in the
range from 50 to 300°C (122–572°F). In this method the sample is diluted
with an equal volume of hydrocarbon, such as heptane, and a ﬁxed volume
of this solution is injected into a high-performance liquid chromatograph
ﬁtted with a polar column where separation of the aromatic hydrocarbons"
"from the nonaromatic hydrocarbons occurs. The separation of the aromatic
constituents appears as distinct bands according to ring structure, and a
refractive index detector is used to identify the components as they elute
from the column.The peak areas of the aromatic constituents are compared
with those obtained from previously run calibration standards to calculate
the % w/w monoaromatic hydrocarbon constituents and diaromatic hydro-
carbon constituents in the sample.
Compounds containing sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen could possibly inter-
fere with the performance of the test. Monoalkenes do not interfere, but
conjugated di- and polyalkenes, if present, may interfere with the test 
performance.
Another method (ASTM D-2425) provides more compositional detail
(in terms of molecular species) than chromatographic analysis, and the
hydrocarbon types are classiﬁed in terms of a Z-series in which Z (in the
empirical formula C nH2n+Z) is a measure of the hydrogen deﬁciency of 
the compound. This method requires that the sample be separated into 
saturate and aromatic fractions before mass spectrometric analysis (ASTM
D-2549), and the separation is applicable to some fractions but not others.
For example, the method is applicable to high-boiling naphtha but not to
low-boiling naphtha because it is impossible to evaporate the solvent used
in the separation without also losing the lower-boiling constituents of the
naphtha under investigation.
The percentage of aromatic hydrogen atoms and aromatic carbon atoms
can be determined by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spec-
troscopy (ASTM D-5292) that gives the mole percent of aromatic hydro-
gen or carbon atoms. Proton (hydrogen) magnetic resonance spectra are
obtained on sample solutions in either chloroform or carbon tetrachloride
with a continuous wave or pulse Fourier transform high-resolution mag-
netic resonance spectrometer. Carbon magnetic resonance spectra are94 naphthaobtained on the sample solution in chloroform- dwith a pulse Fourier trans-
form high-resolution magnetic resonance.
The data obtained by this method (ASTM D-5292) can be used to eval-
uate changes in aromatic contents in naphtha as well as kerosene, gas oil,
mineral oil, and lubricating oil. However, results from this test are not
equivalent to mass- or volume-percent aromatics determined by the chro-
matographic methods because the chromatographic methods determine the
percent by weight or percent by volume of molecules that have one or more
aromatic rings and alkyl substituents on the rings will contribute to the 
percentage of aromatics determined by chromatographic techniques.
Low-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can also be
used to determine percent by weight hydrogen in jet fuel (ASTM D-3701)
and in light distillate, middle distillate, and gas oil (ASTM D-4808). As
noted above, chromatographic methods are not applicable to naphtha
where losses can occur by evaporation.
The nature of the uses found for naphtha demands compatibility with
the many other materials employed in formulation, waxes, pigments, resins,
etc.; thus the solvent properties of a given fraction must be carefully meas-
ured and controlled. For most purposes volatility is important, and, because
of the wide use of naphtha in industrial and recovery plants, information
on some other fundamental characteristics is required for plant design.
Although the focus of many tests is analysis of the hydrocarbon 
constituents of naphtha and other petroleum fractions, heteroatoms 
compounds that contain sulfur and nitrogen atoms cannot be ignored 
and methods for their determination are available. The combination of gas
chromatography with element-selective detection gives information about
the distribution of the element. In addition, many individual heteroatomic
compounds can be determined.
Nitrogen compounds in middle distillates can be selectively detected by
chemiluminescence. Individual nitrogen compounds can be detected down
to 100 ppb nitrogen. Gas chromatography with either sulfur chemilumi-
nescence detection or atomic emission detection has been used for sulfur
selective detection.
Estimates of the purity of these products are determined in laboratories
with a variety of procedures such as freezing point, ﬂame ionization
absorbance, ultraviolet absorbance, gas chromatography, and capillary gas
chromatography (ASTM D-850, ASTM D-852, ASTM D-853, ASTM D-
848, ASTM D-849, ASTM D-1015, ASTM D-1016, ASTM D-1078, ASTM
D-1319, ASTM D-2008, ASTM D-22368, ASTM D-2306, ASTM D-2360,
ASTM D-5917, IP 156).
Gas chromatography (GC) has become a primary technique for deter-
mining hydrocarbon impurities in individual aromatic hydrocarbons andtest methods 95the composition of mixed aromatic hydrocarbons. Although a measure of
purity by gas chromatography is often sufﬁcient, gas chromatography is not
capable of measuring absolute purity; not all possible impurities will pass"
"through the gas chromatography column, and not all those that do will be
measured by the detector. Despite some shortcomings, gas chromatography
is a standard, widely used technique and is the basis of many current test
methods for aromatic hydrocarbons (ASTM D-2306 ASTM D-2360,ASTM
D-3054, ASTM D-3750, ASTM D-3797, ASTM D-3798, ASTM D-4492,
ASTM D-4534, ASTM D-4735, ASTM D-5060, ASTM D-5135, ASTM D-
5713, ASTM D-5917, ASTM D-6144).
When classes of hydrocarbons, such as oleﬁns, need to be measured, tech-
niques such as bromine index are used (ASTM D-1492, ASTM D-5776).
Impurities other than hydrocarbons are of concern in the petroleum
industry. For example, many catalytic processes are sensitive to sulfur con-
taminants. Consequently, there is also a series of methods to determine
trace concentrations of sulfur-containing compounds (ASTM D-1685,
ASTM D-3961, ASTM D-4045, ASTM D-4735).
Chloride-containing impurities are determined by various test methods
(ASTM D-5194, ASTM D-5808, ASTM D-6069) that have sensitivity to 1
mg/kg, reﬂecting the needs of industry to determine very low levels of these
contaminants.
Water is a contaminant in naphtha and should be measured using the
Karl Fischer method (ASTM E-203, ASTM D-1364, ASTM D-1744, ASTM
D-4377, ASTM D-4928, ASTM D-6304), by distillation (ASTM D-4006), or
by centrifugation (ASTM D-96) and excluded by relevant drying methods.
Tests should also be carried out for sediment if the naphtha has been
subjected to events (such as oxidation) that could lead to sediment forma-
tion and instability of the naphtha and the resulting products. Test methods
are available for the determination of sediment by extraction (ASTM 
D-473, IP 285) or by membrane ﬁltration (ASTM D-4807, IP 286) and the
determination of sediment simultaneously with water by centrifugation
(ASTM D-96, ASTM D-1796, ASTM D-2709, ASTM D-4007, IP 373, IP
374).
4.3.3. Correlative Methods
Correlative methods have long been used as a way of dealing with the com-
plexity of various petroleum fractions, including naphtha. Relatively easy
to measure physical properties such as density (or speciﬁc gravity) (ASTM
D-2935 ASTM D-3505, ASTM D-4052) are also required. Viscosity (ASTM
D-88, ASTM D-445, ASTM D-2161, IP 71), density (ASTM D-287,
ASTM D-891, ASTM D-941, ASTM D-1217, ASTM D-1298, ASTM D-
1555,ASTM D-1657,ASTM D-2935,ASTM D-4052,ASTM D-5002, IP 160,96 naphthaIP 235, IP 365), and refractive index (ASTM D-1218) have been correlated
to hydrocarbon composition (Tables 4.3 and 4.4).
4.3.4. Density (Speciﬁc Gravity)
Density (the mass of liquid per unit volume at 15°C) and the related 
terms speciﬁc gravity (the ratio of the mass of a given volume of liquid at
15°C to the mass of an equal volume of pure water at the same tempera-
ture) and relative density (same as speciﬁc gravity ) are important proper-
ties of petroleum products as they are a part of product sales speciﬁcations,
although they only play a minor role in studies of product composition.
Usually a hydrometer, pycnometer, or digital density meter is used for the
determination in all these standards.
The determination of density (speciﬁc gravity) (ASTM D-287,ASTM D-
891, ASTM D-941, ASTM D-1217, ASTM D-1298, ASTM D-1555, ASTM
D-1657, ASTM D-2935, ASTM D-4052, ASTM D-5002, IP 160, IP 235, IP
365) (Fig. 4.4) provides a check on the uniformity of the naphtha and
permits calculation of the weight per gallon. The temperature at which thetest methods 97

should also be known (ASTM D-1086). However, the methods are subject
to vapor pressure constraints and are used with appropriate precautions to
prevent vapor loss during sample handling and density measurement. In
addition, some test methods should not be applied if the samples are so
dark in color that the absence of air bubbles in the sample cell cannot be
established with certainty. The presence of such bubbles can have serious
consequences for the reliability of the test data.
4.3.5. Evaporation Rate
The evaporation rate is an important property of naphtha, and although
there is a signiﬁcant relation between distillation range and evaporation
rate, the relationship is not straightforward.
A simple procedure for determining the evaporation rate involves use
of at least a pair of tared shallow containers, each containing a weighed"
"amount of naphtha. The cover-free containers are placed in a temperature-
and humidity-controlled draft-free area. The containers are reweighed at
intervals until the samples have completely evaporated or have left a98 naphtha
Figure 4.4. Density weighing bottle residue that does not evaporate further (ASTM D-381, ASTM D-1353,
IP 131).
The evaporation rate can be derived either (1) by a plot of time versus
weight using a solvent having a known evaporation rate for comparison or
(2) from the distillation proﬁle (ASTM D-86, IP 123).
4.3.6. Flash Point
The ﬂash point is the lowest temperature at atmospheric pressure (760
mmHg, 101.3 kPa) at which application of a test ﬂame will cause the vapor
of a sample to ignite under speciﬁed test conditions. The sample is deemed
to have reached the ﬂash point when a large ﬂame appears and instanta-
neously propagates itself over the surface of the sample. Flash point data
are used in shipping and safety regulations to deﬁne ﬂammable and com-
bustible materials. Flash point data can also indicate the possible presence
of highly volatile and ﬂammable constituents in a relatively nonvolatile or
nonﬂammable material.
Of the available test methods, the most common method of determining
the ﬂash point conﬁnes the vapor (closed cup method) until the instant the
ﬂame is applied (ASTM D-56, ASTM D-93, ASTM D-3828, 6450, IP 34, IP
94, IP 303) (Fig. 4.5). An alternate method that does not conﬁne the vaportest methods 99
Figure 4.5. Pensky-Marten’s ﬂash point apparatus (ASTM D-56) (open cup method) (ASTM D-92, ASTM D-1310, IP 36) gives slightly
higher values of the ﬂash point.
Erroneously high ﬂash points can be obtained when precautions are not
taken to avoid the loss of volatile material. Samples should not be stored
in plastic bottles, because the volatile material may diffuse through the walls
of the container. The containers should not be opened unnecessarily. The
samples should not be transferred between containers unless the sample
temperature is at least 20°F (11°C) below the expected ﬂash point.
Another test (ASTM E-659) that can be used as a complement to the
ﬂash point test involves determination of the auto-ignition temperature.
However, the ﬂash point should not be confused with auto-ignition tem-
perature, which measures spontaneous combustion with no external source
of ignition.
4.3.7. Kauri-Butanol Value
The kauri-butanol value (ASTM D-1133) is the number of milliliters of the
solvent, at 15°C (77°F), required to produce a deﬁned degree of turbidity
when added to 20 g of a standard solution of gum kauri resin in n-butyl
alcohol. The kauri-butanol value of naphtha is used to determine relative
solvent power.
For kauri-butanol values of 60 and higher, the standard is toluene, which
has an assigned value of 105, whereas for kauri-butanol values less than 60,
the standard is a blend of 75% n-heptane and 25% toluene, which has an
assigned value of 40. The kauri-butanol value of products that are classiﬁed
as regular mineral spirits normally varies between 34 and 44; xylene is 93,
and aromatic naphtha falls in the range 55–108.
However, the data obtained by the kauri-butanol test depend on factors
other than solvent power and are speciﬁc to the solute used. For this reason,
the aniline point is often preferred to the kauri-butanol number.
4.3.8. Odor and Color
The degree of purity of naphtha is an important aspect of naphtha proper-
ties, and strict segregation of all distribution equipment is maintained to
ensure strict and uniform speciﬁcation for the product handled. Naphtha is
reﬁned to a low level of odor to meet the speciﬁcations for use.
In general the parafﬁnic hydrocarbons possess the mildest odor and the
aromatics the strongest, the odor level (ASTM D-268, ASTM D-1296, IP
89) being related to the chemical character and volatility of the constituents.
Odors caused by the presence of sulfur compounds or unsaturated con-
stituents are excluded by speciﬁcation. And apart from certain high-boiling
aromatic fractions, which are usually excluded by volatility from the major-100 naphthaity of the naphtha fractions, which may be pale yellow in color, naphtha is
usually colorless (water white).
Measurement of color (ASTM D-l56, ASTM D-848, ASTM D-1209,
ASTM D-1555, ASTM D-5386, IP 17) provides a rapid method of check-
ing the degree of freedom from contamination. Observation of the test for
residue on evaporation (ASTM D-381, ASTM D-1353, IP 131) provides a
further guard against adventitious contamination.
4.3.9. Volatility
Distillation, as a means of determining the boiling range (hence the vola-
tility ) of petroleum and petroleum products, has been in use since the 
beginning of the petroleum industry and is an important aspect of pro-
duct speciﬁcations.
Thus one of the most important physical parameters is the boiling range
distribution (ASTM D-86, ASTM D-1078, ASTM D-2887, ASTM D-2892,
IP 123). The signiﬁcance of the distillation test is the indication of volatil-"
"ity, which dictates the evaporation rate, an important property for naphtha
used in coatings and similar applications where the premise is that the
naphtha evaporates over time, leaving the coating applied to the surface.
In the basic test method (ASTM D-86, IP 123) a 100-ml sample is dis-
tilled (manually or automatically) under prescribed conditions. Tempera-
tures and volumes of condensate are recorded at regular intervals, from
which the boiling proﬁle is derived.
The determination of the boiling range distribution of distillates such as
naphtha and gasoline by gas chromatography (ASTM D-3710) not only
helps identify the constituents but also facilitates on-line controls at the
reﬁnery. This test method is designed to measure the entire boiling range
of naphtha with either high or low Reid vapor pressure (ASTM D-323, IP
69). In this method, the sample is injected into a gas chromatographic
column that separates hydrocarbons in boiling point order. The column
temperature is raised at a reproducible rate, and the area under the chro-
matogram is recorded throughout the run. Calibration is performed with a
known mixture of hydrocarbons covering the expected boiling range of the
sample.
Another method is described as a method for determining the carbon
number distribution (ASTM D-2887, IP 321), and the data derived by this
test method are essentially equivalent to those obtained by true boiling
point (TBP) distillation (ASTM D-2892). The sample is introduced into a
gas chromatographic column that separates hydrocarbons in boiling point
order.The column temperature is raised at a reproducible rate, and the area
under the chromatogram is recorded throughout the run. Boiling temper-
atures are assigned to the time axis from a calibration curve obtained undertest methods 101the same conditions by running a known mixture of hydrocarbons cover-
ing the boiling range expected in the sample. From these data, the boiling
range distribution may be obtained. However, this test method is limited to
samples with a boiling range greater than 55°C (100°F) and having a vapor
pressure (ASTM D-323, ASTM D-4953, ASTM D-5190, ASTM D-5191,
ASTM D-5482, ASTM D-6377, ASTM D-6378, IP 69, IP 394) sufﬁciently
low to permit sampling at ambient temperature.
Naphtha grades are often referred to by boiling points, that is, the
deﬁned temperature range in which the fraction distills. The ranges are
determined by standard methods (ASTM D-8, ASTM D-107, IP 123, IP
195), it being especially necessary to use a recognized method because 
the initial and ﬁnal boiling points, which ensure conformity with volatility
requirements and absence of heavy ends , are themselves affected by the
testing procedure.
A simple test for the evaporation properties of naphtha is available
(ASTM D-381, IP 131), but the volatility of naphtha is generally considered
a measure of its drying time in use. And the temperature of use obviously
governs the choice of naphtha. A high- boiling narrow distillation fraction
of gas oil may be required for a heat-set ink, where the operating temper-
ature may be as high as 316°C (600°F). However, the need for vacuum dis-
tillation (ASTM D-1160) as a product speciﬁcation in the boiling range of
naphtha is not necessary. By deﬁnition, naphtha very rarely has such a high
boiling point.
Although pure hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, heptane, benzene,
toluene, and xylene, which are now largely of petroleum origin, may be
characterized by a ﬁxed boiling point, naphtha is a mixture of many hydro-
carbons and cannot be so identiﬁed.The distillation test does, however, give
a useful indication of their volatility. The data obtained should include the
initial and ﬁnal temperatures of distillation together with sufﬁcient tem-
perature and volume observations to permit a characteristic distillation
curve to be drawn.
This information is especially important when a formulation includes
other volatile liquids because the performance of the product will be
affected by the relative volatility of the constituents. An illustration of the
importance of this aspect is found in the use of speciﬁcally deﬁned boiling
point naphtha in cellulose lacquers, where a mixture with ester, alcohols,
and other solvents may be employed. The naphtha does not act as a solvent
for the cellulose ester but is incorporated as a diluent to control the vis-
cosity and ﬂow properties of the mixture. If the solvent evaporates too
rapidly blistering and pimpling of the surface coating may result, whereas
if the solvent evaporates unevenly, leaving behind a higher proportion of
the naphtha, precipitation of the cellulose may occur, leading to a milky
opaqueness known as blushing.102 naphthaAlthough much dependence is placed on the assessment of volatility by
distillation methods, some speciﬁcations include measurement of drying
time by evaporation from a ﬁlter paper or dish. Laboratory measurements"
"are expressed as evaporation rate either by reference to a pure compound
evaporated under conditions similar to those for the sample under test or
by constructing a time-weight loss curve under standard conditions.
Although the results obtained on the naphtha provide a useful guide, it is
better, wherever possible, to carry out a performance test on the ﬁnal
product when assessing formulations.
In choosing naphtha for a particular purpose it is necessary to relate
volatility to the ﬁre hazard associated with its use, storage, and transport
and also with the handling of the products arising from the process. This is
normally based on the characterization of the solvent by ﬂash point limits
(ASTM D-56, ASTM D-93, IP 34, IP 170).

GASOLINE
5.1. INTRODUCTION
Gasoline (also referred to as motor gasoline, petrol in Britain, benzine in
Europe) is a mixture of volatile, ﬂammable liquid hydrocarbons derived
from petroleum that is used as fuel for internal combustion engines such as
occur in motor vehicles, excluding aircraft (Guthrie, 1967; Boldt and 
Grifﬁths, 1973; Weissermel and Arpe, 1978; Francis, and Peters, 1980;
Hoffman, 1983; Austin, 1984; Hoffman and McKetta, 1993; McCann, 1998;
Speight, 1999).
The boiling range of motor gasoline falls between –1°C (30°F) and 216°C
(421°F) and has the potential to contain several hundred isomers of the
various hydrocarbons (Tables 5.1 and 5.2)—a potential that may be 
theoretical and never realized in practice (Gruse and Stevens, 1960). The
hydrocarbon constituents in this boiling range are those that have 4–12
carbon atoms in their molecular structure and fall into three general 
types: (1) parafﬁns (including the cycloparafﬁns and branched materials),
(2) oleﬁns, and (3) aromatics. Gasoline boils at about the same range as
naphtha (a precursor to gasoline) but below kerosene (Fig. 5.1).
The various test methods dedicated to the determination of the amounts
of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen (ASTM D-5291) as well as the deter-
mination of oxygen, sulfur, metals, and chlorine (ASTM D-808) are not
included in this discussion. Although necessary, the various tests available
for composition (Chapter 2) are left to the discretion of the analyst. In 
addition, test methods recommended for naphtha (Chapter 4) may also be
applied, in many circumstances, to gasoline.
5.2. PRODUCTION AND PROPERTIES
Gasoline was at ﬁrst produced by distillation, simply separating the volatile,
more valuable fractions of crude petroleum, and was composed of the 
naturally occurring constituents of petroleum. Later processes, designed to
raise the yield of gasoline from crude oil, split higher-molecular-weight 
constituents into lower-molecular-weight products by processes known as
105cracking . And, like typical gasoline, several processes (Table 5.3) produce
the blending stocks for gasoline.
By way of deﬁnition of some of these processes, polymerization is the
conversion of gaseous oleﬁns such as propylene and butylene into larger
molecules in the gasoline range.106 gasoline

Thus gasoline is a mixture of hydrocarbons that boils below 180 ∞C
(355∞F) or, at most, below 200 ∞C (390∞F). The hydrocarbon constituents in
this boiling range are those that have 4–12 carbon atoms in their molecu-
lar structure. The hydrocarbons of which gasoline is composed fall into
three general types: parafﬁns (including the cycloparafﬁns and branched
materials), oleﬁns, and aromatics.
The hydrocarbons produced by modern reﬁning techniques (distillation,
cracking, reforming, alkylation, isomerization, and polymerization) provide
blending components for gasoline production (Speight, 1999; Speight and
Ozum, 2002).
Gasoline consists of a very large number of different hydrocarbons, and
the individual hydrocarbons in gasoline cannot be conveniently used to
describe gasoline. The composition of gasoline is best expressed in terms of
hydrocarbon types (saturates, oleﬁns, and aromatics) that enable inferences
to be made about the behavior in service.108 gasoline

The test protocols used for gasoline are similar to the protocols used for
naphtha.The similarity of the two liquids requires the application of similar
test methods. However, knocking properties are emphasized for gasoline
and there are several other differences that must be recognized. But, all in
all, consultation of the test methods used for the analysis of naphtha
(Chapter 4) can assist in developing protocols for gasoline.
The properties of gasoline are quite diverse, and the principal properties
affecting the performance of gasoline are volatility and combustion 
characteristics. These properties are adjusted according to the topography
and climate of the country in which the gasoline is to be used. For example,
mountainous regions will require gasoline with volatility and knock 
characteristics somewhat different from those that are satisfactory in ﬂat or
undulating country only a little above sea level. Similarly, areas that exhibit
extremes of climatic temperature, such as the northern provinces of
Canada, where temperatures of 30°C (86°F) in the summer are often 
followed by temperatures as low as –40°C (–40°F) in the winter, necessitate
special consideration, particularly with regard to volatility.
Because of the high standards set for gasoline, as with naphtha, it is
essential to use the correct techniques when taking samples for testing
(ASTM D-270, ASTM D-4057, IP 51). Mishandling, or the slightest trace of
contaminant, can give rise to misleading results. Special care is necessary to
ensure that containers are scrupulously clean and free from odor. Samples
should be taken with the minimum of disturbance so as to avoid loss of
volatile components; in the case of the lightest solvents it may be necessary
to chill the sample.
While awaiting examination, samples should be kept in a cool dark place
so as to ensure that they do not discolor or develop odors."
"5.3.1. Additives
Additives are chemical compounds intended to improve some speciﬁc prop-
erties of gasoline or other petroleum products and can be monofunctional
or multifunctional (Table 5.4; ASTM D-2669). Different additives, even
when added for identical purposes, may be incompatible with each other
and may, for example, react and form new compounds. Consequently, a
blend of two or more gasolines, containing different additives, may form a
system in which the additives react with each other and so deprive the blend
of their beneﬁcial effect.
Thus certain substances added to gasoline, notably the lead alkyls, have a
profound effect on antiknock properties and inhibit the precombustion oxi-
dation chain that is known to promote knocking. For a considerable period,test methods 109tetraethyl lead (TEL) was the preferred compound, but more recently
tetramethyl lead (TML) has been shown to have advantages with certain
modern types of gasoline because of its lower boiling point (110°C/230°F 
as against 200°C/392°F for tetraethyl lead) and therefore its higher vapor
pressure, which enables it to be more evenly distributed among the engine
cylinders with the more volatile components of the gasoline.
Some gasoline may still contain tetramethyl lead and tetraethyl lead,
whereas others contain compounds prepared by a chemical reaction
between tetramethyl lead and tetraethyl lead in the presence of a catalyst.
These chemically reacted compounds contain various proportions of
tetramethyl lead and tetraethyl lead and their intermediates, trimethylethyl
lead, dimethyldiethyl lead, and methyltriethyl lead, and thus provide anti-
knock compounds with a boiling range of 110–200°C (230–392°F). The lead
compounds, if used alone, would cause an excessive accumulation of lead
compounds in the combustion chambers of the engine and on sparking110 gasoline

liquid dyesplugs and valves. Therefore “scavengers” such as dibromoethane, alone or
in admixture with dichloroethane, are added to the lead alkyl and combine
with the lead during the combustion process to form volatile compounds
that pass harmlessly from the engine.
The amount of lead alkyl compounds used in gasoline is normally
expressed in terms of equivalent grams of metallic lead per gallon or per
liter. The maximum concentration of lead permitted in gasoline varies from
country to country according to governmental legislation or accepted 
commercial practice, and it is a subject that is currently under discussion in
many countries because of the attention being paid to reduction of exhaust
emissions from the spark ignition engine.
The total lead in gasoline may be determined gravimetrically (ASTM D-
52, IP 96), polarographically (ASTM D-1269), by atomic absorption spec-
trometry (ASTM D-3237, IP 428), by the iodine chloride method (ASTM
D-3341, IP 270), by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrom-
etry (ASTM D-5185), and by X-ray ﬂuorescence (ASTM D-5059). When it
is desired to estimate tetraethyl lead a method is available (IP 116), whereas
for the separate determination of tetramethyl lead and tetraethyl lead
recourse can be made to separate methods (ASTM D-l949, IP 188).
Other additives used in gasoline include antioxidants and metal deacti-
vators for inhibiting gum formation, surface-active agents and freezing
point depressants for preventing carburetor icing, deposit modiﬁers for
reducing spark plug fouling and surface ignition, and rust inhibitors (ASTM
D-665, IP 135) for preventing the rusting of steel tanks and pipe work 
by the traces of water carried in gasoline. For their estimation specialized
procedures involving chemical tests and physical techniques such as 
spectroscopy and chromatography have been used successfully.
Test methods have been developed to measure ethers and alcohols in"
"gasoline-range hydrocarbons, because oxygenated components such as
methyl-tert-butylether and ethanol are common blending components in
gasoline (ASTM D-4814, ASTM D-4815, ASTM D-5441, ASTM D-5599,
ASTM D-5986 ASTM D-5622, ASTM D-5845, ASTM D-6293).
Another type of gasoline sometimes referred to as vaporizing oil or
power kerosene is primarily intended as a gasoline for agricultural tractors
and is, in effect, a low-volatility (higher boiling) gasoline. For reliable opera-
tion, such a gasoline must not be prone to deposit formation (sediment or
gum) and the residue on evaporation (ASTM D-381, IP 131) must, there-
fore, be low. The volatility of vaporizing oil is, as for regular gasoline,
assessed by the distillation test (ASTM D-86, IP 123), the requirement 
normally being controlled by the percentages boiling at 160°C and 200°C
(320°F and 392°F).
Because of the lower volatility of vaporizing oil compared with that of
gasoline, a relatively high proportion of aromatics (ASTM D-4420) may betest methods 111necessary to maintain the octane number although unsaturated hydro-
carbons may also be used in proportions compatible with stability require-
ments. However, the presence of unsaturated constituents must be carefully
monitored because of the potential for incompatibility through the forma-
tion of sediment and gum. Other tests include ﬂash point (closed cup
method: ASTM D-56, ASTM D-93, ASTM D-3828, 6450, IP 34, IP 94, IP
303; open cup method: ASTM D-92, ASTM D-1310, IP 36), sulfur content
(ASTM D-1266, IP 107), corrosion (ASTM D-l30, ASTM D-849, IP 154),
octane number (ASTM D-2699, ASTM D-2700, ASTM D-2885, IP 236, IP
237), and residue on evaporation (ASTM D-381, ASTM D-1353, IP 131).
Although trace elements such as lead (ASTM D-52, ASTM D-1269,
ASTM D-3116, ASTM D-3237, ASTM D-3441, ASTM D-5059, ASTM D-
5185, IP 96, IP 228, IP 270), manganese (ASTM D-3831), and phosphorus
(ASTM D-3231) are not always strictly additives, tests for the presence 
of these elements must be stringently followed because their presence can
have an adverse affect on gasoline performance or on the catalytic 
converter.
5.3.2. Combustion Characteristics
Combustion in the spark ignition engine depends chieﬂy on engine design
and gasoline quality. Under ideal conditions, the ﬂame initiated at the spark-
ing plug spreads evenly across the combustion space until all the gasoline
has been burned. The increase in temperature caused by the spreading of
the ﬂame results in an increase in pressure in the end gas zone, which is that
part of the gasoline-air mixture that the ﬂame has not yet reached. The
increase in temperature and pressure in the end gas zone causes the gaso-
line to undergo preﬂame reactions. Among the main preﬂame products are
the highly temperature-sensitive peroxides, and if these exceed a certain
critical threshold concentration, the end gas will spontaneously ignite
before the arrival of the ﬂame front emanating from the sparking plug; this
causes detonation or knocking . On the other hand, if the ﬂame front reaches
the end gas zone before the buildup of the critical threshold peroxide 
concentration, the combustion of the gasoline-air mixture will be without
knock .
The various types of hydrocarbons in gasoline behave differently in their
preﬂame reactions and thus, their tendency to knock. It is difﬁcult to ﬁnd
any precise relationship between chemical structure and antiknock per-
formance in an engine. Members of the same hydrocarbon series may show
very different antiknock effects. For example, normal heptane and normal
pentane, both parafﬁns, have antiknock ratings (octane numbers) of 0 and
61.9, respectively (Table 5.5). Very generally, aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g.,
benzene and toluene), highly branched iso-parafﬁns (e.g., iso-octane), and112 gasolineoleﬁns (e.g., diisobutylene) have high antiknock values. In an intermediate
position are iso-parafﬁns with little branching and naphthenic hydro-
carbons (e.g., cyclohexane), whereas the normal parafﬁns (e.g., normal
heptane) are of low antiknock value .
The knock rating of a gasoline is expressed as octane number and is the
percentage by volume of iso-octane (octane number 100, by deﬁnition) in
admixture with normal heptane (octane number 0, by deﬁnition) that has
the same knock characteristics as the gasoline being assessed.
Gasoline is normally rated by using two sets of conditions of differing
severity. One, known as the research method (ASTM D-2699, IP 237), gives
a rating applicable to mild operating conditions, that is, low inlet mixture
temperature and relatively low engine loading such as would be experi-
enced generally in passenger cars and light-duty commercial vehicles. The
other is the motor method (ASTM D-2700, ASTM D-2885, IP 236), which
represents more severe operating conditions, that is, relatively high inlet
mixture temperature and high engine loading such as would be experienced
during full-throttle operation at high speed.test methods 113"

Toluene 120.1 103.5Research octane numbers are generally higher than those obtained by
the motor method, and the difference between the two ratings is known as
the sensitivity of the gasoline. The sensitivity of low-octane-number gaso-
line is usually small, but with high-octane gasoline it varies greatly accord-
ing to gasoline composition and for most commercial blends it is between
7 and 12 in the 90–00 research octane number range. The actual perform-
ance of a gasoline on the road (the road octane number ) usually falls
between the research and motor values and depends on the engine used
and also on the gasoline composition and choice of antiknock compounds.
To avoid the confusion arising from the use of two separate octane
number scales, one below and one above 100, an arbitrary extension of the
octane number scale was selected so that the value in terms of automotive
engine performance of each unit between 100 and 103 was similar to those
between 97 and 100. The relationship between the octane number scale
above 100 and the performance number scale is:
Octane number =100 +(performance number – 100)/3
and the relationship between tetraethyl lead concentration in iso-octane
and octane number is given in various test methods (ASTM D-270, ASTM
D-2699, IP 236, IP 237).
The heat of combustion (ASTM D-240, ASTM D-2382, IP 12) is a direct
measure of gasoline energy content and is determined as the quantity 
of heat liberated by the combustion of a unit quantity of gasoline with
oxygen in a standard bomb calorimeter. This gasoline property affects the
economics of engine performance, and the speciﬁed minimum value is a
compromise between the conﬂicting requirements of maximum gasoline
availability and consumption characteristics.
An alternative criterion of energy content is the aniline gravity product
(AGP), which is fairly accurately related to caloriﬁc value but more easily
determined. It is the product of the gravity at 60°F (expressed in degrees
API) and the aniline point of the gasoline in °F (ASTM D-611, IP 2). The
aniline point is the lowest temperature at which the gasoline is miscible with
an equal volume of aniline and is inversely proportional to the aromatic
content and related to the caloriﬁc value (ASTM D-1405, IP 193).
5.3.3. Composition
As with naphtha, the number of potential hydrocarbon isomers in the gaso-
line boiling range (Table 5.2) renders complete speciation of individual
hydrocarbons impossible for the gasoline distillation range, and methods
are used that identify the hydrocarbon types as chemical groups rather than
as individual constituents.114 gasolineIn terms of hydrocarbon components, several procedures have been
devised for the determination of hydrocarbon type, and the method based
on ﬂuorescent indicator adsorption (ASTM D-l319, IP 156) is the most
widely employed. Furthermore, aromatic content is a key property of low-
boiling distillates such as gasoline because the aromatic constituents inﬂu-
ence a variety of properties including boiling range (ASTM D-86, IP 123),
viscosity (ASTM D-88, ASTM D-445, ASTM D-2161, IP 71), and stability
(ASTM D-525, IP 40). Existing methods use physical measurements and
need suitable standards. Tests such as aniline point (ASTM D-611) and
kauri-butanol number (ASTM D-1133) are of a somewhat empirical nature
and can serve a useful function as control tests. However, gasoline compo-
sition is monitored mainly by gas chromatography (ASTM D-2427, ASTM
D-6296).
A multidimensional gas chromatographic method (ASTM D-5443) pro-
vides for the determination of parafﬁns, naphthenes, and aromatics by
carbon number in low oleﬁnic hydrocarbon streams having ﬁnal boiling
points lower than 200°C (392°F). In this method, the sample is injected into
a gas chromatographic system that contains a series of columns and switch-
ing values. First a polar column retains polar aromatic compounds, binaph-
thenes, and high-boiling parafﬁns and naphthenes. The eluant from this
column goes through a platinum column that hydrogenates oleﬁns and then
to a molecular sieve column that performs a carbon number separation
based on the molecular structure, that is, naphthenes and parafﬁns.The frac-
tion remaining on the polar column is further divided into three separate
fractions that are then separated on a nonpolar column by boiling point. A
ﬂame ionization detector detects eluting compounds.
In another method (ASTM D-4420) for the determination of the amount"
"of aromatic constituents, a two-column chromatographic system connected
to a dual-ﬁlament thermal conductivity detector (or two single ﬁlament
detectors) is used.The sample is injected into the column containing a polar
liquid phase. The nonaromatics are directed to the reference side of the
detector and vented to the atmosphere as they elute. The column is back-
ﬂushed immediately before the elution of benzene, and the aromatic
portion is directed into the second column containing a nonpolar liquid
phase. The aromatic components elute in the order of their boiling points
and are detected on the analytical side of the detector. Quantitation is
achieved by utilizing peak factors obtained from the analysis of a sample
having a known aromatic content. However, the method may be suscepti-
ble to errors caused by alkyl-substituted aromatics (Fig. 5.2) where the
boiling point increases because of the alkyl side chain and this increase
bears little relationship to the aromatic ring.
Other methods for the determination of aromatics in gasoline include a
method (ASTM D-5580) using a ﬂame ionization detector and methods intest methods 115which a combination of gas chromatography and Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (GC-FTIR) (ASTM D-5986) and gas chromatography and
mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (ASTM D-5769) are used.
The accurate measurements of benzene, and/or toluene, and total aro-
matics in gasoline are regulated test parameters in gasoline (ASTM D-3606,
ASTM D-5580,ASTM D-5769,ASTM D-5986).The precision and accuracy
of some of these tests are diminished in gasoline containing ethanol or
methanol, because these components often do not completely separate
from the benzene peak.
Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, the xylene isomers, as well as C 9
aromatics and higher-boiling aromatics are determined by gas chromato-
graphy, and the test (ASTM D5580) was developed to include gasoline 
containing commonly encountered alcohols and ethers. This test is the 
designated test for determining benzene and total aromatics in gasoline and
includes testing gasoline containing oxygenates and uses a ﬂame ioniza-
tion detector. Another method that employs the ﬂame ionization tech-
nique (ASTM D-1319, IP 156) is widely used for measuring total oleﬁns in
gasoline fractions as well as aromatics and saturates, although the results116 gasoline
Figure 5.2. Effect of increasing length of the alkyl chain on the boiling point may need correction for the presence of oxygenates. Gas chromatography
is also used for the determination of oleﬁns in gasoline (ASTM D-6296).
Benzene in gasoline can also be measured by infrared spectroscopy
(ASTM D-4053). But additional beneﬁts are derived from hyphenated
analytical methods such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (ASTM
D-5769) and gas chromatography-Fourier transform infrared spectros-
copy) ASTM D-5986), which also accurately measure benzene in gasoline.
The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method (ASTM D-5769) is
based on the Environmental Protection Agency’s gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry (EPA GC/MS) procedure for aromatics.
Hydrocarbon composition is also determined by mass spectrometry—a
technique that has seen wide use for hydrocarbon-type analysis of gasoline
(ASTM D-2789) as well as to the identiﬁcation of hydrocarbon constituents
in higher-boiling gasoline fractions (ASTM D-2425).
One method (ASTM D-6379, IP 436) is used to determine the monoaro-
matic and diaromatic hydrocarbon contents in distillates boiling in the
range from 50 to 300°C (122–572°F). In this method the sample is diluted
with an equal volume of hydrocarbon, such as heptane, and a ﬁxed volume
of this solution is injected into a high-performance liquid chromatograph
ﬁtted with a polar column where separation of the aromatic hydrocarbons
from the nonaromatic hydrocarbons occurs. The separation of the aromatic
constituents appears as distinct bands according to ring structure, and a
refractive index detector is used to identify the components as they elute
from the column.The peak areas of the aromatic constituents are compared
with those obtained from previously run calibration standards to calculate
the % w/w monoaromatic hydrocarbon constituents and diaromatic hydro-
carbon constituents in the sample.
Compounds containing sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen could possibly 
interfere with the performance of the test. Monoalkenes do not interfere,
but conjugated di- and polyalkenes, if present, may interfere with the test
performance.
Parafﬁns, naphthenes, and aromatic hydrocarbons in gasoline and other
distillates boiling up to 200°C (392°F) are determined by multidimensional
gas chromatography (ASTM D-5443).Oleﬁns that are present are converted
to saturates and are included in the parafﬁn and naphthene distribution.
However, the scope of this test does not allow it to be applicable to hydro-
carbons containing oxygenates. An extended version of the method can"
"be used to determine the amounts of parafﬁns, oleﬁns, naphthenes, and aro-
matics (PONA) in gasoline-range hydrocarbon fractions (ASTM D-6293).
A titration procedure (ASTM D-1159), which determines the bromine
number of petroleum distillates and aliphatic oleﬁns by electrometric titra-
tion, can be used to provide an approximation of oleﬁn content in a sample.
Another related method (ASTM D-2710) is used to determine the brominetest methods 117index of petroleum hydrocarbons by electrometric titration and is valuable
for determining trace levels of oleﬁns in gasoline. Obviously, these methods
use an indirect route to determine the total oleﬁns, and the type of oleﬁnic
compound present affects the results because the results depend on the
ability of the oleﬁns to react with bromine. Steric factors can prove to have
an adverse affect on the experimental data.
The compositional analysis of gasoline, up to and including n-nonane,
can be achieved using by capillary gas chromatography (ASTM Test
Method D5134). Higher-resolution gas chromatography capillary column
techniques provide a detailed analysis of most of the individual hydro-
carbons in gasoline, including many of the oxygenated blending compo-
nents. Capillary gas chromatographic techniques can be combined with mass
spectrometry to enhance the identiﬁcation of the individual components
and hydrocarbon types.
The presence of pentane and lighter hydrocarbons in gasoline interferes
in the determination of hydrocarbon types (ASTM D-1319 and ASTM D-
2789). Pentane and lighter hydrocarbons are separated by this test method
so that the depentanized residue can be analyzed, and pentane and lighter
hydrocarbons can be analyzed by other methods, if desired. Typically about
2% by volume of pentane and lower-boiling hydrocarbons remain in the
bottoms, and hexane and higher-boiling hydrocarbons carry over to the
overhead. In this test (ASTM D-2001) a 50-ml sample is distilled into an
overhead (pentane and lower-boiling hydrocarbons) fraction and a bottoms
(hexane and higher-boiling hydrocarbons) fraction. The volume of bottoms
is measured, and the percent by volume, based on the original gasoline
charged to the unit, is calculated.
Sulfur-containing components exist in gasoline-range hydrocarbons and
can be identiﬁed with a gas chromatographic capillary column coupled with
either a sulfur chemiluminescence detector or an atomic emission detector
(AED) (ASTM D-5623). The most widely speciﬁed method for total sulfur
content uses X-ray spectrometry (ASTM D-2622), and other methods 
that use ultraviolet ﬂuorescence spectroscopy (ASTM D-5453) and/or
hydrogenolysis and colorimetry (ASTM D-4045) are also applicable, par-
ticularly when the sulfur level is low.
5.3.4. Corrosiveness
Because a gasoline would be unsuitable for use if it corroded the metallic
parts of the gasoline system or the engine, it must be substantially free from
corrosive compounds both before and after combustion.
Corrosiveness is usually due to the presence of free sulfur and sulfur
compounds that burn to form sulfur dioxide (SO 2), which combines with
water vapor formed by the combustion of the gasoline to produce sulfurous118 gasolineacid (H 2SO 3). Sulfurous acid can, in turn, oxidize to sulfuric acid (H 2SO 4),
and both acids are corrosive toward iron and steel and would attack the
cooler parts of the engine’s exhaust system and its cylinders as they cool
off after the engine is shut down.
The total sulfur content of gasoline is very low, and knowledge of its mag-
nitude is of chief interest to the reﬁner who must produce a product that
conforms to a stringent speciﬁcation. Various methods are available for the
determination of total sulfur content. The one most frequently quoted in
speciﬁcations is the lamp method (ASTM D-1266, IP 107), in which the
gasoline is burned in a small wick-fed lamp in an artiﬁcial atmosphere of
carbon dioxide and oxygen; the oxides of sulfur are converted to sulfuric
acid, which is then determined either volumetrically or gravimetrically.
A more recent development is the Wickbold method (ASTM D-2785, IP
243). This is basically similar to the lamp method except that the sample is
burned in an oxy-hydrogen burner to give much more rapid combustion.
An alternative technique, which has the advantage of being nondestructive,
is X-ray spectrography (ASTM D-2622).
Mercaptan sulfur (R-SH) and hydrogen sulﬁde (H 2S) (ASTM D-1219,
IP 103, IP 104) are undesirable contaminants because, apart from their cor-
rosive nature, they possess an extremely unpleasant odor. Such compounds
should have been removed completely during reﬁning but their presence
and that of free sulfur are detected by application of the Doctor test (ASTM
D-4952, IP 30). The action on copper of any free or corrosive sulfur present
in gasoline may be estimated by a procedure (ASTM D-130, ASTM D-849,
IP 154) in which a strip of polished copper is immersed in the sample, which"
"is heated under speciﬁed conditions of temperature and time, and any stain-
ing of the copper is subsequently compared with the stains on a set of 
reference copper strips and thus the degree of corrosivity of the test sample
determined.
Total sulfur is determined by combustion in a bomb calorimeter (ASTM
D-129, IP 61) and is often carried out with the determination of caloriﬁc
value. The contents of the bomb are washed with distilled water into a
beaker after which hydrochloric acid is added and the solution is raised to
boiling point. Barium chloride is added drop by drop to the boiling solu-
tion to precipitate the sulfuric acid as granular barium sulfate.After cooling,
and standing for 24 h, the precipitate is ﬁltered off on an ashless paper,
washed, ignited, and weighed as barium sulfate.

tion (ASTM D-3227, IP 342), a piece of mechanically cleaned copper is 
also used to determine the amount of corrosive sulfur in a sample (ASTMtest methods 119D-130, IP 112, IP 154, IP 411). The pure sheet copper (3.0 ≤ ¥0.5≤/75 ¥
12 mm) is placed in a test tube with 40 ml of the sample, so that the copper
is completely immersed. The tube is closed with a vented cork and heated
in a boiling-water bath for 3h. The copper strip is then compared visually
with a new strip of copper for signs of tarnish. The results are recorded as:
No change: Result negative 
Slight discoloration: Result negative 
Brown shade: Some effect
Steel gray: Some effect
Black, not scaled: Result positive, corrosive sulfur present 
Black, scaled: Result positive, corrosive sulfur present 
Thus visual observation of the copper strip can present an indication or a con-
clusion of the presence or absence of corrosive sulfur.There is also a copper
strip corrosion method for liqueﬁed petroleum gases (ASTM D-1838).
5.3.5. Density (Speciﬁc Gravity)
Density (the mass of liquid per unit volume at 15°C) and the related terms
speciﬁc gravity (the ratio of the mass of a given volume of liquid at 15°C to the
mass of an equal volume of pure water at the same temperature.) and relative
density (same as speciﬁc gravity ) are important properties of petroleum and
petroleum products (Chapter 2). Usually a hydrometer, pycnometer, or
digital density meter is used for the determination in all these standards.
The determination of density (speciﬁc gravity) (ASTM D-287,ASTM D-
891, ASTM D-941, ASTM D-1217, ASTM D-1298, ASTM D-1555, ASTM
D-1657, ASTM D-2935, ASTM D-4052, ASTM D-5002, IP 160, IP 235, IP
365) provides a check on the uniformity of the gasoline, and it permits cal-
culation of the weight per gallon. The temperature at which the determi-
nation is carried out and for which the calculations are to be made should
also be known (ASTM D-1086). However, the methods are subject to vapor
pressure constraints and are used with appropriate precautions to prevent
vapor loss during sample handling and density measurement. In addition,
some test methods should not be applied if the samples are so dark in color
that the absence of air bubbles in the sample cell cannot be established with
certainty. The presence of such bubbles can have serious consequences for
the reliability of the test data.
The current speciﬁcation for automotive gasoline (ASTM D-4814) does
not set limits on the density of gasoline (ASTM D 1298, IP 160). However,
the density is ﬁxed by the other chemical and physical properties of the
gasoline and is important because gasoline is often bought and sold with120 gasolinereference to a speciﬁc temperature, usually 15.6°C (60°F). Because the
gasoline is usually not at the speciﬁed temperature, volume correction
factors based on the change in density with temperature are used to correct
the volume to that temperature. Volume correction factors for oxygenates
differ somewhat from those for hydrocarbons, and work is in progress to
determine precise correction factors for gasoline-oxygenate blends.
5.3.6. Flash Point and Fire Point
For some purposes it is necessary to have information on the initial stage
of vaporization and the potential hazards that such a property can cause.
To supply this need, ﬂash point ,ﬁre point ,vapor pressure , and evapora-
tion/distillation methods are available.
The ﬂash point is the lowest temperature at atmospheric pressure
(760mmHg, 101.3kPa) at which application of a test ﬂame will cause the
vapor of a sample to ignite under speciﬁed test conditions. The sample is
deemed to have reached the ﬂash point when a large ﬂame appears 
and instantaneously propagates itself over the surface of the sample. Flash
point data are used in shipping and safety regulations to deﬁne ﬂammable
and combustible materials. Flash point data can also indicate the possible
presence of highly volatile and ﬂammable constituents in a relatively non-
volatile or nonﬂammable material. The ﬂash point of a petroleum product"
"is also used to detect contamination. A substantially lower ﬂash point than
expected for a product is a reliable indicator that a product has become
contaminated with a more volatile product, such as gasoline.The ﬂash point
is also an aid in establishing the identity of a particular petroleum product.
Of the available test methods, the most common method of determining
the ﬂash point conﬁnes the vapor (closed cup method) until the instant the
ﬂame is applied (ASTM D-56, ASTM D-93, ASTM D-3828, 6450, IP 34, IP
94, IP 303). An alternate method that does not conﬁne the vapor (open cup
method) (ASTM D-92, ASTM D-1310, IP 36) gives slightly higher values
of the ﬂash point.
The Pensky–Marten apparatus using a closed or open system (ASTM 
D-93, IP 34, IP 35) is the standard instrument for ﬂash points above 
50°C (122°F), and the Abel apparatus (IP 170) is used for more volatile oils,
with ﬂash points below 50°C (122°F). The Cleveland open-cup method
(ASTM D- 92, IP 36) is also used for the determination of the ﬁre point
(the temperature at which the sample will ignite and burn for at least 5 s).
The Pensky–Marten apparatus consists of a brass cup mounted in an 
air bath and heated by a gas ﬂame. A propeller-type stirrer, operated by a
ﬂexible drive, extends from the center of the cover into the cup. The cover
has four openings: one for a thermometer and the others ﬁtted with sliding
shutters for the introduction of a pilot ﬂame and for ventilation. The tem-test methods 121perature of the oil in the cup is raised at a rate of 5–6°C/min (9–11°F/min).
The stirrer is rotated at approximately 60rpm. When the temperature has
risen to approximately 15°C (27°F) from the anticipated ﬂash point, the
pilot ﬂame is dipped into the oil vapor for 2 s for every 1°C (1.8°F) rise in
temperature up to 105°C (221°F). Above 105°C (221°F), the ﬂame is intro-
duced for every 2°C (3.6°F) rise in temperature. The ﬂash point is the tem-
perature at which a distinct ﬂash is observed when the pilot ﬂame meets
the vapor in the cup.
Erroneously high ﬂash points can be obtained when precautions are not
taken to avoid the loss of volatile material. Samples should not be stored
in plastic bottles, because the volatile material may diffuse through the walls
of the container. The containers should not be opened unnecessarily. The
samples should not be transferred between containers unless the sample
temperature is at least 20°F (11°C) below the expected ﬂash point.
The Abel closed-cup apparatus (IP 170) consists of a brass cup sealed in
a small water bath that is immersed in a second water bath. The cover of
the brass cup is ﬁtted in a manner similar to that in the Pensky–Marten
apparatus. For crude oils and products with ﬂash point higher than 30°C
(>86°F), the outer bath is ﬁlled with water at 55°C (131°F) and is not heated
further. The oil under test is then placed inside the cup. When the tempera-
ture reaches 19°C (66°F) the pilot ﬂame is introduced every 0.5°C (1.0°F)
until a ﬂash is obtained. For oils with ﬂash points in excess of 30°C ( >86°F)
and less than 50°C ( <122°F), the inner water bath is ﬁlled with cold water
to a depth of 35 mm. The outer bath is ﬁlled with cold water and heated at
a rate of 1°C/min (1.8°F/min). The ﬂash point is obtained as before.
From the viewpoint of safety, information about the ﬂash point is of most
signiﬁcance at or slightly above the maximum temperatures (30–60°C,
86–140°F)) that may be encountered in storage, transportation, and use 
of liquid petroleum products, in either closed or open containers. In this
temperature range the relative ﬁre and explosion hazard can be estimated
from the ﬂash point. For products with ﬂash point below 40°C (104°F)
special precautions are necessary for safe handling. Flash points above 60°C
(140°F) gradually lose their safety signiﬁcance until they become indirect
measures of some other quality.
Another test (ASTM E-659) is available that can be used as a comple-
ment to the ﬂash point test and involves determination of the auto-ignition
temperature. However, the ﬂash point should not be confused with 
auto-ignition temperature that measures spontaneous combustion with no
external source of ignition.
The ﬁre point is the temperature to which the product must be heated
under the prescribed conditions of the method to burn continuously when
the mixture of vapor and air is ignited by a speciﬁed ﬂame (ASTM D-92,
IP 36).122 gasoline5.3.7. Oxygenates
Blends of gasoline with oxygenates are common and, in fact, are required
in certain areas. These blends consist primarily of gasoline with substantial
amounts of oxygenates, which are oxygen-containing, ashless, organic 
compounds such as alcohols and ethers. The most common oxygenates are
ethanol and methyl- t-butyl ether (MTBE) with lesser attention focused on
ethyl- t-butyl ether (ETBE), t-amyl methyl ether (TAME), and di- iso-propyl
ether (DIPE).
Some of the test methods originally developed for gasoline can be used"
"for gasoline-oxygenate blends, whereas certain other test methods for gaso-
line are not suitable for blends. To avoid the necessity of determining in
advance whether a gasoline contains oxygenates there are test methods that
can be used for both gasoline and gasoline-oxygenate blends (ASTM D-
4814).
In general, the test methods for determining distillation temperatures,
lead content, sulfur content, copper corrosion, existent gum, and oxidation
stability can be used for both gasoline and gasoline-oxygenate blends. Some
of the test methods for vapor pressure and vapor-liquid ratio are sensitive
to the presence of oxygenates in the gasoline and must be acknowledged
accordingly.
Whereas gasoline and water are almost entirely immiscible, and will
readily separate into two phases, a gasoline-oxygenate blend is used to 
dissolve water without phase separation. hence the use of the term water
tolerance . Gasoline-oxygenate blends will dissolve some water but will 
also separate into two phases when contacted with water that is beyond 
the threshold concentration. Such a phenomenon is a major issue for
alcohol-containing blends.
Phase separation can usually be avoided if the gasoline is sufﬁciently
water free initially and care is taken during distribution to prevent contact
with water. Gasoline-oxygenate blends can be tested for water tolerance
(ASTM D-4814) by cooling gasoline under speciﬁed conditions to its
expected use temperature. Formation of a haze (analogous to the cloud
point; ASTM D-2500, ASTM D-5771, ASTM D-5772, ASTM D-5773, IP
219) must be carefully distinguished from separation into two distinct
phases and is not a reason for rejection of the gasoline.
5.3.8. Stability and Instability
The study of the analysis of crude oil products is incomplete without some
mention of instability and incompatibility . Both result in formation and
appearance of degradation products or other undesirable changes in the
original properties of petroleum products.test methods 123In terms of the instability and incompatibility of petroleum and petro-
leum products, the unsaturated hydrocarbon content and the heteroatom
content appear to represent the greatest inﬂuence. In fact, the sulfur and
nitrogen content of crude oil is an important parameter in respect of the
processing methods that must be used to produce gasoline of speciﬁcation
sulfur concentrations. There could well be a relation between nitrogen and
sulfur content and crude oil (or product) stability; higher-nitrogen and—
sulfur crude oils often exhibit higher sludge-forming tendencies.
Gasoline manufactured by cracking processes contains unsaturated com-
ponents that may oxidize during storage and form undesirable oxidation
products. Because gasoline is often stored before use, it is essential that any
components should not undergo any deleterious change under storage con-
ditions and should remain stable during their passage from the gasoline
tank of a vehicle to the cylinder of its engine so that no harmful deposits
are built up in the tank and gasoline lines, in the inlet system, and on the
valves.
During storage, gasoline is exposed to the action of air at ambient 
temperature, and in its path from vehicle tank to engine it is mixed with air
and also subjected to the effects of heat. An unstable gasoline will undergo
oxidation and polymerization under such conditions, forming gum, a res-
inous material, which in the early stages of chain reaction is initiated by the
formation of peroxides and catalyzed by the presence of metals, particu-
larly copper, which may have been picked up during reﬁning and handling
operations.
Instability occurs because of a low resistance of the product to environ-
mental (in use) inﬂuences during storage or its susceptibility to oxidative
and/or other degradative processes. In case of incompatibility, degradation
products form or changes occur because of an interaction of some chemi-
cal groups present in the components of the ﬁnal blend.
Petroleum product components can be deﬁned as being incompatible
when sludge, semisolid, or solid particles (for convenience here, these are
termed secondary products to distinguish them from the actual petroleum
product) are formed during and after blending. This phenomenon usually
occurs before use. If the secondary products are marginally soluble in the
blended petroleum product, use might detract from the solubility of the
secondary products and they will appear as sludge or sediment that can be
separated by centrifuge with water (ASTM D-2709) or by extraction
(ASTM D-4310, IP 53, IP 375).When the secondary products are truly insol-
uble, they separate and settle out as a semisolid or solid phase ﬂoating in
the gasoline or are deposited on the walls and ﬂoors of containers. In addi-
tion, secondary products usually increase the viscosity of the petroleum"
"product. Standing at low temperatures will also cause a viscosity change124 gasoline(ASTM D-2532). Usually the viscosity change might be due to separation
of parafﬁns as might occur when gasoline, but more especially diesel 
gasoline, is allowed to cool and stand unused overnight in low-temperature
climates.
Brieﬂy, the term incompatibility refers to the formation of a precipitate
(or sediment) or phase separation when two liquids are mixed. The term
instability is often used in reference to the formation of color, sediment, or
gum in the liquid over a period of time. This term may be used to contrast
the formation of a precipitate in the near term (almost immediately).
However, the terms are often used interchangeably.
The measurement of color (ASTM D-l56, ASTM D-848, ASTM D-1209,
ASTM D-1555, ASTM D-5386, IP 17) provides a rapid method of check-
ing the degree of freedom from contamination. Observation of the test for
residue on evaporation (ASTM D-381, ASTM D-1353, IP 131) provides a
further guard against adventitious contamination.
Tests should also be carried out for sediment if the gasoline has been
subjected to events (such as oxidation) that could lead to sediment forma-
tion and instability of the gasoline and the resulting products. Test methods
are available for the determination of sediment by extraction (ASTM D-
473, IP 285) or by membrane ﬁltration (ASTM D-4807, IP 286) and the
determination of sediment simultaneously with water by centrifugation
(ASTM D-96, ASTM D-1796, ASTM D-2709, ASTM D-4007, IP 373,
IP 374).
Gum formation (ASTM D-525, IP 40) alludes to the formation of soluble
organic material, whereas sediment is insoluble organic material. Storage
stability (or storage instability ) (ASTM D-381, ASTM D-4625, IP 131, IP
378) is a term used to describe the ability of the liquid to remain in storage
over extended periods of time without appreciable deterioration as meas-
ured by gum formation and/or the formation of sediment. Thermal stabil-
ityis deﬁned as the ability of the liquid to withstand relatively high
temperatures for short periods of time without the formation of sediment
(i.e., carbonaceous deposits and/or coke). Thermal oxidative stability is the
ability of the liquid to withstand relatively high temperatures for short
periods of time in the presence of oxidation and without the formation of
sediment or deterioration of properties (ASTM D-3241), and there is stan-
dard equipment for various oxidation tests (ASTM D-4871). Stability is also
deﬁned as the ability of the liquid to withstand long periods at tempera-
tures up to 100°C (212°F) without degradation. Determination of the reac-
tion threshold temperature for various liquid and solid materials might be
beneﬁcial (ASTM D-2883).
Existent gum is the name given to the nonvolatile residue present in the
gasoline as received for test (ASTM D-381, IP 131). In this test, the sampletest methods 125is evaporated from a beaker maintained at a temperature of 160–166°C
(320–331°F) with the aid of a similarly heated jet of air. This material is dis-
tinguished from the potential gum that is obtained by aging the sample at
an elevated temperature.
Thus potential gum is determined by the accelerated gum test (ASTM D-
873, IP 138), which is used as a safeguard of storage stability and can be
used to predict the potential for gum formation during prolonged storage.
In this test, the gasoline is heated for 16 h with oxygen under pressure in a
bomb at 100°C (212°F).After this time, both the gum content and the solids
precipitated are measured.
Dry sludge is deﬁned as the material separated from the bulk of an oil
by ﬁltration that is insoluble in heptane. Existent dry sludge is the dry sludge
in the original sample as received and is distinguished from the accelerated
dry sludge obtained after aging the sample by chemical addition or heat.
The existent dry sludge is distinguished from the potential dry sludge that is
obtained by aging the sample at an elevated temperature.
The existent dry sludge is operationally deﬁned as the material separated
from the bulk of a crude oil or crude oil product by ﬁltration that is insol-
uble in heptane. The test is used as an indicator of process operability and
as a measure of potential downstream fouling.
Attractive as they may be, any tests that involve accelerated oxidation of
the sample must be used with caution and consideration of the chemistry.
Depending on the constituents of the sample, it is quite possible that the
higher temperature and extreme conditions (oxygen under pressure) may
not be truly representative of the deterioration of the sample under storage
conditions. The higher temperature and the oxygen under pressure might
change the chemistry of the system and produce products that would not
be produced under ambient storage conditions. An assessment of the com-
position of the gasoline before storage and application of the test will assist
in this determination."
"Because gasoline contains traces of nonvolatile oils and additives, the
residue left in the beakers is washed with heptane before the gum residue
is dried and weighed. The existent gum test (ASTM D-381, IP 131) is useful
as a reﬁnery control but is to some extent unrealistic as a criterion of 
performance, and therefore engine tests have been developed to determine
the tendency toward inlet system deposits.
In general, gasoline instability and incompatibility can be related to the
heteroatom-containing (i.e., nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur containing) com-
pounds. The degree of unsaturation of the gasoline (i.e., the level of oleﬁnic
species) also plays a role in determining instability/incompatibility. And
recent investigations have also implicated catalytic levels of various oxi-
dized intermediates and acids as especially deleterious for middle distillate
gasoline.126 gasoline5.3.9. Volatility
The volatility of a liquid is its tendency to change from the liquid to the
vapor or gaseous state. Thus volatility is a primary and necessary charac-
teristic of most liquid gasoline. The distillation proﬁle is also a measure of
the relative amounts of the gasoline constituents in petroleum.
The volatility of gasoline affects the performance of the engine in a
number of ways, the chief of which are ease of starting, rate of warm-up,
vapor lock, carburetor icing, and crankcase dilution (the dilution of the
engine lubricating oil with the higher-boiling constituents of the gasoline).
The gasoline must be sufﬁciently volatile to give easy starting, rapid warm-
up, and adequate vaporization for proper distribution between the cylin-
ders. Conversely, it must not be so volatile that vapor losses from the
gasoline tank are excessive or that vapor is formed in the gasoline line,
causing vapor lock that may impede the ﬂow of gasoline to the carburetor.
Thus one of the most important physical parameters of gasoline is the
boiling range distribution (ASTM D-86, ASTM D-1078, ASTM D-2887,
ASTM D-2892, IP 123). The signiﬁcance of the distillation test is the 
indication of volatility, which dictates the evaporation rate, an important
property for gasoline used in coatings and similar applications where the
premise is that the gasoline evaporates over time, leaving the coating
applied to the surface. In the basic test method (ASTM D-86, IP 123) a 
100-ml sample is distilled (manually or automatically) under prescribed
conditions. Temperatures and volumes of condensate are recorded at
regular intervals, from which the boiling proﬁle is derived.
The determination of the boiling range distribution of gasoline by gas
chromatography (ASTM D-3710) not only helps identify the constituents
but also facilitates on-line controls at the reﬁnery. This test method is
designed to measure the entire boiling range of gasoline with either high
or low Reid vapor pressure (ASTM D-323, IP 69). In this method, the
sample is injected into a gas chromatographic column that separates hydro-
carbons in boiling point order.The column temperature is raised at a repro-
ducible rate, and the area under the chromatogram is recorded throughout
the run. Calibration is performed with a known mixture of hydrocarbons
covering the expected boiling of the sample.
Another method is described as a method for determining the carbon
number distribution (ASTM D-2887, IP 321), and the data derived by this
test method are essentially equivalent to that obtained by true boiling point
distillation (ASTM D-2892). The sample is introduced into a gas chro-
matographic column that separates hydrocarbons in boiling point order.
The column temperature is raised at a reproducible rate, and the area under
the chromatogram is recorded throughout the run. Boiling temperatures
are assigned to the time axis from a calibration curve, obtained under thetest methods 127same conditions by running a known mixture of hydrocarbons covering the
boiling range expected in the sample. From these data, the boiling range
distribution may be obtained. However, this test method is limited to
samples with a boiling range greater than 55°C (100°F) and having a vapor
pressure (ASTM D-323, ASTM D-4953, ASTM D-5190, ASTM D-5191,
ASTM D-5482, ASTM D-6377, ASTM D-6378, IP 69, IP 394) sufﬁciently
low to permit sampling at ambient temperature.
The volatility of petroleum and petroleum products is an important
aspect of safety and quality. It would be unsafe to attempt to store highly
volatile materials in the open sunlight or in an enclosed space where tem-
perature can rise to be in excess of 37.8°C (100°F).And yet, without any indi-
cations of when the material might vaporize and spontaneously ignite, there
is no way of even considering the correct storage and handling conditions.
The boiling points of petroleum fractions are rarely, if ever, distinct tem-
peratures, and it is, in fact, more correct to refer to the boiling range of a
particular fraction. To determine these ranges, the petroleum is tested in"
"various methods of distillation, either at atmospheric pressure or at reduced
pressure. A general estimate is that the limiting molecular weight range for
distillation at atmospheric pressure without thermal degradation is 200–
250amu whereas the limiting molecular weight range for conventional
vacuum distillation is 500–600 amu.
In each homologous series of hydrocarbons, the boiling point increases
with molecular weight. Structure also has a marked inﬂuence, and it is a
general rule that branched parafﬁn isomers have lower boiling points than
the corresponding n-alkane. However, the most dramatic illustration of the
variation in boiling point with carbon number is an actual plot for differ-
ent hydrocarbons (Fig. 5.1). In any given series, steric effects notwithstand-
ing, there is an increase in boiling point with an increase in carbon number
of the alkyl side chain (Fig. 5-2). This particularly applies to alkyl aromatic
compounds, where alkyl-substituted aromatic compounds can have higher
boiling points than polycondensed aromatic systems.This fact is very mean-
ingful when attempts are made to develop hypothetical structures for the
higher-molecular-weight constituents of petroleum (Speight, 1999, 2001).
At an early stage of characterization studies, a correlation was observed
between the quality of petroleum products and their hydrogen content
because gasoline,kerosene,diesel gasoline,and lubricating oil are made up of
hydrocarbon constituents containing high proportions of hydrogen.Thus it is
not surprising that tests to determine the volatility of petroleum and petro-
leum products were among the ﬁrst to be deﬁned. Indeed, volatility is one of
the major tests for petroleum products and it is inevitable that all products
will, at some stage of their history, be tested for volatility characteristics.
The boiling range of motor gasoline falls in the range 30–210°C
(86–410°F), and blending of the available reﬁnery components can main-
tain balance between the different volatility requirements. The volatility of128 gasolinegasoline is normally assessed by the distillation test (ASTM D-86, IP 123).
Determination of the boiling range distribution of gasoline and gasoline
fractions by gas chromatography (ASTM D-3710) can be used for deter-
mining the boiling point properties of oxygenate-free gasoline distillates
and this test has the advantage that it uses a smaller sample size and can
be more easily automated, but the data from the two tests may not be
directly equivalent.
The apparatus employed for the test provides little in the way of frac-
tionation and although the thermometer is accurately standardized at total
immersion, it is used at partial immersion and no temperature correc-
tions are made for emergent steam. However, provision is made in the
test for correcting the thermometer readings for variations in atmospheric
pressure whenever the barometric reading is sufﬁciently far from stan-
dard atmospheric pressure to make corrections desirable. Therefore,
although the temperatures are highly reproducible they are not true vapor
temperatures.
The vapor pressure of petroleum or a petroleum product is the force
exerted on the walls of a closed container by the vaporized portion of a
liquid. Conversely, it is the force that must be applied to the liquid to
prevent it vaporizing further. The vapor pressure increases with increase in
temperature and is variously expressed in terms of millimeters of mercury,
pounds per square inch, or other equivalent units of pressure depending on
common usage. Gasoline vapor pressure depends critically on its butane
content, and in the reﬁnery the ﬁnal adjustment of vapor pressure of a gaso-
line to meet the speciﬁcation is often made by butane injection.
The Reid vapor pressure (ASTM D-323, IP 69, IP 402) is a measure of
the vapor pressure of petroleum or a petroleum product an oil at 37.8°C
(100°F) expressed as millimeters of mercury. The apparatus used to deter-
mine the Reid vapor pressure consists of a metal cylinder, or bomb , ﬁtted
with an accurate dial pressure gauge or a mercury manometer. The bomb
consists of two parts, an upper expansion chamber and a lower liquid
chamber. The sample is cooled and poured into the lower chamber until it
is full. The temperature of the air in the upper chamber is taken, and the
two chambers are connected together in a gas-tight manner. The bomb is
immersed upright in a water bath at 37.8°C (100°F) and shaken repeatedly
until a constant pressure reading is obtained. This is corrected, from tables,
for initial air temperature and pressure.
Another method (ASTM D-5191) is now most commonly referenced in
gasoline regulations, and the method requires less sample and is much easier
and faster to run.Other methods for determining the vapor pressure of gaso-
line are also available (ASTM D-4953, ASTM D-5190, ASTM D-5482).
Thus petroleum can be subdivided by distillation into a variety of frac-"
"tions of different boiling ranges (cut points ) with a variety of standard
methods speciﬁcally designed for this task.test methods 129Distillation involves the general procedure of vaporizing the petroleum
liquid in a suitable ﬂask either at atmospheric pressure (ASTM D-86,ASTM
D-216, ASTM D-285, ASTM D447, ASTM D-2892, ASTM D-5236, IP 24,
IP 123, IP 191) or at reduced pressure (ASTM D-1160). Most of the methods
specify an upper atmospheric equivalent temperature (AET) limit of 360°C
(680°F) to mitigate the onset of thermal decomposition. For higher-boiling
fractions, the spinning band distillation method and a method of distillation
using a ﬂash still are available 
In the simplest case, the distillation method involves use of a standard
round-bottom distillation ﬂask of 250-ml capacity attached to a water-
cooled condenser. The thermometer bulb is placed at the opening to the
side arm of the ﬂask. One hundred milliliters of sample are placed in the
ﬂask and heated by a small gas ﬂame so as to produce ten milliliters of dis-
tillate every 4 or 5min. The temperature of initial distillation is recorded;
the temperature at which each further 10 ml distils and the ﬁnal boiling
point are also recorded.
Samples containing light components must be debutanized in a pre-
liminary step. In the method, a weighed sample of 1–10 liters is distilled
in a fractionating column having an efﬁciency at total reﬂux of 14–18 
theoretical plates. A reﬂux ratio of 5:1 is maintained throughout except
at the minimum pressure of 2 mmHg, where a ratio of 2:1 can be used.
The mass and density of each fraction are used to prepare distillation
curves either by mass or volume. This method is often referred to as the
15-5 method .
One method (ASTM D-1160) is available to determine the boiling
ranges of petroleum products to a maximum liquid temperature of 400°C
(752°F) at pressures as low as 1 mmHg and is adequate for gasoline. In the
method, a 200-ml sample is weighed to the nearest 0.1 g in a distillation
ﬂask. The distillation assembly is evacuated to the desired pressure, and
heat is applied to the ﬂask as rapidly as possible using a 750-W heater.When
reﬂuxing liquid appears, the rate of heating is adjusted so that the distillate
is recovered at 4–8 ml/min until the distillation is complete.
Generally, the distillation tests are planned so that the data are reported
in terms of one or more of the following items:
1.Initial boiling point is the thermometer reading in the neck of the 
distillation ﬂask when the ﬁrst drop of distillate leaves the tip of the
condenser tube.This reading is materially affected by a number of test
conditions, namely, room temperature, rate of heating, and condenser
temperature.
2.Distillation temperatures are usually observed when the level of the
distillate reaches each 10% mark on the graduated receiver, with the
temperatures for the 5% and 95% marks often included. Conversely,130 gasolinethe volume of the distillate in the receiver, that is, the percentage
recovered, is often observed at speciﬁed thermometer readings.
3.End point or maximum temperature is the highest thermometer
reading observed during distillation. In most cases it is reached when
all of the sample has been vaporized. If a liquid residue remains in
the ﬂask after the maximum permissible adjustments are made in
heating rate, this is recorded as indicative of the presence of very-
high-boiling compounds.
4.Dry point is the thermometer reading at the instant the ﬂask becomes
dry and is for special purposes, such as for solvents and for relatively
pure hydrocarbons. For these purposes dry point is considered more
indicative of the ﬁnal boiling point than end point or maximum 
temperature.
5.Recovery is the total volume of distillate recovered in the graduated
receiver, and residue is the liquid material, mostly condensed vapors,
left in the ﬂask after it has been allowed to cool at the end of distil-
lation. The residue is measured by transferring it to an appropriate
small graduated cylinder. Low or abnormally high residues indicate
the absence or presence, respectively, of high-boiling components.
6.Total recovery is the sum of the liquid recovery and residue; distilla-
tion loss is determined by subtracting the total recovery from 100%.
It is, of course, the measure of the portion of the vaporized sample
that does not condense under the conditions of the test. Like the
initial boiling point, distillation loss is affected materially by a number
of test conditions, namely, condenser temperature, sampling and
receiving temperatures, barometric pressure, heating rate in the early
part of the distillation, and others. Provisions are made for correcting
high distillation losses for the effect of low barometric pressure
because of the practice of including distillation loss as one of the items
in some speciﬁcations for motor gasoline.
7.Percentage evaporated is the percentage recovered at a speciﬁc ther-"
"mometer reading or other distillation temperatures, or the converse.
The amounts that have been evaporated are usually obtained by 
plotting observed thermometer readings against the corresponding
observed recoveries plus, in each case, the distillation loss. The initial
boiling point is plotted with the distillation loss as the percentage
evaporated. Distillation data are reproducible, particularly for the
more volatile products.
The capillary method can be used as one of two standardized methods
(ASTM D-2887, ASTM D-3710) that are available for the boiling point
determination of petroleum fractions and gasoline, respectively.The formertest methods 131method (ASTM D-2887) utilizes nonpolar, packed gas chromatographic
columns in conjunction with ﬂame ionization detection. The upper limit of
the boiling range covered by this method is approximately 540°C (1000°F)
atmospheric equivalent boiling point. Recent efforts in which high-
temperature gas chromatography was used have focused on extending the
scope of the method for higher-boiling petroleum materials to 800°C
(1470°F) atmospheric equivalent boiling point.
The measurement of pressure at the topof the distillation column is 
critical to valid distillation results because the observed vapor tempera-
ture must be corrected to the atmospheric equivalent temperature at stan-
dard pressure conditions (760mmHg). There is a general belief that the
minimum pressure should be 2mmHg or greater for reasonably accurate
measurements and correction to the atmospheric equivalent temperature.
At pressures below 2 mmHg, the pressure measurement is too inaccurate
and a discontinuity can arise in the atmospheric equivalent temperature 
distillation curve from atmospheric to vacuum distillation.
The precision and accuracy of the single internal standard method
depends on the accuracy of estimating the area of the internal standard. In
addition to the problems in determining the percentage of sample that
elutes from a gas chromatographic column, errors can occur because the
components of a sample can elute at a different time than the standards of
the same boiling point.
Another aspect of volatility, namely, the tendency for gasoline to vapor-
ize, can be expressed in terms of vapor-to-liquid ratio (V/L) at tempera-
tures approximating those found in critical parts of the gasoline system.
One standard test method (ASTM D-2533) allows the use of either of two
conﬁning ﬂuids, glycerin or mercury. Glycerin should be used as the con-
ﬁning ﬂuid only for hydrocarbon-only gasoline. Mercury must be used as
the conﬁning ﬂuid for gasoline-oxygenate blends and can also be used for
gasoline. An instrumental method that does not use a conﬁning ﬂuid can be
used for both gasoline and gasoline-oxygenate blends (ASTM D-5188).
A linear equation method and a nomograph method can be used for esti-
mating vapor-liquid equilibria of gasoline from vapor pressure and distilla-
tion test results (ASTM D-4814). However, these estimation methods are
not applicable to gasoline-oxygenate blends.
5.3.10. Water and Sediment
However, before any volatility tests are carried out it, all water must be
removed because the presence of more then 0.5% water in test samples of
crude can cause several problems during distillation procedures. Water has
a high heat of vaporization, necessitating the application of additional
thermal energy to the distillation ﬂask. Water is relatively easily super-
heated, and therefore excessive bumping can occur, leading to erroneous132 gasolinereadings, and the potential for destruction of the glass equipment is real.
Steam formed during distillation can act as a carrier gas, and high-boiling
point components may end up in the distillate ( steam distillation ).
Centrifugation can be used to remove water (and sediment) if the sample
is not a tight emulsion. Other methods that are used to remove water
include:
1. Heating in a pressure vessel to control loss of light ends,
2. Addition of calcium chloride as recommended in ASTM D-1160,
3. Addition of an azeotroping agent such as iso-propanol or n-butanol,
4. Removal of water in a preliminary low-efﬁciency or ﬂash distillation
followed by reblending the hydrocarbon that codistills with the water
into the sample (IP 74), and 
5. Separation of the water from the hydrocarbon distillate by freezing.
Water is a contaminant in gasoline and should be measured with the Karl
Fischer method (ASTM E-203, ASTM D-1364, ASTM D-1744, ASTM D-
4377,ASTM D-4928,ASTM D-6304), by distillation using a Dean and Stark
condenser (ASTM D-4006) (Fig. 5.3), or by centrifuging (ASTM D-96) and
excluded by relevant drying methods.test methods 133
Figure 5.3. Dean and Stark adaptor on the bottom of a condenser Tests should also be carried out for sediment if the gasoline has been
subjected to events (such as oxidation) that could lead to sediment forma-
tion and instability of the gasoline and the resulting products. Test methods"
"are available for the determination of sediment by extraction (ASTM D-
473, IP 285) or by membrane ﬁltration (ASTM D-4807, IP 286) and the
determination of simultaneously sediment with water by centrifugation
(ASTM D-96, ASTM D-1796, ASTM D-2709, ASTM D-4007, IP 373, IP
374).

A VIATION FUEL
6.1. INTRODUCTION
The term aviation fuel , as used in this text, is a collective term that includes
aviation gasoline and aviation gas turbine fuel as well as various types of 
jet fuel (Gruse and Stevens, 1960; Guthrie, 1967; Gottshall et al., 1973;
Weissermel and Arpe, 1978; Francis and Peters, 1980; Hoffman, 1983;
Austin, 1984; Chenier, 1992; Hoffman and McKetta, 1993; Hemighaus, G.
1998; Speight, 1999; Wolveridge, 2000). Aviation fuels consist of hydrocar-
bons, and sulfur-containing as well as oxygen-containing impurities are
limited strictly by speciﬁcation. Composition speciﬁcations usually state
that aviation fuel must consist entirely of hydrocarbons except for trace
amounts of approved additives.
The two basic types of jet fuels in general use are based on kerosene
(kerosene-type jet fuel) and gasoline (naphtha) (gasoline-type jet fuel).
Kerosene-type jet fuel is a modiﬁed development of the illuminating
kerosene originally used in gas turbine engines. Gasoline-type jet fuel has
a wider boiling range and includes some gasoline fractions. In addition, a
number of specialized fuel grades are required for use in high-performance
military aircraft.
Kerosene-type jet fuel is medium distillate used for aviation turbine
power units and usually has the same distillation characteristics and ﬂash
point as kerosene (between 150°C and 300°C but not generally above
250°C). In addition, this fuel has particular speciﬁcations (such as freezing
point) that are established by the International Air Transport Association
(IATA). On the other hand, aircraft gas turbine engines require a fuel with
properties different from those required for aviation gasoline (ASTM D-
1655). The major difference is that aircraft turbine engines require a fuel
with good combustion characteristics and high energy content. However, as
engine and fuel system designs have become more complicated, the fuel
speciﬁcations have become more varied and restrictive.
The ﬁrst aviation gas turbine engines were regarded as having noncriti-
cal fuel requirements. Ordinary illuminating kerosene was the original
development fuel, but the increased complexity in design of the engine has
required fuel speciﬁcation tests to be more complicated and numerous.
137Demands for improved performance, economy, and overhaul life will 
indirectly continue the trend toward additional tests.
6.2. PRODUCTION AND PROPERTIES
Aviation fuels have a narrower distillation range than motor gasoline, and
the octane ratings of aviation gasoline and motor gasoline are not compa-
rable because of the different test methods used to rate the two types of"
"fuels. In addition, motor gasoline has a shorter storage stability lifetime than
aviation gasoline and can form gum deposits that can induce poor mixture
distribution and valve sticking.
Furthermore, the higher aromatics content and the possible presence of
oxygenates in motor gasoline can induce solvent characteristics that are
unsuitable for seals, gaskets, fuel lines, and some fuel tank materials in air-
craft. Motor gasoline may also contain additives that could be incompati-
ble with certain in-service aviation turbine fuel (ASTM D-4054, ASTM
D-4307). For example, alcohols or other oxygenates can increase the ten-
dency for the fuel to hold water, either in solution or in suspension.
Aviation gasoline , for aviation piston engines, is produced from petro-
leum distillation fractions containing lower-boiling hydrocarbons that are
usually found in straight-run naphtha. These fractions have high contents
of iso-pentanes and iso-hexane and provide needed volatility as well as
high octane numbers. Higher-boiling iso-parafﬁns are provided by aviation
alkylate, which consists mostly of branched octanes. Aromatics, such as
benzene, toluene, and xylene, are obtained from processes such as catalytic
reforming.
To increase the proportion of higher-boiling octane components, such as
aviation alkylate and xylenes, the proportion of lower-boiling components
must also be increased to maintain the proper volatility. Iso-pentane and,
to some extent, iso-hexane are the lower-boiling components used and can
be separated from naphtha by superfractionators or synthesized from the
normal hydrocarbons by isomerization. In general, most aviation gasoline
is made by blending a selected straight-run naphtha fraction (aviation base
stock) with iso-pentane and aviation alkylate.
Aviation gasoline has an octane number suited to the engine, a freezing
point of -60°C, and a distillation range usually within the limits of 30°C
(86°F) and 180°C (356°F).Aviation gasoline speciﬁcations generally contain
three main sections covering suitability, composition, and chemical and
physical requirements. In addition, gasoline type jet fuel includes all light
hydrocarbon fractions for use in aviation turbine power units and distills
between 100°C (212°F) and 250°C (482°F). It is obtained by blending
kerosene and gasoline or naphtha in such a way that the aromatic content138 aviation fueldoes not exceed 25%v/v and the vapor pressure is between 13.7 kPa (2 psi)
and 20.6 kPa (3psi).
Aviation turbine fuels are manufactured predominantly from straight-run
kerosene or kerosene-naphtha blends in the case of wide-cut fuels that are
produced from the atmospheric distillation of crude oil. Straight-run
kerosene from low-sulfur (sweet) crude oil will meet all the requirements
of the jet fuel speciﬁcation without further reﬁnery processing, but for the
majority of feedstocks, the kerosene fraction will contain trace constituents
that must be removed by hydrotreating (hydroﬁning) or by a chemical
sweetening process (Speight, 2000).
Traditionally, jet fuel has been manufactured only from straight-run com-
ponents, but in recent years, however, hydrocracking processes (Speight,
1999; Speight and Ozum, 2002) have been introduced that produce high-
quality kerosene fractions ideal for jet fuel blending.
Because of the international nature of aviation activities, the technical
requirements of all the western speciﬁcations are virtually identical, and
only differences of a minor nature exist between the various speciﬁcations
(ASTM D-910).
6.3. TEST METHODS
Speciﬁcations covering the various grades have been drawn up by a number
of bodies, and these have been reissued from time to time as engine require-
ments have changed. No signiﬁcant changes have now occurred in these
speciﬁcations for a number of years, except for the gradual reduction in the
number of grades covered.
The requirements for jet fuels stress a different combination of proper-
ties and tests than those required for aviation gasoline (ASTM D-1655).
The same basic controls are needed for such properties as storage stability
and corrosivity, but the gasoline antiknock tests are replaced by tests
directly and indirectly controlling energy content and combustion charac-
teristics. However, as with other petroleum products, application of sam-
pling protocols (ASTM D-3700, ASTM D-4057, ASTM D-4177, ASTM
D-4306, ASTM D-5842) is of prime importance.
6.3.1. Acidity
Acidity is a property usually found in lubricating oil (ASTM D-664, ASTM
D-974, ASTM D-3339, ASTM D-5770, IP 139, IP 177, IP 431); acidic com-
pounds can also be present in aviation turbine fuels either because of the
acid treatment during the reﬁning process or because of naturally occur-
ring organic acids. Acidity is an undesirable property because of the pos-test methods 139sibility of metal corrosion and impairment of water separation characteris-
tics of the fuel.
In the test method for the determination of the acidity in an aviation"
"turbine fuel (ASTM D-3242, IP 354), a sample is dissolved in a solvent
mixture (toluene plus isopropyl alcohol and a small amount of water) and
under a stream of nitrogen is titrated with standard alcoholic potassium
hydroxide to the color change from orange in acid to green in base via added
indicator p-naphtholbenzein solution.
6.3.2. Additives
The various approved additives for jet fuels include oxidation inhibitors 
to improve storage stability, copper deactivators to neutralize the known
adverse effect of copper on fuel stability, and corrosion inhibitors intended
for the protection of storage tanks and pipelines.An anti-icing additive (fuel
system icing inhibitor) is called for in many military fuels, and a static dis-
sipator additive (antistatic additive) may be required to minimize ﬁre and
explosion risks due to electrostatic discharges in installations and equip-
ment during pumping operations. Details of the various approved additives
(mandatory or optional) are included in the individual speciﬁcations; more-
over, the additives must be compatible with the fuel (ASTM D-4054).
Only a limited number of additives are permitted in aviation fuels, and
for each fuel grade the type and concentration are closely controlled by the
appropriate fuel speciﬁcations. Additives may be included for a variety of
reasons, but in every case the speciﬁcations deﬁne the requirements as
follows:
1. Mandatory: must be present between minimum and maximum limits.
2. Permitted: may be added up to a maximum limit.
3. Optional: may be added only within speciﬁed limits.
4. Not allowed: additives not listed in the speciﬁcations.
Although the type and amount of each additive permitted in aviation
fuels are strictly limited to color dye, antioxidant, metal deactivator, corro-
sion inhibitor, fuel system icing inhibitor, static dissipator, and lubricity
additive, test methods for checking the concentration present are not spec-
iﬁed in every case. In some cases tests to determine the additive content (or
its effect) are called for, but in other cases a written statement of its origi-
nal addition (e.g., at the reﬁnery) is accepted as adequate evidence of its
presence.
After the speciﬁed amounts of color dyes have been added to aviation
gasoline the color is normally only checked visually (by inspection), through140 aviation fuelthe Saybolt method (ASTM D-l56). In the past jet fuel color has also been
speciﬁed by the Lovibond method (IP 17), as currently used for the color
of dyed aviation gasoline, although color by inspection might, but not
always, be considered adequate.
After the required amounts of antioxidant, metal deactivator, or corro-
sion inhibitor have been added to aviation fuels it is not normal to carry
out any checks on the concentrations, and no test methods are included in
speciﬁcations for this purpose. Occasionally a need arises to determine the
amount of corrosion inhibitor remaining in a fuel, and several analytical
methods have been developed, none of which has yet been standardized.
Fuel system icing inhibitor (FSII) used in jet fuels can be lost by evapo-
ration and is also lost rapidly into any water that may contact the fuel during
transportation. Routine checks must therefore be made on the icing
inhibitor content of the fuel, right up to the point of delivery to aircraft in
some instances (IP 277), but for routine test purposes a simpler colorimet-
ric version of this test is commonly used.
Many fuel speciﬁcations require the use of static dissipator additive to
improve safety in fuel handling. In such cases the speciﬁcation deﬁnes both
minimum and maximum electrical conductivity; the minimum level ensures
adequate charge relaxation whereas the maximum prevents too high a con-
ductivity, because this can upset some capacitance-type fuel gauges in air-
craft (ASTM D-2624, ASTM D-4308, IP 274). The standard test methods
(ASTM D-2624, IP 274) employ an immersible conductivity cell and ﬁeld
meter intended for measuring the conductivity of fuel in storage tanks.
As a valuable step toward rationalizing the approval procedure for 
aviation fuel additives, guidelines are available (ASTM D-1655, ASTM D-
4054).Tests are available for measuring or specifying additives such as color
dyes (ASTM D-156, ASTM D-2392, ASTM D-5386, IP 17), corrosion
inhibitors (often measured by the corrosivity of the fuel—ASTM D-130,
ASTM D-5968, IP 154), lubricity (ASTM D-5001), fuel system icing
inhibitors (ASTM D-910, ASTM D-4171, ASTM D-5006, IP 277), and static
dissipator additives (ASTM D-2624, ASTM D-4865, IP 274).
6.3.3. Caloriﬁc Value (Heat of Combustion)
The heat of combustion (ASTM D-240, ASTM D-1405, ASTM D-2382,
ASTM D-3338, ASTM D-4529, ASTM D-4809, ASTM D-6446, IP 12) is a
direct measure of fuel energy content and is determined as the quantity of
heat liberated by the combustion of a unit quantity of fuel with oxygen in
a standard bomb calorimeter. This fuel property affects the economics of"
"engine performance, and the speciﬁed minimum value is a compromise
between the conﬂicting requirements of maximum fuel availability and
good fuel consumption characteristics.test methods 141As a general guideline, the heat of combustion is on the order of
18,000–21,000 Btu/lb (10,000–11,600 cal/g) for petroleum, on the order 
of 20,000–20,700 Btu/lb (11,100–11,500cal/g) for gasoline, on the order of
19,000–20,200 Btu/lb (10,500–1,200 cal/g) for kerosene and similar fuels, and
on the order of 17,300–20,200 Btu/lb (9,600–11,200 cal/gm) for fuel oil.
When an experimental determination of heat of combustion is not avail-
able and cannot be made conveniently, an estimate might be considered sat-
isfactory (ASTM D-6446). In this test method, the net heat of combustion
is calculated from the density and sulfur and hydrogen content, but this cal-
culation is justiﬁable only when the fuel belongs to a well-deﬁned class for
which a relationship between these quantities has been derived from accu-
rate experimental measurements on representative samples. Thus the
hydrogen content (ASTM D-1217, ASTM D-1298, ASTM D-3701, ASTM
D-4052, ASTM D-4808, ASTM D-5291 IP 160, IP 365), density (ASTM D-
129, ASTM D-1250, ASTM D-1266, ASTM D-2622, ASTM D-3120, IP 61,
IP 107), and sulfur content (ASTM D-2622, ASTM D-3120, ASTM D-3246,
ASTM D-4294,ASTM D-5453,ASTM D-5623, IP 336, IP 373) of the sample
are determined by experimental test methods and the net heat of combus-
tion is calculated using the values obtained by these test methods based on
reported correlations.
A simple equation for calculating the heat of combustion is:
Q=12,400 – 2,100 d2
where Qis the heat of combustion and dis the speciﬁc gravity. However,
the accuracy of any method used to calculate such a property is not guar-
anteed, and the result can only be used as a guide to or approximation of
the measured value.
An alternative criterion of energy content is the aniline gravity product
(AGP), which is related to caloriﬁc value (ASTM D-1405, IP 193). The
aniline gravity product is the product of the API gravity (ASTM D-287,
ASTM D-1298) and the aniline point of the fuel (ASTM D-611, IP 2). The
aniline point is the lowest temperature at which the fuel is miscible with an
equal volume of aniline and is inversely proportional to the aromatic
content. The relationship between the aniline gravity product and caloriﬁc
value is given in the method. In another method (ASTM D-3338), the heat
of combustion is calculated from the fuel density, the 10%, 50%, and 90%
distillation temperatures, and the aromatic content. However, neither
method is legally acceptable, and other methods (ASTM D-240, ASTM D-
1655, ASTM D-4809) are preferred.
Jet fuels of the same class can vary widely in their burning quality as
measured by carbon deposition, smoke formation, and ﬂame radiation.This
is a function of hydrocarbon composition—parafﬁns have excellent burning142 aviation fuelproperties, in contrast to those of the aromatics (particularly the polynu-
clear aromatic hydrocarbons). As a control measure the smoke point test
(ASTM D-l322, IP 57) gives the maximum smokeless ﬂame height in 
millimeters at which the fuel will burn in a wick-fed lamp under prescribed
conditions. The combustion performance of wide-cut fuels correlates well
with smoke point when a fuel volatility factor is included, because carbon
formation tends to increase with boiling point. A minimum smoke volatil-
ity index (SVI) value is speciﬁed and is deﬁned as:
SVI =smoke point +0.42 (percent distilled below 204°C/400°F).
However, the smoke point is not always a reliable criterion of combustion
performance and should be used in conjunction with other properties.
Various alternative laboratory test methods have previously been speciﬁed
such as the lamp burning test (ASTM D-187, IP 10) and a limit on the
polynuclear aromatic content (ASTM D-1840), as well as the luminometer
number (ASTM D-l740).
The test for luminometer number (ASTM D-l740) was developed
because certain designs of jet engine have the potential for a shortened
combustion chamber life because of high liner temperatures caused by
radiant heat from luminous ﬂames.The test apparatus is a smoke point lamp
modiﬁed to include a photoelectric cell for ﬂame radiation measurement
and a thermocouple to measure temperature rise across the ﬂame. The fuel
luminometer number (LN) is expressed on an arbitrary scale on which
values of 0 to 100 are given to the reference fuels tetralin and iso-octane,
respectively.
6.3.4. Composition
The ﬁrst level of compositional information is group-type totals as deduced
by adsorption chromatography (ASTM D-1319, IP 156). This method is
applied to data related to the volume percent saturates, oleﬁns, and aro-
matics in materials that boil below 315°C (600°F). This temperature range
includes jet fuels (but not all diesel fuel), most of which have an end point
above 315°C."
"Aviation gasoline consists substantially of hydrocarbons; sulfur-contain-
ing and oxygen-containing impurities are strictly limited by speciﬁcation,
and only certain additives are permitted. Straight-run gasoline from crude
oil, containing varying proportions of parafﬁns, naphthenes, and aromatics,
invariably lacks the high proportion of branch chain parafﬁns ( iso-
parafﬁns) required to produce the higher-quality aviation fuels.
Unsaturated hydrocarbons (oleﬁns) are relatively unstable and give rise
to excessive gum formation. Only the lower grades of fuel can include atest methods 143proportion of straight-run gasoline, and the higher grades consist mainly of
iso-parafﬁns with a small amount of aromatic material to improve the rich
mixture antiknock performance. The main component of these high-grade
fuels is iso-octane produced in the alkylation process by reaction of reﬁn-
ery butenes with iso-butane over the acid catalysts. To meet the volatility
requirements of the ﬁnal blend, there is added a small proportion of iso-
pentane, obtained by superfractionation of light straight-run gasoline. The
aromatic component required to improve rich mixture rating is now usually
a catalytic reformate, and the amount added is indirectly limited by the
gravimetric caloriﬁc value requirement.
Jet fuels consist entirely of hydrocarbons except for trace quantities 
of sulfur compounds and approved additives. Jet fuels are produced, for
example, by blending straight-run distillate components, and oleﬁns are
limited by speciﬁcation (ASTM D-l319, IP 156) or by the bromine number
(ASTM D-1159, ASTM D-2710, IP 130).
The bromine number is the number of grams of bromine that will react
with 100 g of the sample under the test conditions. The magnitude of
bromine number is an indication of the quantity of bromine-reactive con-
stituents and is not an identiﬁcation of constituents. It is used as a measure
of aliphatic unsaturation in petroleum samples and percentage of oleﬁns in
petroleum distillates boiling up to approximately 315°C (600°F). In the test,
a known weight of the sample dissolved in a speciﬁed solvent maintained
at 0–5°C (32–41°F) is titrated with standard bromide-bromate solution.
Determination of the end point is method dependent.
Because the aromatic hydrocarbon content of aviation turbine fuels
affects their combustion characteristics and smoke forming tendencies, the
amounts of aromatics (ASTM D-1319, IP 156) are limited. Aromatic con-
stituents also increase the luminosity of the combustion ﬂame (ASTM D-
l740), which can adversely affect the life of the combustion chamber.
The aromatics content of aviation turbine fuel is included in the aviation
turbine fuel speciﬁcation (ASTM D-1655). Another test method for aro-
matics content (ASTM D-5186) involves the injection of a small aliquot of
the fuel sample onto a packed silica adsorption column and elution with
supercritical carbon dioxide as the mobile phase. Mono- and polynuclear
aromatics in the sample are separated from nonaromatics and detected with
a ﬂame ionization detector. The chromatographic areas corresponding to
the mono- and polynuclear and nonaromatic components are determined,
and the mass percent content of each of these groups is calculated by area
normalization. The results obtained by this method are at least statistically
more precise than those obtained by other test methods (ASTM D-1319,
ASTM D-2425).
Although the boiling range of aviation gasoline will differ from that of
automobile gasoline, many of the tests designated for automotive gasoline144 aviation fuel(Chapter 5) can also be applied to the determination of the aromatic con-
stituents of aviation gasoline (ASTM D-86, ASTM D-1319, ASTM D-4420,
ASTM D-5443, ASTM D-5580, ASTM D-5769, ASTM D-5986, IP 123 
IP 156).
The percentage of aromatic hydrogen atoms and aromatic carbon atoms
can be determined by low-resolution magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(ASTM D-3701, ASTM D-4808) and by high-resolution nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (ASTM D-5292). The data produced by magnetic
resonance spectroscopic methods are not equivalent to mass- or volume-
percent aromatics determinations by the chromatographic methods
because these methods determine the mass- or volume-percentage of mol-
ecules that have one or more aromatic rings. Chromatographic methods can
also include alkyl side chains (on aromatic rings) within the aromatics frac-
tion. Naphthalene content is an important quality parameter of jet fuel and
is determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry (ASTM D-1840).
As with other fuels, heteroatoms, mainly sulfur and nitrogen compounds,
cannot be ignored, and well-established methods are available for deter-
mining the concentration of these elements. The combination of gas chro-
matography with element-selective detection gives information about the
distribution of the element. In addition, many individual heteroatomic com-
pounds can be determined."
"The principal non-hydrocarbon components are sulfur compounds that
vary with the source of the crude oil. The sulfur content of a feedstock or
fuel is determined by burning a sample of the fuel and determining the
amount of sulfur oxides that are formed (ASTM D-l26, IP 107). Generally,
current desulfurization technologies are capable of reducing sulfur to the
desired levels (ASTM D-1266, ASTM D-1552, ASTM D-2622, ASTM 
D-4294, IP 107). High levels of sulfur compounds adversely affect the fuel
performance in the combustion chamber, and the presence of large amounts
of oxides of sulfur in the combustion gases is undesirable because of pos-
sible corrosion.
Some sulfur compounds can also have a corroding action on the various
metals of the engine system, varying according to the chemical type of sulfur
compound present. Fuel corrosivity is assessed by its action on copper and
is controlled by the copper strip test (ASTM D-130, IP 154), which speci-
ﬁes that not more than a slight stain shall be observed when the polished
strip is immersed in fuel heated for 2h in a bomb at 100°C (212°F). This
particular method is not always capable of reﬂecting fuel corrosivity toward
other fuel system metals. For example, service experience with corrosion of
silver components in certain engine fuel systems led to the development 
of a silver corrosion test (IP 227). The mercaptan sulfur content (ASTM 
D-1219, ASTM D-3227, IP 104, IP 342) of jet fuels is limited because of
objectionable odor, adverse effect on certain fuel system elastomers, andtest methods 145corrosiveness toward fuel system metals. As an alternative to determining
the mercaptan content, a negative result by the Doctor test (ASTM D-484,
ASTM D-4952, IP 30) is usually acceptable.
Oxygenated constituents present as acidic compounds such as phenols
and naphthenic acids are controlled in different speciﬁcations by a variety
of acidity tests.The total acidity (ASTM D-974, IP 139, IP 273) is still widely
used but has been found to be insufﬁciently sensitive to detect trace acidic
materials that can adversely affect the water-separating properties of 
fuel. Oxygen-containing impurities in the form of gum are limited by the
existent gum method (ASTM D-381, IP 131) and potential gum method
(ASTM D-873, IP 138). With respect to aviation turbine fuels, large quan-
tities of gum are indicative of contamination of fuel by higher-boiling oils
(ASTM D-86, IP 123) or by particulate matter (ASTM D-2276, ASTM D-
5452, ASTM D-6217, IP 216, IP 415). In the existent gum test for aviation
fuel, a measured quantity of fuel is evaporated under controlled conditions
of temperature and ﬂow of air or steam. The residue is weighed and
reported.
Control of dirt and other particles involves use of a membrane ﬁltration
method (ASTM D-2276, IP 216) in which the dirt retained by ﬁltration of
a sample through a cellulose membrane is expressed as weight per unit
volume of the fuel. This test provides ﬁeld quality control of dirt content
and can be supplemented by a visual assessment of membrane appearance
after test against color standards (ASTM D-3830). However, no direct rela-
tionship exists between particulate content weight and membrane color,
and ﬁeld experience is required to assess the results by either method.
Jet fuel is tested for being clear and bright by visual examination of a
sample (ASTM D-4176).
Another contamination problem is that of microbiological growth activ-
ity, which can give rise to service troubles of various types. This problem
can generally be avoided by the adoption of good housekeeping techniques
by all concerned, but major incidents in recent years have led to the devel-
opment of several microbiological monitoring tests for aviation fuel. In one
of these tests, fuel is ﬁltered through a sterile membrane that is subse-
quently cultured for microbiological growths; other tests use various tech-
niques to detect the presence of viable microbiological matter, but none of
the tests has yet been standardized.
Correlative methods are also available for application to aviation fuels.
Such methods include the use of viscosity-temperature charts (ASTM D-
341), calculation of the cetane index (ASTM D-976, ASTM D-4737), cal-
culation of the viscosity index (ASTM D-2270), calculation of the viscosity
gravity constant (ASTM D-2501), calculation of the true vapor pressure
(ASTM D-2889), and estimation of the heat of combustion (ASTM 
D-3338).146 aviation fuel6.3.5. Density (Speciﬁc Gravity)
The density (speciﬁc gravity) of a fuel is a measure of the mass per unit
volume and can be determined directly with calibrated glass hydrometers
(Chapters 4 and 5).
Density (speciﬁc gravity) (ASTM D-1298, IP 160) is an important prop-
erty of aviation fuel as an indicator of the total energy content of a fuel
uplift on a weight and/or volume basis. Variation in density is controlled
within broad limits to ensure engine control. Both fuel speciﬁc gravity and"
"caloriﬁc value vary somewhat according to crude source, parafﬁnic fuels
having a slightly lower speciﬁc gravity but higher gravimetric caloriﬁc value
than those from naphthenic crude oils.
Density is used in fuel load calculations, because weight or volume fuel
limitations (or both) may be necessary according to the type of aircraft and
ﬂight pattern involved. In most cases the volume of fuel that can be carried
is limited by tank capacity, and to achieve maximum range a high-density
fuel is preferred because this will provide the greatest heating value per
gallon (liter) of fuel. The caloriﬁc (heating) value per unit weight in kg) of
fuel decreases with increasing density, and when the weight of fuel that can
be carried is limited it may be advantageous to use a lower-density fuel,
provided adequate tank capacity is available.
In the U.S. it is more common to specify fuel density in terms of the API
gravity (ASTM D-287):
API gravity, degrees =[141.5/(speciﬁc gravity 60°/60°F)] -131.5
Aviation fuel might be expected to have an API gravity in the range of 57
to 35 (speciﬁc gravity: 0.75 to 0.85, respectively).
6.3.6. Flash Point
The ﬂash point test is a guide to the ﬁre hazard associated with the use of
the fuel; the ﬂash point can be determined by several test methods, and the
results are not always strictly comparable.
The minimum ﬂash point is usually deﬁned by the Abel method (IP 170),
except for high-ﬂash kerosene, where the Pensky–Martens method (ASTM
D-93, IP 34) is speciﬁed. The TAG method (ASTM D-56) is used for both
the minimum and maximum limits, whereas certain military speciﬁcations
also give minimum limits by the Pensky–Martens method (ASTM D-93, IP
34). The Abel method (IP 170) can give results up to 2–3°C (3–5°F) lower
than the TAG method (ASTM D-56).
Similarly, for jet fuel the ﬂash point is a guide to the ﬁre hazard associ-
ated with the fuel and can be determined by the same test methods as notedtest methods 147above (ASTM D-56, ASTM D-93, ASTM D-3828, IP 34, IP 170, IP 303),
except for high-ﬂash kerosene, where the method (ASTM D-93, IP 34) is
speciﬁed.
It should be noted that the various ﬂash point methods can yield dif-
ferent numerical results, and in the case of the two most commonly used
methods (Abel and TAG) it has been found that the former (IP 170) can
give results up to 1–2°C lower than the latter method (ASTM D-56).
Setaﬂash (ASTM D-3828/ IP 303) results are generally very close to Abel
values.
6.3.7. Freezing Point
The freezing point of aviation fuel is an index of the lowest temperature of
its utility for the speciﬁed applications. Aviation fuels must have acceptable
freezing point and low-temperature pumpability characteristics so that 
adequate fuel ﬂow to the engine is maintained at high altitude; this is 
a requirement of aviation speciﬁcations. (ASTM D-910, ASTM D-1655).
Maximum freezing point values are speciﬁed for all types of aviation fuel
as a guide to the lowest temperature at which the fuel can be used without
risk of the separation of solid hydrocarbons. The solidiﬁed hydrocarbons
could lead to clogging of fuel lines or fuel ﬁlters and loss in available fuel
load due to retention of solidiﬁed fuel in the tanks. The freezing point of
the fuel (typically in the range –40 to –65°C, –40 to –85°F) must always be
lower than the minimum operational fuel temperature. The freezing point
speciﬁcation is retained as a speciﬁcation property to predict and safeguard
high-altitude performance 
Three test methods are available for determination of the freezing point.
All three methods have been found to give equivalent results. However,
when a speciﬁcation calls for a speciﬁc test, only that test must be used.
In the ﬁrst test (ASTM D-2386, IP 16), a measured fuel sample is placed
in a jacketed sample tube also holding a thermometer and a stirrer. The
tube is placed in a vacuum ﬂask containing the cooling medium. Various
coolants used are acetone, methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or isopropyl
alcohol, solid carbon dioxide, or liquid nitrogen. As the sample cools, it is
continuously stirred. The temperature at which the hydrocarbon crystals
appear is recorded. The jacketed sample is removed from the coolant and
allowed to warm, under continuous stirring. The temperature at which the
crystals completely disappear is recorded.
In the second test (ASTM D-5901, IP 434), an automated optical method
is used for the temperature range to –70°C (–94°F). In this method, a 
25-min portion of the fuel is placed in a test chamber that is cooled while
continuously being stirred and monitored by an optical system. The 
temperature of the specimen is measured with an electronic measuring148 aviation fueldevice, and the temperatures when crystals ﬁrst appear and then, on
warming, disappear are recorded.
In the third method (ASTM D-5972, IP 435), an automated phase tran-
sition method is used in the temperature range –80 to 20°C (–112°F to"
"68°F). In this test, a specimen is cooled at a rate of 15 ± 5°C/min while con-
tinuously being illuminated by a light source. The specimen is continuously
monitored by an array of optical detectors for the ﬁrst formation of solid
hydrocarbon crystals. After that the specimen is warmed at the rate of 10
± 0.5°C/min until all crystals return to the liquid phase, and that tempera-
ture is also recorded.
An alternative method of deﬁning the low-temperature pumpability
limits of jet fuel, the cold ﬂow test (IP 217), is also available but may not
give an adequate safety margin for the behavior of the fuel in service.
6.3.8. Knock and Antiknock Properties
The various fuel grades are classiﬁed by their antiknock quality character-
istics as determined in single-cylinder laboratory engines. Knock, or deto-
nation, in an engine is a form of abnormal combustion where the air/fuel
charge in the cylinder ignites spontaneously in a localized area instead 
of being consumed progressively by the spark-initiated ﬂame front. Such
knocking combustion can damage the engine and give serious power loss
if allowed to persist, and the various grades are designed to guarantee
knock-free operation for a range of engines from those used in light air-
craft up to high-powered transport and military types.
The antiknock ratings of aviation gasoline are determined in standard
laboratory engines by matching their performance against reference blends
of pure iso-octane and n-heptane. Fuel rating is expressed as an octane
number (ON), which is deﬁned as the percentage of iso-octane in the
matching reference blend. Fuels of higher performance than iso-octane 
(100 ON) are tested against blends of iso-octane with various amounts of
antiknock additive. The rating of such fuel is expressed as a performance
number (PN), deﬁned as the maximum knock-free power output obtained
from the fuel expressed as a percentage of the power obtainable on 
iso-octane.
The antiknock rating of fuel varies according to the air-fuel mixture
strength used, and this fact is used in deﬁning the performance require-
ments of the higher-grade aviation fuels. As mixture strength is increased
(richened), the additional fuel acts as an internal coolant and suppresses
knocking combustion, thus permitting a higher power rating to be obtained.
Because maximum power output is the prime requirement of an engine
under rich takeoff conditions, the rich mixture performance of a fuel is
determined in a special supercharged single-cylinder engine (ASTM D-909,test methods 149IP 119); weak mixture performance is also determined (ASTM D 2700,
IP 236).
The higher grades of fuel are thus classiﬁed by their speciﬁed antiknock
ratings under both sets of test conditions. For example, 100/130 grade fuel
has an antiknock quality of 100 minimum by the weak mixture test proce-
dure and 130 minimum by the rich mixture procedure. Octane numbers are
used to specify ratings of 100 and below, whereas performance numbers are
used above 100.
6.3.9. Pour Point
The pour point of a petroleum product is an index of the lowest tempera-
ture at which the product will ﬂow under speciﬁed conditions. Pour point
data can be used to supplement other measurements of cold ﬂow behavior
(such as the freezing point).
In the original (and still widely used) test for pour point (ASTM D-97,
IP 15), a sample is cooled at a speciﬁed rate and examined at intervals of
3°C (5.4°F) for ﬂow characteristics. The lowest temperature at which the
movement of the oil is observed is recorded as the pour point. A later test
method (ASTM D-5853) covers two procedures for the determination of
the pour point of crude oils down to –36°C. One method provides a measure
of the maximum (upper) pour point temperature. The second method
measures the minimum (lower) pour point temperature. In these methods,
the test specimen is cooled (after preliminary heating) at a speciﬁed rate
and examined at intervals of 3°C (5.4°F) for ﬂow characteristics. Again, the
lowest temperature at which movement of the test specimen is observed is
recorded as the pour point.
In any determination of the pour point, a petroleum product that con-
tains wax produces an irregular ﬂow behavior when the wax begins to sep-
arate. This type of product petroleum possesses viscosity relationships that
are difﬁcult to predict in operating conditions. This complex behavior may
limit the value of pour point data, but laboratory pumpability tests (ASTM
D-3245, IP 230) are available that, with the freezing point (ASTM D-2386,
ASTM D-5901, ASTM D-5972, IP 16, IP 434, IP 435), give an estimate of
minimum handling temperature and minimum line or storage temperature.
6.3.10. Storage Stability
Aviation fuel must retain its required properties for long periods of storage
in all kinds of climates. Unstable fuels oxidize and form oxidation products
that remain as a resinous solid or gum on induction manifolds, carburetors,"
"and valves as the fuel is evaporated. Hence, there is a limitation of oleﬁns
in the fuel; they are extremely reactive and form resinous products readily.150 aviation fuelThus formation of this undesirable gum is strictly limited and is assessed by
the existent and accelerated (or potential) gum tests.
The existent gum value (ASTM D-381, IP 131) is the gum actually
present in the fuel at the time of test and is measured as the weight of
residue obtained after controlled evaporation of a standard volume of fuel.
The accelerated gum test (ASTM D-873, IP 138) is a safeguard of storage
stability and predicts the possibility of gum forming during protracted
storage and decomposition of the antiknock additive. In this test, the fuel
is heated for 16 h with oxygen under pressure in a bomb at 100°C (212°F)
and then both the gum content and amount of precipitate are measured.
Another test used for determining the extent of oxidation of aviation
fuels is the determination of the hydroperoxide number (ASTM D-6447)
and the peroxide number (ASTM D-3703). Deterioration of aviation fuel
results in the formation of the peroxides as well as other oxygen-contain-
ing compounds ,and these numbers are indications of the quantity of oxi-
dizing constituents present in the sample as determined by measurement
of the compounds that will oxidize potassium iodide.
The determination of hydroperoxide number is signiﬁcant because of the
adverse effect of hydroperoxides on certain elastomers in the fuel systems.
This method (ASTM D-6447) measures the same peroxide species,primarily
the hydroperoxides in aviation fuels. This test method does not use the
ozone-depleting substance 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-triﬂuoroethane (ASTM D-
3703) and is applicable to any water-insoluble, organic ﬂuid, particularly
diesel fuels, gasoline, and kerosene. In this method, a quantity of sample is
contacted with aqueous potassium iodide (KI) solution in the presence of
acid.The hydroperoxides present are reduced by potassium iodide,liberating
an equivalent amount of iodine, which is quantiﬁed by voltametric analysis.
The determination of peroxide number of aviation turbine fuel is impor-
tant because of the adverse effects of peroxides on certain elastomers in
the fuel system. In the test, the sample is dissolved (unlike ASTM D-6447)
in 1,1,2-trichloro-l,2,2-triﬂuoroethane and is contacted within an aqueous
potassium iodide solution. The peroxides present are reduced by the potas-
sium iodide, whereupon an equivalent amount of iodine is released that is
titrated with standard sodium thiosulfate solution and a starch indicator.
Other tests for storage stability include determination of color forma-
tion and sediment (ASTM D-4625, ASTM D-5304) in which reactivity to
oxygen at high temperatures is determined by the amount of sediment for-
mation as well as any color changes.
6.3.11. Thermal Stability
Although the conventional (storage) stability of aviation fuel has long been
deﬁned and controlled by the existent and accelerated gum tests, anothertest methods 151test is required to measure the stability of a fuel to the thermal stresses that
can arise during sustained supersonic ﬂight and in some high-subsonic
applications.
In high-speed ﬂight, the fuel is subjected to considerable heat input due
to kinetic heating of the airframe and also to the use of the bulk fuel as a
coolant for engine oil, hydraulic and air conditioning equipment, etc. Con-
sequently, fuel for supersonic ﬂight must perform satisfactorily at temper-
atures up to about 250°C (480°F) without formation of lacquer and deposits
that can adversely affect the efﬁciency of heat exchangers, metering devices,
fuel ﬁlters, and injector nozzles. The initial problem was that of reduced
overhaul life in military engines due to high fuel system temperatures
upstream of the injector nozzles, giving rise to deposit formation.
Hence the application of the fuel coker test (ASTM D-l660, IP 197) for
assessing the tendency of jet fuels to deposit thermal decomposition prod-
ucts in fuel systems. In this test, fuel is pumped through a preheater tube
assembly representing fuel/oil heat exchange systems and then through a
sintered stainless steel ﬁlter representing nozzles and ﬁne oriﬁces where
fuel degradation products could become trapped. Fuel degradation is deter-
mined by pressure drop across the ﬁlter as well as by visual preheater tube
deposit condition and is rated numerically by application of the various
color standard tests (ASTM D-l56, ASTM D-848, ASTM D-1209, ASTM
D-1555, ASTM D-5386, IP 17).
The fuel coker test suffers from precision problems and has been largely
replaced by a test for the thermal oxidation stability of the fuel (ASTM D-
3241, IP 323) that overcomes the disadvantages of the fuel coker test in fuel
speciﬁcations.
6.3.12. Viscosity
Viscosity can signiﬁcantly affect the lubricating property of the fuel and can
have an inﬂuence on fuel pump service life."
"The viscosity (ASTM D-445, IP 71) of fuels at low temperature is limited
to ensure that adequate fuel ﬂow and pressure are maintained under all
operating conditions and that fuel injection nozzles and system controls will
operate down to design temperature conditions.
6.3.13. Volatility
Fuels must be easily convertible from storage in the liquid form to the vapor
phase in the engine to allow formation of the combustible air-fuel vapor
mixture. If gasoline fuel volatility were too low, liquid fuel would enter the
cylinder and wash lubricating oil from the walls and pistons and so lead to
increased engine wear; a further effect would be to cause dilution of the152 aviation fuelcrankcase oil; poor volatility can also give rise to poor distribution of
mixture strength between cylinders. Conversely, if volatility is too high, the
fuel can vaporize in the fuel tank and supply lines, giving undue venting
losses and the possibility of fuel starvation through vapor lock in the fuel
lines. The cooling effect due to rapid vaporization of excessive amounts of
highly volatile materials can also cause ice formation in the carburetor
under certain conditions of humidity and air temperature.
One of the most important physical parameters deﬁning these products
is their boiling range distribution (ASTM D-86, ASTM D-1078, ASTM D-
2887,ASTM D-2892, IP 123). However, this method is a low-efﬁciency, one-
theoretical plate distillation, and, although it has been adequate for product
speciﬁcation purposes, true boiling point (TBP) data are also required
(ASTM D-2887, ASTM D-2892).
In the simplest test method (ASTM D-86, IP 123) a 100-ml sample is dis-
tilled (manually or automatically) under prescribed conditions. Tempera-
tures and volumes of condensate are recorded at regular intervals from
which the boiling proﬁle is derived. Distillation points of 10%, 20%, 50%,
and 90% are speciﬁed in various ways to ensure that a properly balanced
fuel is produced with no undue proportion of light or heavy fractions. The
distillation end point excludes any heavy material that would give poor fuel
vaporization and ultimately affect engine combustion performance.
The determination of the boiling range distribution of aviation fuel by
gas chromatography (ASTM D-2887, ASTM D-3710) not only helps iden-
tify the constituents but also facilitates on-line controls at the reﬁnery. This
test method is designed to measure the entire boiling range of the fuel that
has either high or low Reid vapor pressure (ASTM D-323, IP 69). In either
method, the sample is injected into a gas chromatographic column that 
separates hydrocarbons in boiling point order. The column temperature 
is raised at a reproducible rate, and the area under the chromatogram is
recorded throughout the run. Calibration is performed with a known
mixture of hydrocarbons covering the expected boiling range of the sample.
Another method is described as a method for determining the carbon
number distribution (ASTM D-2887, IP 321), and the data derived by this
test method are essentially equivalent to that obtained by true boiling point
(TBP) distillation (ASTM D-2892). The sample is introduced into a gas
chromatographic column that separates hydrocarbons in boiling point
order.The column temperature is raised at a reproducible rate, and the area
under the chromatogram is recorded throughout the run. Boiling temper-
atures are assigned to the time axis from a calibration curve, obtained under
the same conditions by running a known mixture of hydrocarbons cover-
ing the boiling range expected in the sample. From these data, the boiling
range distribution may be obtained. However, this test method is limited 
to samples having a boiling range greater than 55°C (100°F) and having atest methods 153vapor pressure (ASTM D-323, ASTM D-4953, ASTM D-5190, ASTM D-
5191, ASTM D-5482, ASTM D-6377, ASTM D-6378, IP 69, IP 394) sufﬁ-
ciently low to permit sampling at ambient temperature.
6.3.14. Water
Because of their higher density and viscosity, jet fuels tend to retain ﬁne
particulate matter and water droplets in suspension for a much longer time
than aviation gasoline.
Jet fuels can also vary considerably in their tendency to pick up and
retain water droplets or to hold ﬁne water hazes in suspension depending
on the presence of trace surface-active impurities (surfactants). Some of
these materials (such as sulfonic and naphthenic acids and their sodium
salts) may originate from the crude source or from certain reﬁnery treat-
ing processes, whereas others may be picked up by contact with other prod-
ucts during transportation to the airﬁeld, particularly in multiproduct
pipelines. These latter materials may be natural contaminants from other
less highly reﬁned products (e.g., burning oils) or may consist of additives
from motor gasoline (such as glycol type anti-icing agents). It should be
noted that some of the additives speciﬁed for jet fuel use (e.g., corrosion"
"inhibitors and static dissipator additive) also have surface-active properties.
The presence of surfactants can also impair the performance of the
water-separating equipment (ﬁlter/separators) widely used throughout fuel
handling systems to remove the traces of free (undissolved) water, partic-
ularly at the later stages before delivery to aircraft.Very small traces of free
water can adversely affect jet engine and aircraft operations in several ways,
and the water retention and separating properties of jet fuels have become
a critical quality consideration in recent years.
Free water in jet fuels can be detected by the use of the Karl Fischer
titration method (ASTM D-1744) or by observing color changes when
chemicals go into aqueous solution (ASTM D-3240). The standard water
reaction test for jet fuel (ASTM D-1094, IP 289) is the same as for aviation
gasoline, but the interface and separation ratings are more critically deﬁned.
Test assessment is by subjective visual observation and, although quite
precise when made by an experienced operator, the test can cause rating
difﬁculties under borderline conditions. As a consequence, a more objec-
tive test, known as the water separometer test, is now included in many
speciﬁcations (ASTM D-2550).
In this test, fuel is mechanically mixed with a small quantity of water and
the resulting emulsion is passed through a miniature water coalescing pad
and then through a settling chamber followed by a photoelectric device that
measures the clarity of the efﬂuent fuel. A good fuel, which has easily shed
the entrained water, has a high rating of water separometer index-modiﬁed154 aviation fuel(WSIM) on a numerical scale directly related to the percentage of light
transmission.
There is also a water reaction test that is used to estimate, and prevent,
the addition of high-octane, water-soluble components such as ethyl alcohol
to aviation gasoline. The test method involves shaking 80 ml of fuel with
20 ml of water under standard conditions and observing phase volume
changes and interface condition.
It is speciﬁed that phase volume change shall not exceed 2 ml and that
the interface shall be substantially free from bubbles or scum, with sharp
separation of the phases without emulsion or precipitate within or upon
either layer. The long-established standard test methods for water reaction
(ASTM D-1094, ASTM D-3948, IP 2896) cover the volume change and the
interface condition, and special clauses have been included in most speciﬁ-
cations to cover the phase separation requirements.
In addition to appreciable amounts of water (ASTM D-4176, ASTM D-
4860), sediment can also occur and will cause fouling of the fuel handling
facilities and the fuel system. An accumulation of sediment in storage tanks
and on ﬁlter screens can obstruct the ﬂow of oil from the tank to the com-
bustor. A test method is available to determine the water and sediment in
fuels (ASTM D-2709). In this test, a sample of fuel is centrifuged at a rcf of
800 for 10 min at 21–32°C in a centrifuge tube readable to 0.005 ml and meas-
urable to 0.01 ml.After centrifugation, the volume of water and sediment that
has settled into the tip of the centrifuge tube is read to the nearest 0.005ml.

KEROSENE
7.1. INTRODUCTION
Kerosene (kerosine ), also called parafﬁn or parafﬁn oil, is a ﬂammable pale
yellow or colorless oily liquid with a characteristic odor intermediate in
volatility between gasoline and gas/diesel oil that distills between 125°C
(257°F) and 260°C (500°F) (Table 7.1; Fig. 7.1) (Gruse and Stevens, 1960;
Guthrie, 1967; Sefton, 1973; Weissermel and Arpe, 1978; Francis and Peters,
1980; Hoffman, 1983; Austin 1984; Chenier, 1992; Hoffman and McKetta,
1993; Hemighaus, G. 1998; Speight, 1999; Heinrich and Duée, 2000).
Kerosene is a reﬁned petroleum distillate that has a ﬂash point about
25∞C (77∞F) and is suitable for use as an illuminant when burned in a wide
lamp. The term kerosene is also too often incorrectly applied to various fuel
oils, but a fuel oil is actually any liquid or liquid petroleum product that
produces heat when burned in a suitable container or that produces power
when burned in an engine.
In the early years of the petroleum industry kerosene was its largest-
selling and most important product. The demand was such that many reﬁn-
ers, using a variety of crude oils, made as wide a distillation cut as possible
to increase its availability, thereby causing the product to have a danger-
ously low ﬂash point and to include undesirable higher-boiling fractions.
Burning oils are currently manufactured from carefully selected crude oils
or by the use of special reﬁning procedures, to give products of the requi-
site volatility and high burning quality.
7.2. PRODUCTION AND PROPERTIES
Kerosene was ﬁrst manufactured in the 1850s from coal tar, hence the name
coal oil as often applied to kerosene, but petroleum became the major
source after 1859. From that time, the kerosene fraction was, and has
remained, a distillation fraction of petroleum. However, the quantity and
quality vary with the type of crude oil, and although some crude oils yield
excellent kerosene quite simply, others produce kerosene that requires 
substantial reﬁning.
157Kerosene is less volatile than gasoline (boiling range approximately
140°C/285°F to 320°C/610°F) and is obtained by fractional distillation of
petroleum (Speight, 1999). To decrease smoke generation, parafﬁnic stocks
are used normally in the manufacture of kerosene for lighting and heating.
For the same reason, aromatic stocks and cracked components are avoided.
Some crude oils, especially the parafﬁnic crude oils, contain kerosene frac-
tions of very high quality, but other crude oils, such as those having an
asphalt base, must be thoroughly reﬁned to remove aromatics and sulfur
compounds before a satisfactory kerosene fraction can be obtained. Crack-
ing the less volatile constituents of petroleum is now a major process for
kerosene production.
In the early days, the poorer-quality kerosene was treated with large
quantities of sulfuric acid to convert it into marketable products. However,
this treatment resulted in high acid and kerosene losses, but the later devel-
opment of the Edeleanu process (Speight, 1999) overcame these problems.
Kerosene is a very stable product, and additives are not required to improve
the quality. Apart from the removal of excessive quantities of aromatics by
the Edeleanu process, kerosene fractions may need only a lye wash or a
Doctor treatment if hydrogen sulﬁde is present to remove mercaptans
(Speight, 1999). When low-sulfur parafﬁnic crude oil is fractionated to yield
the proper boiling range fraction, only a drying operation may be required
before shipment.
Kerosene from naphthenic oil or high-sulfur crude oil requires
hydrotreating, acid treatment and water wash, or extraction with a solvent
and caustic wash and clay brightening to remove undesirable aromatics or158 kerosene

(ASTM D-3227, IP 342), and these are removed by caustic washing or con-
verted to odorless compounds by sweetening processes (Speight, 2000).
After treatment, the kerosene streams are blended to meet speciﬁcations
and the ﬁnished product is ready for marketing.
Chemically, kerosene is a mixture of hydrocarbons, and the constituents"
"include n-dodecane ( n-C12H26), alkyl benzenes, and naphthalene and its
derivatives (ASTM D-1840). The chemical composition depends on its
source and has a high number ( >100,000) of isomers that are possible (Table
7.2).The actual number of compounds in kerosene is much lower, and there
are claims to less than 100 constituents but that, again, is source- and process
dependent.production and properties 159
Figure 7.1. Boiling point and carbon number for various hydrocarbons and petroleum productsKerosene, because of its use as burning oil, must be free of aromatic and
unsaturated hydrocarbons as well as free of the more obnoxious sulfur com-
pounds.The desirable constituents of kerosene are saturated hydrocarbons,
and it is for this reason that kerosene is manufactured as a straight-run frac-
tion, not by a cracking process.
7.3. TEST METHODS
Kerosene is composed chieﬂy of hydrocarbons containing 12 or more
carbon atoms per molecule. Although the kerosene constituents are pre-
dominantly saturated materials, there is evidence for the presence of sub-
stituted tetrahydronaphthalenes. Dicycloparafﬁns also occur in substantial
amounts in kerosene. Other hydrocarbons with both aromatic and
cycloparafﬁn rings in the same molecule, such as substituted indane, also
occur in kerosene. The predominant structure of the dinuclear aromatics
appears to be that in which the aromatic rings are condensed, such as naph-
thalene, whereas the isolated two-ring compounds, such as biphenyl, are
only present in traces, if at all (ASTM D-1840).
Low proportions of aromatic and unsaturated hydrocarbons are desir-
able to maintain the lowest possible level of smoke during burning.
Although some aromatics may occur within the boiling range assigned to
kerosene, excessive amounts can be removed by extraction; that kerosene160 kerosene

presence of unsaturated hydrocarbons.
The essential properties of kerosene are ﬂash point (ASTM D-56,ASTM
D-93, ASTM D-3828, IP 34, IP 170, IP 303), distillation range (ASTM D86,
ASTM D-1160, ASTM D-2887, ASTM D-6352), burning characteristics
(ASTM D-187, IP 10), sulfur content (ASTM D-129,ASTM D-2622,ASTM
D-3120, ASTM D-3246, ASTM D-4294, ASTM D-5453, ASTM D-5623, IP
61, IP 336, IP 373), color (ASTM D-156, ASTM D-1209, ASTM D-1500,
ASTM D-1554, ASTM D-2392, ASTM D-3830, ASTM D-6045), and cloud
point (ASTM D-2500, ASTM D-5772, ASTM D-5771, ASTM D-5773, IP
219). In the case of the ﬂash point (ASTM D-56), the minimum ﬂash tem-
perature is generally placed above the prevailing ambient temperature;
the ﬁre point (ASTM D-92) determines the ﬁre hazard associated with its
handling and use.
7.3.1. Acidity
Acids can be present in kerosene aviation turbine fuels because of acid
treatment during reﬁning. These trace acid quantities are undesirable
because of the possibility of metal corrosion and impairment of the burning
characteristics and other properties of the kerosene. The potential for
metals in kerosene is less than it is for aviations fuels, but several of the
same tests can be applied (Chapter 6).
One test method (ASTM D-1093) is used solely for the qualitative deter-
mination of the acidity of hydrocarbon liquids and their distillation residues.
The results are qualitative. Basicity determination can also be performed
with a small change in the procedure (see below). In the test method, a
sample is shaken with water and the aqueous layer is tested for acidity with
methyl orange indicator (red color). Basicity can be determined with phe-
nolphthalein indicator (pink color) instead of the methyl orange indicator.
Another test method (ASTM D-3242, IP 354) covers the determination
of the acidity in an aviation turbine fuel in the range 0.000–0.100 mg potas-
sium hydroxide/g, but the test is not suitable for determining signiﬁcant acid
contamination. In this test, a sample is dissolved in a solvent mixture
(toluene plus isopropyl alcohol and a small amount of water) and under 
a stream of nitrogen is titrated with standard alcoholic KOH to the 
color change from orange in acid to green in base via added indicator p-
naphtholbenzein solution.
7.3.2. Burning Characteristics
The ability of kerosene to burn steadily and cleanly over an extended
period (ASTM D-187, IP 10) is an important property and gives some indi-test methods 161cation of the purity or composition of the product.The quality of a kerosene
as a burning oil is related to its burning characteristics and is dependent on
such factors as its composition, volatility, viscosity, caloriﬁc value, sulfur
content, and freedom from corrosive substances or contaminants. This 
test method covers the qualitative determination of the burning properties"
"of kerosene to be used for illuminating purposes. In the test, a kerosene
sample is burned for 16 h in a speciﬁed lamp under speciﬁed conditions.
The average rate of burning, the change in the shape of the ﬂame, and the
density and color of the chimney deposit are reported. A corresponding 
test method (IP 10) is used for the quantitative evaluation of the wick 
char-forming tendencies of kerosene.
However, the effect of hydrocarbon type composition is greater with
wick-fed yellow ﬂame burners than with wick-fed blue ﬂame burners. With
the former, kerosenes that are mainly parafﬁnic burn well in lamps with a
poor draft, whereas under the same conditions kerosenes containing high
proportions of aromatics and naphthenes burn with a reddish or even
smoky ﬂame.
The smoke point test (ASTM D-1319, ASTM D-1322, IP 57, IP 156)
enables this property to be measured. In this test the oil is burned in a stan-
dard wick-fed lamp in which ﬂame height can be varied against a back-
ground of a graduated scale. The maximum ﬂame height in millimeters at
which the oil burns without smoking under the standard conditions is
termed the smoke point. Even if full advantage is not taken to utilize
maximum nonsmoking ﬂame height, the property of high smoke point
ensures that in the event of sudden draft causing extension in ﬂame height,
there will be less tendency for smoking to occur in such circumstances. The
smoke point test is also used in the assessment of the burning characteris-
tics of certain aviation turbine fuels.
The 7-day burning test (IP 11) is used to evaluate the burning proper-
ties of oil for which long periods of uninterrupted and unattended burning
may be necessary. The oil is burned for 7 days in a speciﬁed lamp under
strictly controlled conditions. Every 24 h during the test the ﬂame height is
measured, and at the end of the test the condition of the wick and burner
is also recorded. A corresponding test (ASTM D-219) is available in which
a standard semaphore lamp is used. The test is continued until 650 ml of oil
are burned, which usually takes about 5–6 days. At the end of the test, the
change in the height of the ﬂame and the condition of the wick and chimney
are recorded.
The 24-h burning test (ASTM D-187) involves noting the average oil con-
sumption, change in ﬂame dimensions, and ﬁnal appearance of wick and
chimney.No quantitative determination of char value is made (IP-10).In this
method the oil is burned for 24 h in the standard lamp with a ﬂame initially
adjusted to speciﬁed dimensions.The details of operation are carefully spec-162 keroseneiﬁed and involve the test room conditions, volume of sample, wick nature,
pretreatment of wick and glass chimney, method of wick trimming, and pro-
cedure for removal of the char. At the conclusion of the test, the oil con-
sumption and the amount of char formed on the wick are determined and
the char value is calculated as milligrams per kilogram of oil consumed. A
qualitative assessment of the appearance of the glass chimney is also made.
The considerable effect on char-forming tendency of even traces of high-
boiling contaminants is demonstrated by the fact that the addition of 0.01%
of a heavy lubricating oil to a kerosene of a char value of 103mg/kg (the
char value) can result in doubling that char value.
7.3.3. Caloriﬁc Value (Heat of Combustion)
The heat of combustion (ASTM D-240, ASTM D-1405, ASTM D-2382,
ASTM D-2890, ASTM D-3338, ASTM D-4529, ASTM D-4809, ASTM D-
6446, IP 12) is a direct measure of fuel energy content and is determined
as the quantity of heat liberated by the combustion of a unit quantity of
fuel with oxygen in a standard bomb calorimeter. A high caloriﬁc value is
obviously desirable in oil used for heating purposes. Caloriﬁc value does
not, however, vary greatly in the range of parafﬁnic-type kerosene (ASTM
D-240, IP 12).
When an experimental determination of heat of combustion is not avail-
able and cannot be made conveniently, an estimate might be considered sat-
isfactory (ASTM D-6446). In this test method the net heat of combustion
is calculated from the density and sulfur and hydrogen content, but this 
calculation is justiﬁable only when the fuel belongs to a well-deﬁned class
for which a relationship between these quantities has been derived from
accurate experimental measurements on representative samples. Thus the
hydrogen content (ASTM D-1018, ASTM D-1217, ASTM D-1298, ASTM
D-3701, ASTM D-4052, ASTM D-4808, ASTM D-5291 IP 160, IP 365),
density (ASTM D-129, ASTM D-1250, ASTM D-1266, ASTM D-2622,
ASTM D-3120, IP 61, IP 107), and sulfur content (ASTM D-2622, ASTM
D-3120, ASTM D-3246, ASTM D-4294, ASTM D-5453, ASTM D-5623, IP
336, IP 373) of the sample are determined by experimental test methods
and the net heat of combustion is calculated with the values obtained by
these test methods based on reported correlations.
Another equation that can be used to calculate the heat of combustion"
"is based on the speciﬁc gravity of the kerosene:
Q=12,400 – 2,100 d2
where Qis the heat of combustion and dis the speciﬁc gravity. However,
the accuracy of any method used to calculate such a property is not test methods 163guaranteed and can only be used as a guide to or approximation of the
measured value.
An alternative criterion of energy content is the aniline gravity product
(AGP), which is related to caloriﬁc value (ASTM D-1405, IP 193). The
aniline gravity product is the product of the API gravity (ASTM D-287,
ASTM D-1298) and the aniline point of the fuel (ASTM D-611, IP 2). The
aniline point is the lowest temperature at which the fuel is miscible with an
equal volume of aniline and is inversely proportional to the aromatic
content. The relationship between the aniline gravity product and caloriﬁc
value is given in the method. In another method (ASTM D-3338), the heat
of combustion is calculated from the fuel density, the 10%, 50%, and 90%
distillation temperatures, and the aromatic content. However, neither
method is legally acceptable, and other methods (ASTM D-240, ASTM D-
1655, ASTM D-4809) are preferred.
7.3.4. Composition
Because of the estimated (or real) number of isomers in this carbon number
range (Table 7.2), complete speciation of individual hydrocarbons is not
possible for middle distillates. Compositional analysis of middle distillates
is obtained in terms of hydrocarbon group type totals. These groups are
most often deﬁned by a chromatographic separation.
Thus the ﬁrst level of compositional information is group type totals as
deduced by adsorption chromatography form the distribution of saturates,
oleﬁns, and aromatics in materials that boil below 315°C (600°F) (ASTM
D-1319). Adsorption methods (ASTM D-2007) can also be used to deter-
mine hydrocarbon types in kerosene, but, with all adsorption methods,
allowances must be made for the loss of volatile constituents during the
workup procedure. Thus column chromatography would be best done with
a stabilized (volatile constituents removed to a predetermined tempera-
ture) feedstock.
Burning oil kerosene contains three main types of hydrocarbons—
parafﬁnic, naphthenic, and aromatic—with a preponderance of the 
parafﬁnic type. This is in contrast to power kerosene , or tractor vaporizing
oil, which has a comparatively high content of aromatics and naphthenes
favorable for high octane rating. It may also contain slight amounts of sulfur
in the form of a variety of organic compounds.
Compositional analysis of kerosene distillates can also be obtained in
terms of mass spectral Z-series (ASTM D-2425, ASTM D-2789, ASTM D-
3239, ASTM D-6379). Mass spectrometry has been a powerful technique
for hydrocarbon type analysis of middle distillates and can provide more
compositional detail than chromatographic analysis. Hydrocarbon types are
classiﬁed in terms of a Z-series. Z in the empirical formula C nH2 n+Zis a164 kerosenemeasure of the hydrogen deﬁciency of the compound (ASTM D-2425).This
method requires that the sample be separated into saturate and aromatic
fractions before mass spectrometric analysis. This separation is standard-
ized (ASTM D-2549) and is applicable to kerosene.
The percentage of aromatic hydrogen atoms and aromatic carbon atoms
can be determined by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spec-
troscopy (ASTM D-5292), but the results from this test are not equivalent
to mass- or volume-percent aromatics determined by the chromatographic
methods. The chromatographic methods determine the percentage by
weight (or the percentage by volume) of molecules that have one or more
aromatic rings. Any alkyl substituents on the rings contribute to the per-
centage of aromatics determined by chromatographic techniques but the
presence of an aromatic ring (no matter what the length of the alkyl side
chain) dictates that the compound be isolated as an aromatic, thereby
leading to erroneous estimates of the carbon atoms in aromatics systems.
Because the aromatic hydrocarbon content of aviation turbine fuels
affects their combustion characteristics and smoke forming tendencies,
the amounts of aromatics (ASTM D-1319, IP 156) are limited. Aromatictest methods 165
Figure 7.2. Effect of size of the alkyl chain on the boiling point of benzene constituents also increase the luminosity of the combustion ﬂame (ASTM
D-l740), which can adversely affect the life of the combustion chamber.
The aromatics content of kerosene can also be determined by a test
method (ASTM D-5186) in which a small aliquot of the sample is injected
onto a packed silica adsorption column and eluted with supercritical carbon
dioxide as the mobile phase. Mono- and polynuclear aromatics in the
sample are separated from nonaromatics and detected with a ﬂame ioniza-
tion detector. The chromatographic areas corresponding to the mono- and
polynuclear and nonaromatic components are determined, and the mass
percent content of each of these groups is calculated by area normalization."
"The results obtained by this method are at least statistically more precise
than those obtained by other test methods (ASTM D-1319,ASTM D-2425).
In yet another test method for the determination of aniline point and
mixed aniline point (ASTM D-611, IP 2), the proportions of the various
hydrocarbon constituents of kerosene can be determined. This test is most
often used to estimate the aromatic content of kerosene. Aromatic com-
pounds exhibit the lowest aniline points and parafﬁn compounds have the
highest aniline points, with cycloparafﬁns (naphthenes) and oleﬁns having
aniline points between the two extremes. In any homologous series the
aniline point increases with increasing molecular weight.
There are ﬁve submethods in the test (ASTM D-611, IP 2) for the deter-
mination of the aniline point: (1) Method A is used for transparent samples
with an initial boiling point above room temperature and where the aniline
point is below the bubble point and above the solidiﬁcation point of the
aniline-sample mixture; (2) method B, a thin ﬁlm method, is suitable for
samples too dark for testing by method A; (3) methods C and D are used
when there is the potential for sample vaporization at the aniline point; (4)
method D is particularly suitable where only small quantities of sample are
available; and (5) method E uses an automatic apparatus suitable for the
range covered by methods A and B.
Oleﬁns in kerosene also inﬂuence the burning characteristics and can be
determined by the bromine number (ASTM D-1159, ASTM D-2710, IP
130).The bromine number is the number of grams of bromine that will react
with 100 g of the sample under the test conditions. The magnitude of the
bromine number is an indication of the quantity of bromine-reactive con-
stituents and is not an identiﬁcation of constituents. It is used as a measure
of aliphatic unsaturation in petroleum samples and as percentage of oleﬁns
in petroleum distillates boiling up to approximately 315°C (600°F). In this
test, a known weight of the sample dissolved in a speciﬁed solvent main-
tained at 0–5°C (32–41°F) is titrated with standard bromide-bromate solu-
tion. Determination of the end point is method dependent.
Gas chromatography (ASTM D-2427, ASTM D-4420, ASTM D-5443,
ASTM D-5580) remains the most reliable method for the determination of166 kerosenehydrocarbon types, including oleﬁns (ASTM D-6296), in kerosene and
similar-boiling fractions. In particular, methods in which a combination of
gas chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (GC-
FTIR) (ASTM D-5986) and gas chromatography and mass spectrometry
(GC-MS) (ASTM D-5769) are ﬁnding increased use. Indeed, Fourier trans-
form infrared spectroscopy has been used to predict properties such as
density, freezing point, ﬂash point, aromatics content, initial boiling point,
ﬁnal boiling point, and viscosity (Garrigues et al., 1995). The data have a
high degree of repeatability and reproducibility.
The signiﬁcance of the total sulfur content of kerosene varies greatly
with the type of oil and the use to which it is put. Sulfur content is of great
importance when the oil to be burned produces sulfur oxides that contam-
inate the surroundings. Only slight amounts of sulfur compounds remain in
kerosene after reﬁning. Reﬁning treatment includes among its objects the
removal of such undesirable products as hydrogen sulﬁde, mercaptan sulfur,
and free or corrosive sulfur. Hydrogen sulﬁde and mercaptans cause objec-
tionable odors, and both are corrosive. Their presence can be detected by
the Doctor test (ASTM D-484, ASTM D-4952, IP 30). The Doctor test
(which is pertinent for petroleum product speciﬁcations; ASTM D-235)
ensures that the concentration of these compounds is insufﬁcient to cause
such problems in normal use. In this test, the sample is shaken with sodium
plumbite solution, a small quantity of sulfur is added, and the mixture is
shaken again. The presence of mercaptans, hydrogen sulﬁde, or both is indi-
cated by discoloration of the sulfur ﬂoating at the oil-water interface or by
discoloration of either of the phases.
Free, or corrosive, sulfur in an appreciable amount could result in cor-
rosive action on the metallic components of an appliance. Corrosive action
is of particular signiﬁcance in the case of pressure burner vaporizing tubes
that operate at high temperatures. The usual test applied in this connection
is the corrosion (copper strip) test (ASTM D-130, ASTM D-849, IP 154).
The copper strip test methods are used to determine the corrosiveness
to copper of gasoline, diesel fuel, lubricating oil, or other hydrocarbons.
Most sulfur compounds in petroleum are removed during reﬁning.
However, some residual sulfur compounds can have a corroding action on
various metals. This effect is dependent on the types of sulfur compounds
present. The copper strip corrosion test measures the relative degree of 
corrosivity of a petroleum product."
"One method (ASTM D-130, IP 154) uses a polished copper strip
immersed in a given quantity of sample and heated at a temperature and
for a time period characteristic of the material being tested. At the end of
this period the copper strip is removed, washed, and compared with the
copper strip corrosion standards (ASTM, 2001). This is a pass/fail test. In
another method (ASTM D-849), a polished copper strip is immersed in test methods 167200ml of specimen in a ﬂask with a condenser and placed in boiling water for
30 min.At the end of this period, the copper strip is removed and compared
with the ASTM copper strip corrosion standards.This is also a pass/fail test.
It is important that the total sulfur content of burning oil should be low
(ASTM D-1266, IP 107). All the sulfur compounds present in an oil are 
converted to oxides of sulfur during burning. These oxides of sulfur should
not be present to a harmful extent in the immediate atmosphere, and this
applies particularly to indoor burning appliances that are not provided with
a ﬂue. Also, it has been indicated above that a high total sulfur content of
an oil can contribute to the formation of lamp chimney deposits.
Gas chromatography with either sulfur chemiluminescence detection or
atomic emission detection has been used for sulfur-selective detection.
Selective sulfur and nitrogen gas chromatographic detectors, exempliﬁed by
the ﬂame photometric detector (FPD) and the nitrogen-phosphorus detec-
tor (NPD), have been available for many years. However, these detectors
have limited selectivity for the element over carbon, exhibit nonuniform
response, and have other problems that limit their usefulness.
Nitrogen compounds in middle distillates can be selectively detected by
chemiluminescence. Individual nitrogen compounds can be detected down
to 100 ppb nitrogen.
Correlative methods have long been used as a way of dealing with the
complexity of petroleum fractions. Relatively easy to measure physical
properties such as density, viscosity, and refractive index (ASTM D-1218)
have been correlated to hydrocarbon structure (Table 7.3) with the poten-
tial to relate refractive index data to the nature of the constituents of a
petroleum product.
In recent years an entirely new class of correlative methods has been
developed. These use near-infrared (NIR) or mid-infrared spectra together168 kerosene

properties. Properties such as composition (saturates, aromatics), freezing
point, density, viscosity, aromatics, and heat of combustion have been 
successfully predicted.
It is important to recognize that these methods are correlations and
should not be used to estimate properties that are outside the calibration
set.
The color of kerosene is of little signiﬁcance, but a product darker than
usual may have resulted from a change in composition because of contam-
ination or aging and in fact a color darker than speciﬁed (ASTM D-l56)
may be considered by some users as unsatisfactory. Finally, the cloud point
of kerosene (ASTM D-2500) gives an indication of the temperature at
which the wick may become coated with wax particles, thus lowering the
burning qualities of the oil.
Alternatively, the wax appearance point (ASTM D-3117) may also be
determined as a means of estimating the composition of kerosene in terms
of the wax ( n-parafﬁns) content. The wax appearance point is the temper-
ature at which wax crystals begin to precipitate from a fuel. In this test
(ASTM D-3117), a sample is cooled under prescribed conditions with stir-
ring. The temperature at which wax ﬁrst appears is the wax appearance
point.
7.3.5. Density (Speciﬁc Gravity)
Density (speciﬁc gravity) is an important property of petroleum products
and is often part of product speciﬁcations (Table 7.4). Materials are usually
bought and sold on this basis or, if on a volume basis, then converted to a
mass basis via density measurements.This property is almost synonymously
termed as density (mass of liquid per unit volume), speciﬁc gravity (the ratio
of the mass of a given volume of liquid to the mass of an equal volume of
pure water at the same temperature), and relative density (same as speciﬁctest methods 169

Casinghead liquid 0.62–0.70 97–70

Lubricating oil 0.88–0.98 29–13
Residua and cracked residua 0.88–1.06 29–2gravity). Usually a hydrometer, pycnometer, or  digital density meter is used
in these standards (ASTM, 2000)."
"Speciﬁc gravity has no relation to burning quality but is a useful aid in
checking consistency of production of a particular grade. The speciﬁc
gravity of kerosene can be determined very conveniently by the hydrome-
ter method (ASTM D-1298, IP 160).
7.3.6. Flash Point
The ﬂash point is a guide to the ﬁre hazard associated with the use of
kerosene; it can be determined by several test methods, and the results are
not always strictly comparable. Generally, the ﬂash point of kerosene is
speciﬁed as being in excess of 38°C (100°F) because of production as well
as safety considerations.
The minimum ﬂash point is usually deﬁned by the Abel method (IP 170),
except for high-ﬂash kerosene, where the Pensky-Martens method (ASTM
D-93, IP 34) is speciﬁed. The TAG method (ASTM D-56) is used for both
the minimum and maximum limits, whereas certain military speciﬁcations
also give minimum limits by the Pensky-Martens method (ASTM D-93,
IP 34). The Abel method (IP 170) can give results up to 2–3°C (3–5°F) 
lower than the TAG method (ASTM D-56).
7.3.7. Freezing Point
The freezing point of kerosene is not of the same importance as the freez-
ing point of aviation fuel (Chapter 6) but deserves mention because of its
inﬂuence on kerosene use.
Three test methods are available for determination of the freezing point.
All three methods have been found to give equivalent results. However,
when a speciﬁcation calls for a speciﬁc test, only that test must be used.
In the ﬁrst test (ASTM D-2386, IP 16), a measured fuel sample is placed
in a jacketed sample tube also holding a thermometer and a stirrer. The
tube is placed in a vacuum ﬂask containing the cooling medium. Various
coolants used are acetone, methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or isopropyl
alcohol, solid carbon dioxide, or liquid nitrogen. As the sample cools, it is
continuously stirred. The temperature at which the hydrocarbon crystals
appear is recorded. The jacketed sample is removed from the coolant and
allowed to warm, under continuous stirring. The temperature at which the
crystals completely disappear is recorded.
In the second test (ASTM D-5901, IP 434), an automated optical method
is used for the temperature range to –70°C (–94°F). In this method, a 
25-min portion of the fuel is placed in a test chamber that is cooled while
continuously being stirred and monitored by an optical system. The 170 kerosenetemperature of the specimen is measured with an electronic measuring
device, and the temperatures when crystals ﬁrst appear and then, on
warming, disappear are recorded.
In the third method (ASTM D-5972, IP 435), an automated phase tran-
sition method is used in the temperature range –80 to 20°C (–112°F to
68°F). In this test, a specimen is cooled at a rate of 15 ± 5°C/min while con-
tinuously being illuminated by a light source. The specimen is continuously
monitored by an array of optical detectors for the ﬁrst formation of solid
hydrocarbon crystals. After that the specimen is warmed at the rate of 10
± 0.5°C/min until all crystals return to the liquid phase, and that tempera-
ture is also recorded.
7.3.8. Pour Point
The pour point should not be confused with the freezing point . The pour
point is an index of the lowest temperature at which the crude oil will ﬂow
under speciﬁed conditions. The maximum and minimum pour point tem-
peratures provide a temperature window where petroleum, depending on
its thermal history, might appear in the liquid as well as the solid state. Pour
point data can be used to supplement other measurements of cold ﬂow
behavior, and the data are particularly useful for screening of the effect of
wax interaction modiﬁers on the ﬂow behavior of petroleum.
In the original (and still widely used) test for pour point (ASTM D-97,
IP 15), a sample is cooled at a speciﬁed rate and examined at intervals of
3°C (5.4°F) for ﬂow characteristics. The lowest temperature at which the
movement of the oil is observed is recorded as the pour point.
A later test method (ASTM D-5853) covers two procedures for the
determination of the pour point of crude oils down to –36°C. One method
provides a measure of the maximum (upper) pour point temperature. The
second method measures the minimum (lower) pour point temperature. In
these methods, the test specimen is cooled (after preliminary heating) at a
speciﬁed rate and examined at intervals of 3°C (5.4°F) for ﬂow character-
istics. Again, the lowest temperature at which movement of the test speci-
men is observed is recorded as the pour point.
In any determination of the pour point, petroleum that contains wax pro-
duces an irregular ﬂow behavior when the wax begins to separate. Such
petroleum possesses viscosity relationships that are difﬁcult to predict in
pipeline operations. In addition, some waxy petroleum is sensitive to heat
treatment that can also affect the viscosity characteristics. This complex
behavior limits the value of viscosity and pour point tests on waxy petro-"
"leum. However, laboratory pumpability tests (ASTM D-3245, IP 230) are
available that give an estimate of minimum handling temperature and
minimum line or storage temperature.test methods 1717.3.9. Smoke Point
Although a low smoke point is undesirable in that it may not give a satis-
factory range of smokeless performance, a high smoke point alone is no
guarantee that a kerosene has generally satisfactory burning characteristics.
The smoke point test adequately reﬂects the essential feature of hydrocar-
bon type composition in relation to burning characteristics, as already indi-
cated, and consequently no analysis for composition is necessary in the
normal evaluation of burning oils.
Kerosene can vary widely in its burning quality as measured by carbon
deposition, smoke formation, and ﬂame radiation. This is a function of
hydrocarbon composition—parafﬁns have excellent burning properties, in
contrast to those of the aromatics (particularly the polynuclear aromatic
hydrocarbons). As a control measure the smoke point test (ASTM D-l322,
IP 57) gives the maximum smokeless ﬂame height in millimeters at which
the fuel will burn in a wick-fed lamp under prescribed conditions. The com-
bustion performance of wide-cut fuels correlates well with smoke point
when a fuel volatility factor is included, because carbon formation tends to
increase with boiling point. A minimum smoke volatility index (SVI) value
is speciﬁed and is deﬁned as:
SVI =smoke point +0.42 (percent distilled below 204°C/400°F).
However, the smoke point is not always a reliable criterion of combus-
tion performance and should be used in conjunction with other properties.
Various alternative laboratory test methods have previously been speciﬁed
such as the lamp burning test (ASTM D-187, IP 10) and a limit on the
polynuclear aromatic content (ASTM D-1840), as well as the luminometer
number (ASTM D-l740). The test apparatus is a smoke point lamp modi-
ﬁed to include a photoelectric cell for ﬂame radiation measurement and 
a thermocouple to measure temperature rise across the ﬂame. The fuel
luminometer number (LN) is expressed on an arbitrary scale on which
values of 0 to 100 are given to the reference fuels tetralin and iso-octane,
respectively.
7.3.10. Viscosity
The kinematic viscosity of many petroleum fuels is important for their
proper use, for example, ﬂow of fuels through pipelines, injection nozzles,
and oriﬁces, and the determination of the temperature range for proper
operation of the fuel in burners.
The quantity of oil ﬂowing up a wick is related to the height of the top of
the wick above the level of oil in the container and the viscosity and surface172 kerosenetension of the oil. Viscosity (ASTM D-445, IP 71) is more signiﬁcant in this
respect than surface tension, because it varies more in magnitude than the
latter with different kerosenes and with change of temperature.
7.3.11. Volatility
An abnormally high ﬁnal boiling point and percentage residue of a
kerosene may indicate contamination with higher-boiling constituents,
although the presence of trace quantities of very heavy oils sufﬁcient to
cause high char values might not necessarily be revealed by these features.
Thus the boiling range of kerosene is an important aspect of kerosene 
properties.
The boiling range (ASTM D-86, IP 123) is of less importance for
kerosene than for gasoline, but it is an indication of the viscosity of the
product, for which there is no requirement for kerosene. The nature of the
distillation range (ASTM D-86, IP 123) is of signiﬁcance with regard to
burning characteristics. It can control the ﬂash point and viscosity, the effect
of which has already been mentioned. The initial boiling point and the 10%
point chieﬂy affect the ﬂash point and ease of ignition, whereas the mid-
boiling point is more relevant to the viscosity.
Another test method (ASTM D-6352) that can be used for product spec-
iﬁcation testing is applicable to petroleum distillate fractions with an initial
boiling point of <700°C (<1292°F) at atmospheric pressure.This test method
extends the scope of other test methods (ASTM D-D 86, ASTM D-1160,
ASTM D-2887) to boiling range determination by gas chromatography. In
the method, a nonpolar open tubular capillary gas chromatographic column
is used to elute the hydrocarbon components of the sample in order of
increasing boiling point. A sample aliquot diluted with a viscosity-reducing
solvent is introduced into the chromatographic system. The column oven
temperature is raised at a speciﬁed linear rate to effect separation of the
hydrocarbon components. The detector signal is recorded as area slices for
consecutive retention time intervals during the analysis. Retention times of
known normal parafﬁn hydrocarbons spanning the scope of the test method
are used for normalizing the retention times of the unknown mixture area
slices.
Contamination of kerosene with heavy oil may also be revealed by the"
"test method that is used to determine the amount of residue left by evap-
oration (ASTM D-381, IP 131), although this depends on the relative
volatility of the contaminant.
One of the most important physical parameters deﬁning these products
is their boiling range distribution, which can be determined using a low-
efﬁciency, one-theoretical plate distillation procedure (ASTM D-86). This
has been adequate for product speciﬁcation purposes; however, engineer-test methods 173ing studies require true boiling point (TBP) data (ASTM D-2887, ASTM
D-2892).
The vapor pressure of petroleum products at various vapor-to-liquid
ratios is an important physical property for shipping and storage. Although
determining the volatility of kerosene is usually accomplished through a
boiling range distribution (ASTM D-86, IP 123), determination of the Reid
vapor pressure (ASTM D-323, IP 69) can also be used along with several
other methods (ASTM D-5190, ASTM D-5482, ASTM D-6378).
7.3.12. Water and Sediment
Kerosene, because of its higher density and viscosity, tends to retain ﬁne
particulate matter and water droplets in suspension for a much longer time
than gasoline. Free water in kerosene can be detected by the use of a Dean
and Stark adaptor (ASTM D-4006, IP 358) (Fig. 7.3), by the Karl Fischer
titration method (ASTM D-1744, ASTM D-6304), by the distillation
method (ASTM D-95, IP 74), or by a series of alternate tests (ASTM D-
4176, ASTM D-4860). The standard water reaction test method (ASTM D-
1094, IP 289) can also be used.174 kerosene
Figure 7.3. A Dean and Stark adaptor on the bottom of a condenser In addition to water, sediment can also occur and will cause fouling of
the fuel handling facilities and the fuel system. An accumulation of sedi-
ment in storage tanks and on ﬁlter screens can obstruct the ﬂow of kerosene
during use, and a test method is available to determine the water and sed-
iment in fuels (ASTM D-2709). In the test method, a sample of kerosene
is centrifuged at a rcf of 800 for 10 min at 21–32°C in a centrifuge tube read-
able to 0.005ml and measurable to 0.01 ml.After centrifugation, the volume
of water and sediment that has settled into the tip of the centrifuge tube is
read to the nearest 0.005 ml.

DIESEL FUEL
8.1. INTRODUCTION
Kerosene, diesel fuel, and aviation turbine fuel (jet fuel) are members 
of the class of petroleum products known as middle distillates (Gruse and
Stevens, 1960; Guthrie, 1967; Kite and Pegg, 1973; Weissermel and Arpe,
1978; Francis and Peters, 1980; Hoffman, 1983; Austin, 1984; Chenier, 1992;
Hoffman and McKetta, 1993; Hemighaus, 1998; Speight, 1999; Heinrich 
and Duée, 2000). As the name implies, these products are higher boiling
than gasoline but lower boiling than gas oil. Middle distillates cover the"
"boiling range from approximately 175 to 375°C (350–700°F) and the carbon
number range from about C 8to C 24. These products have similar properties
but different speciﬁcations as appropriate for their intended use.
The broad deﬁnition of fuels for land and marine diesel engines and for
nonaviation gas turbines covers many possible combinations of volatility,
ignition quality,viscosity,gravity,stability,and other properties.Various spec-
iﬁcations are used to characterize these fuels (ASTM D-975,ASTM D-2880).
8.2. PRODUCTION AND PROPERTIES
Diesel fuels originally were straight-run products obtained from the distil-
lation of crude oil. Currently, diesel fuel may also contain varying amounts
of selected cracked distillates to increase the volume available. The boiling
range of diesel fuel is approximately 125–328°C (302–575°F) (Table 8.1).
Thus, in terms of carbon number and boiling range, diesel fuel occurs 
predominantly in the kerosene range (Chapter 7), and thus many of the test
methods applied to kerosene can also be applied to diesel fuel. Diesel fuel
depends on the nature of the original crude oil, the reﬁning processes by
which the fuel is produced, and the additive (if any) used, such as the solvent
red dye (ASTM D-6258). Furthermore, the speciﬁcation for diesel fuel 
can exist in various combinations of characteristics such as, for example,
volatility, ignition quality, viscosity, gravity, and stability.
One of the most widely used speciﬁcations (ASTM D-975) covers three
grades of diesel fuel oils, No. l-D, No. 2-D, and No. 4-D. Grades No. l-D and
1772-D are distillate fuels (ASTM D-975), the types most commonly used in
high-speed engines of the mobile type, in medium speed stationary engines,
and in railroad engines. Grade 4-D covers the class of more viscous distil-
lates and, at times, blends of these distillates with residual fuel oils. The
marine fuel speciﬁcations (ASTM D-2069) have four categories of distillate
fuels and ﬁfteen categories of fuels containing residual components.
Additives may be used to improve the fuel performance, and additives
such as alkyl nitrates and nitrites (ASTM D-1839, ASTM D-4046) can
improve ignition quality. Pour point depressants can improve low-
temperature performance. Antismoke additives reduce exhaust smoke,
which is of growing concern as more and more attention is paid to atmos-
pheric pollution. Antioxidant and sludge dispersants may also be used, par-
ticularly with fuels formulated with cracked components, to prevent the
formation of insoluble compounds that could cause line and ﬁlter plugging
(ASTM D-2068, ASTM D-6371, IP 309).
8.3. TEST METHODS
As for all fuels, the properties of a product deﬁne the ability to serve a
stated purpose. Once the required properties are determined, they are con-
trolled by appropriate tests and analyses. The quality criteria and methods
for testing fuels for land and marine diesel engines, such as the cetane number,
apply to both fuels.178 diesel fuel

Petroleum products may contain acidic constituents that are present as
additives or as degradation products, such as oxidation products. The rela-
tive amount of these constituents can be determined by titrating a sample
of the product with base, and the acid number is a measure of the amount
of acidic substances in the product under the conditions of the test.
One of the test methods (ASTM D-664) resolves constituents into
groups having weak-acid and strong-acid ionization properties. In this test
method, the sample is dissolved in a mixture of toluene and isopropyl
alcohol containing a small amount of water and titrated potentiometrically
with alcoholic potassium hydroxide by using a glass indicating electrode and
a calomel reference electrode. The meter readings are plotted manually or
automatically against the respective volumes of titrating solution, and the
end points are taken only at well-deﬁned inﬂections in the resulting curve.
The test method may be used to indicate relative changes that occur in
diesel fuel under oxidizing conditions regardless of the color or other 
properties of the resulting oil. There are three other test methods for the
determination of acid numbers (ASTM D-974, ASTM D-3339, ASTM 
D-4739) that are used to measure the inorganic and total acidity of the fuel"
"and indicate its tendency to corrode metals that it may contact.
8.3.2. Appearance and Odor
The general appearance , or color , of diesel fuel is a useful indicator against
contamination by residual (higher boiling) constituents, water, or ﬁne solid
particles. Therefore, it is necessary to make a visual inspection that clear
fuel is being delivered (ASTM D-4176).
Color, being part of the appearance of diesel fuel, should also be deter-
mined because the color of petroleum products is used for manufacturing
control purposes. In some cases the color may serve as an indication of the
degree of reﬁnement of the material. Several color scales are used for deter-
mination (ASTM D-156, ASTM D-1209, ASTM D-1500, ASTM D-1544, IP
196). Typically the methods require a visual determination of color with
colored glass disks or reference materials.
Similarly, acceptance is important with regard to odor , and it is usually
required that diesel fuel is reasonably free of contaminants, such as mer-
captans, which impart unpleasant odors to the fuel (ASTM D-4952, IP 30).
8.3.3. Ash
Small amounts of unburnable material are found in diesel fuel in the form
of soluble metallic soaps and solids, and these materials are designated astest methods 179ash, although “ash-forming constituents” is a more correct term. In the test
for the quantitative determination of ash-forming constituents (ASTM D-
482, IP 4), a small sample of fuel is burned in a weighed container until all
of the combustible matter has been consumed as indicated by the residue
and container attaining a constant weight. The amount of unburnable
residue is the ash content and is reported as percent by weight of the
sample.
The ash-forming constituents in diesel fuel (ASTM D-2880) are typically
so low that they do not adversely affect gas turbine performance, unless
such corrosive species as sodium, potassium, lead, or vanadium are present.
However, there are recommendations for the storage and handling of these
fuels (ASTM D-4418) to minimize potential contamination.
Vanadium can form low-melting compounds such as vanadium pen-
toxide, which melts at 691°C (1275°F) and causes severe corrosive attack
on all of the high-temperature alloys used for gas-turbine blades and diesel
engine valves. If there is sufﬁcient magnesium in the fuel, it will combine
with the vanadium to form compounds with higher melting points and thus
reduce the corrosion rate to an acceptable level. The resulting ash will form
deposits in the turbine, but the deposits are self-spalling when the turbine
is shut down. The use of a silicon-base additive will further reduce the 
corrosion rate by absorption and dilution of the vanadium compounds.
Sodium and potassium can combine with vanadium to form eutectics,
which melt at temperatures as low as 565°C (1050°F), and with sulfur in the
fuel to yield sulfates with melting points in the operating range of the gas
turbine. These compounds produce severe corrosion for turbines operating
at gas inlet temperatures above 649°C (1200°F).Thus the amount of sodium
plus potassium must be limited. For gas turbines operating below 649°C
(1200°F), the corrosion due to sodium compounds is of lesser importance
and can be further reduced by silicon-base additive.
Calcium is not as harmful and may even serve to inhibit the corrosive
action of vanadium. However, the presence of calcium can lead to deposits
that are not self-spalling when the gas turbine is shut down and not readily
removed by water washing of the turbine. Lead can cause corrosion, and,
in addition, it can spoil the beneﬁcial inhibiting effect of magnesium addi-
tives on vanadium corrosion. Because lead is only found rarely in signiﬁ-
cant quantities in crude oils, its presence in the fuel oil is primarily the result
of contamination during processing or transportation.
8.3.4. Caloriﬁc Value (Heat of Combustion)
The heat of combustion (ASTM D-240, ASTM D-1405, ASTM D-2382,
ASTM D-2890, ASTM D-3338, ASTM D-4529, ASTM D-4809, ASTM D-
4868, ASTM D-6446, IP 12) is a direct measure of fuel energy content and180 diesel fuelis determined as the quantity of heat liberated by the combustion of a unit
quantity of fuel with oxygen in a standard bomb calorimeter. There are two
heats of combustion, or caloriﬁc values, for every petroleum fuel, gross and
net. When hydrocarbons are burned one of the products of combustion is
water vapor, and the difference between the two caloriﬁc values is that the
gross value includes the heat given off by the water vapor in condensing
whereas the net value does not include this heat.
When an experimental determination of heat of combustion is not 
available and cannot be made conveniently, an estimate might be consid-
ered satisfactory (ASTM D-6446). In this test method the net heat of com-
bustion is calculated from the density and sulfur and hydrogen content, but
this calculation is justiﬁable only when the fuel belongs to a well-deﬁned"
"class for which a relationship between these quantities has been derived
from accurate experimental measurements on representative samples.Thus
the hydrogen content (ASTM D-1018, ASTM D-1217, ASTM D-1298,
ASTM D-3701, ASTM D-4052, ASTM D-4808, ASTM D-5291 IP 160, IP
365), density (ASTM D-129,ASTM D-1250,ASTM D-1266,ASTM D-2622,
ASTM D-3120, IP 61, IP 107), and sulfur content (ASTM D-2622, ASTM
D-3120, ASTM D-3246, ASTM D-4294, ASTM D-5453, ASTM D-5623, IP
336, IP 373) of the sample are determined by experimental test methods,
and the net heat of combustion is calculated with the values obtained by
these test methods based on reported correlations.
An alternative criterion of energy content is the aniline gravity product
(AGP), which is related to caloriﬁc value (ASTM D-1405, IP 193). The
aniline gravity product is the product of the API gravity (ASTM D-287,
ASTM D-1298) and the aniline point of the fuel (ASTM D-611, IP 2). The
aniline point is the lowest temperature at which the fuel is miscible with an
equal volume of aniline and is inversely proportional to the aromatic
content. The relationship between the aniline gravity product and caloriﬁc
value is given in the method. In another method (ASTM D-3338), the heat
of combustion is calculated from the fuel density, the 10%, 50%, and 90%
distillation temperatures, and the aromatic content. However, neither
method is legally acceptable, and other methods (ASTM D-240, ASTM D-
1655, ASTM D-4809) are preferred.
8.3.5. Carbon Residue
The carbon residue of a petroleum product serves as an indication of the
propensity of the sample to form carbonaceous deposits (thermal coke)
under the inﬂuence of heat. In the current context, carbon residue test
results are widely quoted in diesel fuel speciﬁcations. However, distillate
diesel fuels that are satisfactory in other respects do not have high Con-
radson carbon residue values, and the test is chieﬂy used on residual fuels.test methods 181Tests for Conradson carbon residue (ASTM D-189, IP 13) (Fig. 8.1), the
Ramsbottom carbon residue (ASTM D-524, IP 14), and the microcarbon
carbon residue (ASTM D-4530, IP 398) are often included in speciﬁcation
data for diesel fuel. The data give an indication of the amount of coke that
will be formed during thermal processes as well as an indication of the
amount of high-boiling constituents in petroleum.
8.3.6. Cetane Number and Cetane Index
The cetane number is an important property of diesel fuel. In the majority
of diesel engines, the ignition delay period is shorter than the duration of
injection. Under such circumstances, the total combustion period can be
considered to be divided into the following four stages: (1) ignition delay,
(2) rapid pressure rise, (3) constant pressure or controlled pressure rise, and
(4) burning on the expansion stroke.
The cetane number of a diesel fuel is the numerical result of an engine
test designed to evaluate fuel ignition delay.To establish the cetane number182 diesel fuel
Figure 8.1. Apparatus for the determination of the Conradson carbon residue (ASTM 
D-189, IP 13)scale, two reference fuels were selected. One, normal cetane, has excellent
ignition qualities and, consequently, a very short ignition delay. A cetane
number of 100 was arbitrarily assigned to this fuel. The second fuel, a-
methylnaphthalene, has poor ignition qualities and was assigned a cetane
number of 0. a-Methylnaphthalene has been replaced as a primary 
reference fuel by heptamethylnonane, which has a cetane number of 15 as
determined by use of the two original primary reference fuels.
To determine the cetane number of any fuel, its ignition delay is 
compared in a standard test engine with a blend of reference fuels (ASTM
D-613, IP 41).
The cetane number of a diesel fuel is deﬁned as the whole number
nearest to the value determined by calculation from the percentage by
volume of normal cetane (cetane No. 100) in a blend with heptamethyl-
nonane (cetane No. =15) which matches the ignition quality of the test
fuel when compared by this method. The matching blend percentages to
the ﬁrst decimal are inserted in the following equation to obtain the cetane
number:
cetane number =% n-cetane +0.15 (% heptamethylnonane)
The shorter the ignition delay period, the higher the cetane number of 
the fuel and the smaller the amount of fuel in the combustion chamber
when the fuel ignites. Consequently, high-cetane-number fuels generally
cause lower rates of pressure rise and lower peak pressures, both of which
tend to lessen combustion noise and to permit improved control of com-
bustion, resulting in increased engine efﬁciency and power output.
In addition to the above, higher-cetane-number fuels tend to result 
in easier starting, particularly in cold weather, and faster warm-up. The
higher-cetane-number fuels also usually form softer and hence more readily
purged combustion chamber deposits and result in reduced exhaust smoke"
"and odor. High-speed diesel engines normally are supplied with fuels in the
range of 45–55 cetane number.
Because the determination of cetane number by engine testing requires
special equipment, as well as being time-consuming and costly, alternative
methods have been developed for calculating estimates of cetane number.
The calculations are based on equations involving values of other known
characteristics of the fuel.
One of the most widely used methods is based on the calculated cetane
index formula. This formula represents a method for estimating the cetane
number of distillate fuels from API gravity and mid-boiling point.The index
value as computed from the formula is designated as a calculated cetane
index (ASTM D-976, IP 218). Because the formula is complicated in its
manipulation, a nomograph based on the equation has been developed for
its solution.test methods 1838.3.7. Cloud Point
Under low-temperature conditions, parafﬁnic constituents of diesel fuel
may be precipitated as a wax. This settles out and blocks the fuel system
lines and ﬁlters, causing malfunctioning or stalling of the engine. The tem-
perature at which the precipitation occurs depends on the origin, type, and
boiling range of the fuel. The more parafﬁnic the fuel, the higher the pre-
cipitation temperature and the less suitable the fuel for low-temperature
operation.
The temperature at which wax is ﬁrst precipitated from solution can be
measured by the cloud point test (ASTM D-2500, ASTM D-5771, ASTM
D-5772, ASTM D-5773, IP 219). The cloud point of a diesel fuel is a guide
to the temperature at which it may clog ﬁlter systems and restrict ﬂow.
Cloud point is becoming increasingly important for fuels used in high-speed
diesel engines, especially because of the tendency to equip such engines
with ﬁner ﬁlters. The ﬁner the ﬁlter, the more readily it will become clogged
by small quantities of precipitated wax. Larger fuel lines and ﬁlters of
greater capacity reduce the effect of deposits from the fuel and therefore
widen the cloud point range of fuels that can be used.
In the simple cloud point test method (ASTM D-2500), the sample is
ﬁrst heated to a temperature above the expected cloud point and then
cooled at a speciﬁed rate and examined periodically. The temperature at
which haziness is ﬁrst observed at the bottom of the test jar is recorded as
the cloud point.
8.3.8. Composition
The chemical composition of diesel fuel is extremely complex, with an enor-
mous number of compounds normally present (Table 8.2). For this reason,
it usually is not practical to analyze diesel fuel for individual compounds
but it is often advantageous to deﬁne the compounds present as broad clas-
siﬁcations of compound types, such as aromatics, parafﬁns, naphthenes and
oleﬁns.
One of the most important physical parameters deﬁning diesel fuel, and
other middle distillate products, is the boiling range distribution (ASTM 
D-86, ASTM D-2887, ASTM D-2892). However, the ﬁrst major level of
compositional information is group-type totals as deduced by adsorption
chromatography (ASTM D-1319) (Fig. 8.2) to give volume percent satu-
rates, oleﬁns, and aromatics in materials that boil below 315°C (600°F).
Following from this separation, the compositional analysis of diesel fuel 
and other middle distillates is then determined by a mass spectral Z series
on which Z in the empirical formula C nH2n+Zis a measure of the hydrogen
deﬁciency of the compound (ASTM D-2425,ASTM D-2786,ASTM D-3239,184 diesel fuelASTM D-6379). Mass spectrometry can provide more compositional detail
than chromatographic analysis. However, this method requires that the
sample be separated into saturate and aromatic fractions (ASTM D-2549)
before mass spectrometric analysis. This separation is applicable to diesel
fuel but not to jet fuel, because it is impossible to evaporate the solvent
used in the separation without also losing the light ends of the jet fuel.
The aromatic hydrocarbon content of diesel fuel affects the cetane
number and exhaust emissions. One test method (ASTM D-5186) is 
applicable to diesel fuel and is unaffected by fuel coloration. Aromatics 
concentration in the range 1–75 mass% and polynuclear aromatic 
hydrocarbons in the range 0.5–50 mass% can be determined by this test
method. In the method, a small aliquot of the fuel sample is injected onto
a packed silica adsorption column and eluted with supercritical carbon
dioxide mobile phase. Mono- and polynuclear aromatics in the sample are
separated from nonaromatics and detected with a ﬂame ionization detec-
tor. The detector response to hydrocarbons is recorded throughout the
analysis time. The chromatographic areas corresponding to the mononu-
clear aromatic constituents, polynuclear aromatic constituents, and nonaro-
matic constituents are determined ,and the mass-percent content of each of
these groups is calculated by area normalization.
Whereas nuclear magnetic resonance can be used to determine mass-"
"percent hydrogen in diesel fuel (ASTM D-3701, ASTM D-4808), the per-
centage of aromatic hydrogen atoms and aromatic carbon atoms can betest methods 185

5292). However, the results from this test are not equivalent to mass- or
volume-percent aromatics determined by the chromatographic methods.
The chromatographic methods determine the mass or volume percentage
of molecules that have one or more aromatic rings. Any alkyl substituents
on the rings contribute to the percentage of aromatics determined by 
chromatographic techniques.
The signiﬁcance of the total sulfur content of diesel fuel cannot be 
overestimated and is of great importance because of the production of
sulfur oxides that contaminate the surroundings. Generally, only slight
amounts of sulfur compounds remain in diesel fuel after reﬁning, and the
diesel fuel must meet sulfur speciﬁcation. However, with the planned reduc-186 diesel fuel
Figure 8.2. Apparatus for adsorption chromatographytion of sulfur in future speciﬁcations, sulfur detection becomes even more
important.
Reﬁning treatment includes among its objects the removal of such unde-
sirable products as hydrogen sulﬁde, mercaptan sulfur, and free or corro-
sive sulfur. Hydrogen sulﬁde and mercaptans cause objectionable odors,
and both are corrosive.The presence of such compounds can be determined
by the Doctor test (ASTM D-484, ASTM D-4952, IP 30). The Doctor test
(which is pertinent for petroleum product speciﬁcations; ASTM D-235)
ensures that the concentration of these compounds is insufﬁcient to cause
such problems in normal use. In the test, the sample is shaken with sodium
plumbite solution, a small quantity of sulfur is added, and the mixture is
shaken again. The presence of mercaptans, hydrogen sulﬁde, or both is 
indicated by discoloration of the sulfur ﬂoating at the oil-water interface or
by discoloration of either of the phases.
Free, or corrosive, sulfur in appreciable amount could result in corrosive
action on the metallic components of an appliance. Corrosive action is of
particular signiﬁcance in the case of pressure burner vaporizing tubes that
operate at high temperatures. The usual test applied in this connection is
the corrosion (copper strip) test (ASTM D-130, ASTM D-849, IP 154).
The copper strip test methods are used to determine the corrosiveness
to copper of diesel fuel and are a measure of the relative degree of corro-
sivity of diesel fuel. Most sulfur compounds in petroleum are removed
during reﬁning. However, some residual sulfur compounds can have a 
corroding action on various metals, and the effect is dependent on the types
of sulfur compounds present. One method (ASTM D-130, IP 154) uses a
polished copper strip immersed in a given quantity of sample and heated
at a temperature for a time period characteristic of the material being
tested. At the end of this period the copper strip is removed, washed, and
compared with the copper strip corrosion standards (ASTM, 2000). This is
a pass/fail test. In another method (ASTM D-849) a polished copper strip
is immersed in 200 ml of specimen in a ﬂask with a condenser and placed
in boiling water for 30 min. At the end of this period, the copper strip is
removed and compared with the ASTM copper strip corrosion standards.
This is also a pass/fail test.
Nitrogen compounds in diesel fuel and middle distillates can be selec-
tively detected by chemiluminescence. Individual nitrogen compounds can
be detected down to 100 ppb nitrogen.
Sulfur can cause wear, resulting from the corrosive nature of its com-
bustion by -products and from an increase in the amount of deposits in the
combustion chamber and on the pistons. The sulfur content of a diesel fuel
(ASTM D-129, ASTM D-1266, ASTM D-l551, ASTM D-1552, ASTM D-
2622, ASTM D-4294, IP 61, IP 63) depends on the origin of the crude oil
from which it is made and on the reﬁning methods. Sulfur can be presenttest methods 187in a number of forms, for example, as mercaptans, sulﬁdes, disulﬁdes, or 
heterocyclic compounds such as thiophenes, all of which will affect wear
and deposits.
Sulfur is measured on the basis of both quantity and potential corrosiv-
ity. The quantitative measurements can be made by means of a combustion
bomb (ASTM D-129, IP 61). The measurement of potential corrosivity can
be determined by means of a copper strip procedure (ASTM D-l3, IP 154).
The quantitative determination is an indication of the corrosive tendencies
of the fuel combustion products, whereas the potential corrosivity indicates
the extent of corrosion to be anticipated from the unburned fuel, particu-
larly in the fuel injection system.
In gas turbine fuel, sulfur compounds (ASTM D-2880; notably hydrogen"
"sulﬁde, elemental sulfur, and polysulﬁdes) can be corrosive (ASTM D-130,
IP 30) in the fuel handling systems and mercaptans can attack any elas-
tomers present. Thus mercaptan sulfur content (ASTM D-235, ASTM D-
3227, IP 30, IP 104 ) is limited to low levels because of objectionable odor,
adverse effects on certain fuel system elastomers, and corrosiveness toward
fuel system metals.
8.3.9. Density (Speciﬁc Gravity)
Density (or speciﬁc gravity) is an indication of the density or weight per
unit volume of the diesel fuel. The principal use of speciﬁc gravity (ASTM
D-l298, IP 160) is to convert weights of oil to volumes or volumes to weights.
Speciﬁc gravity also is required when calculating the volume of petroleum
or a petroleum product at a temperature different from that at which the
original volume was measured. Although speciﬁc gravity by itself is not 
a signiﬁcant measure of quality, it may give useful information when con-
sidered with other tests. For a given volatility range, high speciﬁc gravity is
associated with aromatic or naphthenic hydrocarbons and low speciﬁc
gravity with parafﬁnic hydrocarbons. The heat energy potentially available
from the fuel decreases with an increase in density or speciﬁc gravity.
API gravity (ASTM D-1298, IP 160) is an arbitrary ﬁgure related to the
speciﬁc gravity in accordance with the following formula:
°API =141.5/(speciﬁc gravity @ 60/60°F)/131.5
When a fuel requires centrifuging, density is a critical property and as
the density of the fuel approaches the density of water (API gravity =10°C)
the efﬁciency of centrifuging decreases (ASTM D-2069). When separation
of water from the fuel is not required, density is not a signiﬁcant measure
of fuel quality but it may give useful information when used in conjunction
with other tests.188 diesel fuelFor example, for a given volatility range, high speciﬁc gravity is 
associated with aromatic or naphthenic hydrocarbons and low speciﬁc
gravity with parafﬁnic hydrocarbons. Furthermore, caloriﬁc value (heat of
combustion) decreases with an increase in density or speciﬁc gravity.
However, caloriﬁc value expressed per volume of fuel increases with an
increase in density or speciﬁc gravity.
8.3.10. Diesel Index
The diesel index is derived from the API gravity and aniline point (ASTM
D-611, IP 2), the lowest temperature at which the fuel is completely 
miscible with an equal volume of aniline:
diesel index =aniline point (°F) ¥API gravity/100
The above equation is seldom used because the results can be misleading,
especially when applied to blended fuels.
8.3.11. Flash Point
The ﬂash point of a diesel fuel is the temperature to which the fuel must
be heated to produce an ignitable vapor-air mixture above the liquid fuel
when exposed to an open ﬂame. The ﬂash point test is a guide to the ﬁre
hazard associated with the use of the fuel and can be determined by several
test methods, but the results are not always strictly comparable.
The minimum ﬂash point is usually deﬁned by the Abel method (IP 170),
although the Pensky–Martens method (ASTM D-93, IP 34) may also be
speciﬁed. The TAG method (ASTM D-56) is used for both the minimum
and maximum limits, whereas certain military speciﬁcations also give
minimum limits by the Pensky–Martens method (ASTM D-93, IP 34). The
Abel method (IP 170) can give results up to 2–3°C (3–5°F) lower than the
TAG method (ASTM D-56).
Similarly, for diesel fuel the ﬂash point is a guide to the ﬁre hazard 
associated with the fuel and can be determined by the same test methods
as noted above (ASTM D-56, ASTM D-93, ASTM D-3828, IP 34, IP 170,
IP 303).
It should be noted that the various ﬂash point methods can yield 
different numerical results, and in the case of the two most commonly used
methods (Abel and TAG) it has been found that the former (IP 170) can give
results up to 1–2°C lower than the latter method (ASTM D-56). Setaﬂash
(ASTM D-3828, IP 303) results are generally very close to Abel values.
In practice, ﬂash point is important primarily for fuel handling. A ﬂash
point that is too low will cause fuel to be a ﬁre hazard, subject to ﬂashingtest methods 189and possible continued ignition and explosion. In addition, a low ﬂash point
may indicate contamination by more volatile and explosive fuels, such as
gasoline.
8.3.12. Freezing Point
Three test methods are available for determination of the freezing point.
All three methods have been found to give equivalent results. However,
when a speciﬁcation calls for a speciﬁc test, only that test must be used.
In the ﬁrst test (ASTM D-2386, IP 16), a measured fuel sample is placed
in a jacketed sample tube also holding a thermometer and a stirrer. The
tube is placed in a vacuum ﬂask containing the cooling medium. Various
coolants used are acetone, methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or isopropyl
alcohol, solid carbon dioxide, or liquid nitrogen. As the sample cools, it is
continuously stirred. The temperature at which the hydrocarbon crystals"
"appear is recorded. The jacketed sample is removed from the coolant and
allowed to warm, under continuous stirring. The temperature at which the
crystals completely disappear is recorded.
In the second test (ASTM D-5901, IP 434), an automated optical method
is used for the temperature range  to –70°C (–94°F). In this method, a 
25-min portion of the fuel is placed in a test chamber that is cooled while
continuously being stirred and monitored by an optical system. The tem-
perature of the specimen is measured with an electronic measuring device,
and the temperatures when crystals ﬁrst appear and then, on warming, dis-
appear are recorded.
In the third method (ASTM D-5972, IP 435), an automated phase 
transition method is used in the temperature range –80 to 20°C (–112°F to
68°F). In this test, a specimen is cooled at a rate of 15 ± 5°C/min while con-
tinuously being illuminated by a light source. The specimen is continuously
monitored by an array of optical detectors for the ﬁrst formation of solid
hydrocarbon crystals. After that the specimen is warmed at the rate of 
10 ± 0.5°C/min until all crystals return to the liquid phase, and that tem-
perature is also recorded.
The freezing point should not be confused with the pour point , which is
an index of the lowest temperature at which the crude oil will ﬂow under
speciﬁed conditions.
An analogous property, the cold ﬁlter plugging point is suitable for esti-
mating the lowest temperature at which diesel fuel will give trouble-free
ﬂow in certain fuel systems (ASTM D-6371, IP 309). In this test, either
manual or automated apparatus may be used, which is cooled under speci-
ﬁed conditions and, at intervals of 1°C, sample is drawn into a pipette under
a controlled vacuum through a standardized wire mesh ﬁlter.As the sample
continues to cool, the procedure is repeated for each 1°C below the ﬁrst190 diesel fueltest temperature. The testing is continued until the amount of wax crystals
that have separated out of the solution is sufﬁcient to stop or slow down
the ﬂow so that the time taken to ﬁll the pipette exceeds 60 s or the fuel
fails to return completely to the test jar before the fuel has cooled by a
further 1°C. The indicated temperature at which the last ﬁltration was 
commenced is recorded as the cold ﬁlter plugging point .
Alternatively, low-temperature ﬂow test (ASTM D-4539) results are
indicative of the low-temperature ﬂow performance of fuel in some diesel
vehicles. This test method is especially useful for the evaluation of fuels 
containing ﬂow improver additives. In this test method, the temperature of
a series of test specimens of fuel is lowered at a prescribed cooling rate. At
the commencing temperature and at each 1°C interval thereafter, a sepa-
rate specimen from the series is ﬁltered through a 17-mm screen until a
minimum low-temperature ﬂow test pass temperature is obtained. The
minimum low-temperature ﬂow test pass temperature is the lowest tem-
perature, expressed as a multiple of 1°C, at which a test specimen can be
ﬁltered in 60 s or less.
In another test (ASTM D-2068), which was originally designed for dis-
tillate fuel oil (Chapter 9), the ﬁlter-plugging tendency of diesel fuel can be
determined by passing a sample at a constant ﬂow rate (20 ml/min) through
a glass ﬁber ﬁlter medium. The pressure drop across the ﬁlter is monitored
during the passage of a ﬁxed volume of test fuel. If a prescribed maximum
pressure drop is reached before the total volume of fuel is ﬁltered, the
actual volume of fuel ﬁltered at the time of maximum pressure drop is
recorded. The apparatus is required to be calibrated at intervals.
8.3.13. Neutralization Number
Neutralization number (ASTM D-974, IP 139; IP 182) is a measure of the
inorganic and total acidity of the unused fuel and indicates its tendency to
corrode metals with which it may come into contact.
Corrosivity is also determined by a variety of copper corrosion text
methods (ASTM D-130, ASTM D-849, IP 154).
8.3.14. Pour Point
The pour point (ASTM D-97, IP 15) of a fuel is an indication of the lowest
temperature at which the fuel can be pumped. Pour points often occur
8–10°F below the cloud points, and differences of 15–20°F are not uncom-
mon. Fuels, and in particular those fuels that contain wax, will in some 
circumstances ﬂow below their tested pour point. However, the pour point
does give a useful guide to the lowest temperature to which a fuel can be
cooled without setting.test methods 191The maximum and minimum pour point temperatures provide a tem-
perature window where petroleum, depending on its thermal history, might
appear in the liquid as well as the solid state. Pour point data can be used
to supplement other measurements of cold ﬂow behavior, and the data are
particularly useful for the screening of the effect of wax interaction modi-
ﬁers on the ﬂow behavior of petroleum.
In the original (and still widely used) test for pour point (ASTM D-97,"
"IP 15), a sample is cooled at a speciﬁed rate and examined at intervals of
3°C (5.4°F) for ﬂow characteristics. The lowest temperature at which the
movement of the oil is observed is recorded as the pour point.
A later test method (ASTM D-5853) covers two procedures for the
determination of the pour point of crude oils down to –36°C. One method
provides a measure of the maximum (upper) pour point temperature. The
second method measures the minimum (lower) pour point temperature. In
these methods, the test specimen is cooled (after preliminary heating) at 
a speciﬁed rate and examined at intervals of 3°C (5.4°F) for ﬂow charac-
teristics. Again, the lowest temperature at which movement of the test 
specimen is observed is recorded as the pour point.
In any determination of the pour point, petroleum that contains wax 
produces an irregular ﬂow behavior when the wax begins to separate.
Such petroleum possesses viscosity relationships that are difﬁcult to predict
in pipeline operations. In addition, some waxy petroleum is sensitive to heat
treatment that can also affect the viscosity characteristics. This complex
behavior limits the value of viscosity and pour point tests on waxy petro-
leum. However, laboratory pumpability tests (ASTM D-3245, IP 230) are
available that give an estimate of minimum handling temperature and
minimum line or storage temperature.
Sometimes additives are used to improve the low-temperature ﬂuidity
of diesel fuels. Such additives usually work by modifying the wax crystals
so that they are less likely to form a rigid structure. Thus, although there is
no alteration of the cloud point, the pour point may be lowered dramati-
cally. Unfortunately, the improvement in engine performance as a rule is
less than the improvement in pour point. Consequently, the cloud and pour
point temperatures cannot be used to indicate engine performance with any
accuracy.
8.3.15. Stability
On leaving the reﬁnery, the fuel will inevitably come into contact with
air and water. If the fuel includes unstable components, which may be
the case with fuels containing cracked products, storage in the presence
of air can lead to the formation of gums and sediments. Instability can
cause ﬁlter plugging, combustion chamber deposit formation, and192 diesel fuelgumming or lacquering of injection system components with resultant
sticking and wear.
An accelerated stability test (ASTM D-2274) is often applied to fuels to
measure their stability. A sample of fuel is heated for a ﬁxed period at a
given temperature, sometimes in the presence of a catalyst metal, and the
amount of sediment and gum formed is taken as a measure of the stability.
In addition, the extent of oxidation of diesel fuel is determined by mea-
surement of the hydroperoxide number (ASTM D-6447) and the peroxide
number (ASTM D-3703). Deterioration of diesel fuel results in the forma-
tion of the peroxides as well as other oxygen-containing compounds, and
these numbers are indications of the quantity of oxidizing constituents
present in the sample as determined by measurement of the compounds
that will oxidize potassium iodide.
The determination of hydroperoxide number is signiﬁcant because of the
adverse effect of hydroperoxides on certain elastomers in the fuel systems.
This method (ASTM D-6447) measures the same peroxide species, pri-
marily the hydroperoxides in diesel fuel. This test method does not use the
ozone-depleting substance 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-triﬂuoroethane (ASTM D-
3703) and is applicable to any water-insoluble, organic ﬂuid, particularly
gasoline, kerosene, and diesel fuel. In this method, a quantity of sample is
contacted with aqueous potassium iodide (KI) solution in the presence of
acid. The hydroperoxides present are reduced by potassium iodide, liberat-
ing an equivalent amount of iodine, which is quantiﬁed by voltammetric
analysis.
The determination of peroxide number of diesel fuel is important
because of the adverse effects of peroxides on certain elastomers in the
fuel system. In the test, the sample is dissolved (unlike ASTM D-6447)
in 1,1,2-trichloro-l,2,2-triﬂuoroethane and is contacted within an aqueous
potassium iodide solution. The peroxides present are reduced by the potas-
sium iodide whereupon an equivalent amount of iodine is released 
that is titrated with standard sodium thiosulfate solution and a starch
indicator.
Other tests for storage stability include determination of color forma-
tion and sediment (ASTM D-4625, ASTM D-5304) in which reactivity to
oxygen at high temperatures is determined by the amount of sediment for-
mation as well as any color changes.
8.3.16. Viscosity
Viscosity (ASTM D-445, IP 71) is a measure of the resistance to ﬂow by a
liquid and usually is measured by recording the time required for a given
volume of fuel at a constant temperature to ﬂow through a small oriﬁce"
"of standard dimensions. The viscosity of diesel fuel is important primarilytest methods 193because of its effect on the handling of the fuel by the pump and injector
system.
Fuel viscosity also exerts a strong inﬂuence on the shape of the fuel spray
insofar as a high viscosity can result in poor atomization, large droplets, and
high spray jet penetration. The jet tends to be almost a solid stream instead
of forming a spray pattern of small droplets. As a result, the fuel is not dis-
tributed in, or mixed with, the air required for burning. Poor combustion 
is a result, accompanied by loss of power and economy. Moreover, and 
particularly in the smaller engines, the overly penetrating fuel stream can
impinge upon the cylinder walls, thereby washing away the lubricating oil
ﬁlm and causing dilution of the crankcase oil. Such a condition contributes
to excessive wear. On the other hand, fuels with a low viscosity can produce
a spray that is too soft and thus does not penetrate sufﬁciently. Combustion
is impaired, and power output and economy are decreased.
Fuel viscosities for high-speed engines range from 32 SUS to 45 SUS (2
cSt to 6 cSt) at 37.8°C (100°F). Usually the lower viscosity limit is estab-
lished to prevent leakage in worn fuel injection equipment as well as to
supply lubrication for injection system components in certain types of
engines. During operation at low atmospheric temperature, the viscosity
limit sometimes is reduced to 30 SUS (4 cSt) at 100°F to obtain increased
volatility and sufﬁciently low pour point. Fuels having viscosities greater
than 45 SUS (6 cSt) usually are limited in application to the slower-speed
engines. The very viscous fuels, such as are often used in large stationary
and marine engines, usually require preheating for proper pumping, injec-
tion, and atomization.
8.3.17. Volatility
Distillation (or volatility) characteristics of a diesel fuel exert a great inﬂu-
ence on its performance, particularly in medium- and high-speed engines.
Distillation characteristics are measured with a procedure (ASTM D-86, IP
123) in which a sample of the fuel is distilled and the vapor temperatures
are recorded for the percentages of evaporation or distillation throughout
the range. Other procedures are also available that are applicable to
kerosene (Chapter 7).
The volatility requirement of diesel fuel varies with engine speed, size
and design. However, fuels having too low volatility tend to reduce power
output and fuel economy through poor atomization, and those having too
high volatility may reduce power output and fuel economy through vapor
lock in the fuel system or inadequate droplet penetration from the nozzle.
In general, the distillation range should be as low as possible without
adversely affecting the ﬂash point, burning quality, heat content, or viscos-
ity of the fuel. If the 10% point is too high, poor starting may result. An194 diesel fuelexcessive boiling range from 10% to 50% evaporated may increase warm-
up time. A low 50% point is desirable in preventing smoke and odor. Low
90% and end points tend to ensure low carbon residuals and minimum
crankcase dilution.
The temperature for 50% evaporated, known as the mid-boiling point,
usually is taken as an overall indication of the fuel distillation characteris-
tics where a single numerical value is used alone. For example, in high-speed
engines, a 50% point above 575°F (302°C) probably would cause smoke
formation, give rise to objectionable odor, cause lubricating oil contamina-
tion, and promote engine deposits. At the other extreme, a fuel with exces-
sively low 50% point would have too low a viscosity and too low a heat
content per unit volume. Thus a 50% point in the range of 450–535 F
(232–280°C) is most desirable for the majority of automotive-type diesel
engines.This average range usually is raised to a higher temperature spread
for larger, slower-speed engines.
The vapor pressure of diesel fuel at various vapor-to-liquid ratios is an
important physical property for shipping, storage, and use. Although deter-
mining the volatility of diesel fuel is usually accomplished through a boiling
range distribution (ASTM D-86, IP 123), determination of the Reid vapor
pressure (ASTM D-323, IP 69) can also be used along with several other
methods (ASTM D-5190, ASTM D-5482, ASTM D-6378).
8.3.18. Water and Sediment
Water can contribute to ﬁlter blocking and cause corrosion of the injection
system components. In addition to clogging of the ﬁlters, sediment can cause
wear and create deposits both in the injection system and in the engine
itself. Thus one of the most important characteristics of a diesel fuel, the
water and sediment content (ASTM D-1796, IP 75), is the result of han-
dling and storage practices from the time the fuel leaves the reﬁnery until
the time it is delivered to the engine injection system.
Instability and resultant degradation of the fuel in contact with air con-"
"tribute to the formation of organic sediment, particularly during storage
and handling at elevated temperatures. Sediment generally consists of 
carbonaceous material, metals, or other inorganic matter. There are several
causes of this type of contamination: (1) rust or dirt present in tanks and
lines, (2) dirt introduced through careless handling practices, and (3) dirt
present in the air breathed into the storage facilities with ﬂuctuating 
atmospheric temperature.
Sediment can be determined individually (ASTM D-2276, ASTM D-
6217) or by a test method that determines water simultaneously (ASTM D-
2709. In the test method, a sample is centrifuged at a rcf of 800 for 10min
at 21–32°C in a centrifuge tube readable to 0.005 ml and measurable to test methods 1950.01 ml. After centrifugation, the volume of water and sediment that has
settled into the tip of the centrifuge tube is read to the nearest 0.005 ml.

DISTILLATE FUEL OIL
9.1. INTRODUCTION
Most petroleum products can be used as fuels, but the term fuel oil , if used
without qualiﬁcation, may be interpreted differently depending on the
context. However, because fuel oils are complex mixtures of hydrocarbons,
they cannot be rigidly classiﬁed or deﬁned precisely by chemical formu-
lae or deﬁnite physical properties. The arbitrary division or classiﬁcation
of fuel oils is based more on their application than on their chemical or
physical properties. However, two broad classiﬁcations are generally 
recognized: (1) distillate fuel oil and (2) residual fuel oil (Gruse and 
Stevens, 1960; Guthrie, 1967; Kite and Pegg, 1973; Weissermel and Arpe,
1978; Francis and Peters, 1980; Hoffman, 1983; Austin, 1984; Chenier, 1992;
Hoffman and McKetta, 1993; Hemighaus, 1998; Warne, 1998; Speight, 1999;
Charlot, and Claus, 2000; Heinrich and Duée, 2000). This terminology is
used in the present work.
The conventional description of “fuel oil” is generally associated with the
black, viscous residual material remaining as the result of reﬁnery distilla-
tion of crude oil either alone or as a blend with light components, which is
used for steam generation and various industrial processes. The term is
sometimes used to refer to the light, amber-colored middle distillates or gas
oils that are distinguished from the residual fuel oil by being characterized
as distillate fuel oil (ASTM D-396). In this speciﬁcation the No. 1 grade fuel
oil is a kerosene type used in vaporizing pot-type burners whereas the No.
2 fuel is a distillate oil (gas oil) used for general-purpose domestic heating.
Kerosene may also be included in this deﬁnition, but it is described 
elsewhere in this text.
Distillate fuel oils are vaporized and condensed during a distillation
process and thus have a deﬁnite boiling range and do not contain high-
boiling oils or asphaltic components.The generally correspond to a light gas
oil (Table 9.1, Fig. 9.1), but this correlation is not exact and can vary con-
siderably. A fuel oil that contains any amount of the residue from crude"
"distillation of thermal cracking is a residual fuel oil. The terms distillate fuel
oil. and residual fuel oil are losing their signiﬁcance, because fuel oils are
now made for speciﬁc uses and may be either distillates or residuals or 
197mixtures of the two. The terms domestic fuel oil ,diesel fuel oil , and heavy
fuel oil are more indicative of the uses of fuel oils.
Domestic fuel oil is fuel oil that is used primarily in the home. This 
category of fuel oil includes kerosene, stove oil, and furnace fuel oil; these
are distillate fuel oils. Diesel fuel oil is also a distillate fuel oil, but residual
oil has been successfully used to power marine diesel engines, and mixtures
of distillate fuel oil and residual fuel oil have been used in locomotive diesel
engines. Heavy fuel oils include a variety of oils ranging from distillates to
residual oils that must be heated to 260°C (500°F) or more before they can
be used. In general, heavy fuel oils consist of residual oils blended with 
distillates to suit speciﬁc needs. Included among heavy fuel oils are various
industrial oils; when used to fuel ships, heavy fuel oils are called bunker oils.
Because the boiling ranges, sulfur contents, and other properties of even
the same fraction vary from crude oil to crude oil and with the way the
crude oil is processed, it is difﬁcult to specify which fractions are blended
to produce speciﬁc fuel oils. In general, however, furnace fuel oil is a blend
of straight-run gas oil and cracked gas oil to produce a product boiling in
the 175–345°C (350–650°F) range.
Heavy fuel oils usually contain cracked residua, reduced crude, or crack-
ing coil heavy product that is mixed (cut back) to a speciﬁed viscosity with
cracked gas oils and fractionator bottoms. For some industrial purposes 
in which ﬂames or ﬂue gases contact the product (ceramics, glass, heat 
treating, and open-hearth furnaces) fuel oils must be blended to contain198 distillate fuel oil

9.2. PRODUCTION AND PROPERTIES
Distillate fuel oils are petroleum fractions that have been vaporized and
condensed. They are produced in the reﬁnery by a distillation process in
which petroleum is separated into its fractions according to their boiling
range. Distillate fuel oils may be produced not only directly from crude oil
(straight run ) but also from subsequent reﬁnery processes such as thermalproduction and properties 199
Figure 9.1. Boiling point and carbon number for various hydrocarbons and petroleum products or catalytic cracking. Domestic heating oils and kerosene are examples of
distillate fuel oils.
The manufacture of fuel oils at one time largely involved using what was
left after removing desired products from crude petroleum. Now fuel oil
manufacture is a complex matter of selecting and blending various petro-
leum fractions to meet deﬁnite speciﬁcations, and the production of a homo-
geneous, stable fuel oil requires experience backed by laboratory control.
The term domestic heating oil in the present context is applicable to the
middle distillate or gas oil-type product used principally with atomizing
burner-heating equipment. This material may consist of the straight-run gas
oil from the distillation of the crude oil, which boils within the approximate
temperature range of l60–370°C (320–700°F). Straight-run gas oil fraction
is usually blended with the appropriate boiling-range material from 
catalytic cracking processing. The components are suitably treated before
ﬁnal blending, and additives may also be added to further assist in the 
stabilization of the ﬁnished product.
The quality and performance requirements for fuel oils differ widely,
although general quality limitations for various fuel grades are used to serve
as guides in the manufacture, sale, and purchase of the oils. These quality
deﬁnitions are often referred to as speciﬁcations or classiﬁcations , but more
precise speciﬁcations of quality requirements such as the vapor pressure
(ASTM D-323) and metals content (ASTM D-5184, ASTM D-2788, ASTM
D-4951, ASTM D-5185, ASTM D-5708, ASTM D-5863, IP 377) may be
required for any given application (ASTM D-396).
9.3. TEST METHODS
Fuel oil, therefore, in its various categories has an extensive range of appli-"
"cations, and the choice of a standard procedure to be used for assessing or
controlling product quality must, of necessity, depend on both the type of
fuel and its ultimate use. But ﬁrst, as for all petroleum analysis and testing,
the importance of correct sampling of the fuel oil cannot be overempha-
sized, because no proper assessment of quality can be made unless the data
are obtained on truly representative samples (ASTM D-270, IP 51).
9.3.1. Acidity
The presence of inorganic acids in distillate fuels, resulting from reﬁnery
treatment, is unlikely. However, some speciﬁcations for these fuels still
include limiting clauses for total acidity and inorganic acidity as a check
against possible corrosion of metal equipment in contact with the fuel.
Inorganic acidity should in any case be entirely absent.200 distillate fuel oilAcidity is determined through the acid number , which is the quantity of
base, expressed in milligrams of potassium hydroxide per gram of sample,
required to titrate a sample in the solvent from its initial meter reading 
to a meter reading corresponding to a freshly prepared nonaqueous basic
buffer solution or a well-deﬁned inﬂection point as speciﬁed in the test
method. Test methods include potentiometric titration (ASTM D-66, IP
177) and indicator-indicator titration (ASTM D-974, IP 139) in addition to
inorganic acidity (IP 182) and total acidity (IP 1) methods.
One test method (ASTM D-974) resolves constituents into groups
having weak acid and strong acid ionization properties. However, oils such
as fuel oil that are dark-colored oils, which cannot be analyzed by this test
method because of obscurity of the color-indicator end point, should be
analyzed by another test method (ASTM D-664, IP 177) This test method
is used to determine the presence of those constituents that have weak acid
properties and those constituents that have strong acid properties. It may
be used to indicate relative changes that occur in an oil during use under
oxidizing conditions regardless of the color or other properties of the result-
ing oil. In the practice of this method, the sample is dissolved in a mixture
of toluene and isopropyl alcohol containing a small amount of water and
titrated potentiometrically with alcoholic potassium hydroxide by using a
glass indicating electrode and a calomel reference electrode and the end
points are taken at well-deﬁned inﬂections in the resulting curve.
9.3.2. Ash Content
Ash is the organic matter-free (or carbonaceous matter free) residue 
that remains after combustion of a fuel oil at a speciﬁed high temperature
(ASTM D-482, IP 4).
Depending on the use of the fuel, ash composition has a considerable
bearing on whether or not detrimental effects will occur. However, distillate
fuels tend to contain only negligible amounts of ash but pick up ash-forming
constituents during transportation from the reﬁnery. Water transportation,
in particular, presents many opportunities for fuel oils to be contaminated
with ash-forming contaminants (seawater, dirt, and scale rust).
Small amounts of unburnable material are found in fuel oil in the form
of soluble metallic soaps and solids, and these materials are designated as
ash, although “ash-forming constituents” is a more correct term. In the test
for the quantitative determination of ash-forming constituents (ASTM D-
482, IP 4), a small sample of fuel oil is burned in a weighed container until
all of the combustible matter has been consumed, as indicated by the
residue and container attaining a constant weight. The amount of unburn-
able residue is the ash yield, and it is reported as percent by weight of the
sample.test methods 201The ash-forming constituents in distillate fuel (ASTM D 2880) are 
typically so low that they do not adversely affect gas turbine performance,
unless such corrosive species as sodium, potassium, lead, or vanadium are
present. However, there are recommendations for the storage and handling
of these fuels (ASTM D-4418) to minimize potential contamination.
9.3.3. Caloriﬁc Value (Heat of Combustion)
Because the function of a fuel is to produce heat, the caloriﬁc or heating
value (ASTM D-240, IP 12) is one of the important fuel properties and 
a knowledge of this value is necessary in obtaining information regarding
the combustion efﬁciency and performance of all types of oil-burning
equipment.
The determination is made in a bomb calorimeter under speciﬁed con-
ditions, the oxygen in the bomb being saturated with water vapor before
the ignition of the fuel so that the water formed during combustion is 
condensed. The caloriﬁc value so determined will include the latent heat of
water at the test temperature and is known as the gross caloriﬁc value at
constant volume. The corresponding net caloriﬁc value at constant pressure
is obtained by deducting the latent heat of water formed during the burning
of the hydrogen present in the fuel to produce water. The caloriﬁc value is"
"usually expressed in British thermal units per pound (Btu/lb) or in calories
per gram (c/g). In Europe the net caloriﬁc value is more often called for in
calculations on burner efﬁciency because the water formed during com-
bustion passes out as water vapor with the ﬂue gases and hence its latent
heat of condensation is not realized as useful heat. In the U.K. the gross
caloriﬁc value is normally used for this purpose.
An alternative criterion of energy content is the aniline gravity product
(AGP), which is related to caloriﬁc value (ASTM D-1405, IP 193). The
aniline gravity product is the product of the API gravity (ASTM D-287,
ASTM D-1298) and the aniline point of the fuel (ASTM D-611, IP 2). The
aniline point is the lowest temperature at which the fuel is miscible with an
equal volume of aniline and is inversely proportional to the aromatic
content. The relationship between the aniline gravity product and the
caloriﬁc value is given in the method. In another method (ASTM D-3338),
the heat of combustion is calculated from the fuel density, the 10%, 50%,
and 90% distillation temperatures, and the aromatic content. However,
neither method is legally acceptable, and other methods (ASTM D-240,
ASTM D-1655, ASTM D-4809) are preferred.
The aniline gravity product  is not always suitable for determining the
heat of combustion because of the difﬁculties that can be encountered 
in determining the aniline point of the fuel (ASTM D-611, IP 2). It is 202 distillate fuel oilpossible to overcome the issue of color by use of a modiﬁcation of the test
procedure (method B, ASTM D-611, IP 2).
An alternate method of calculation of the caloriﬁc value, when an 
experimental determination is not available or cannot be made conve-
niently, involves an estimate of this property (ASTM D-6446). In this test
method, the net heat of combustion is calculated from the density and sulfur
and hydrogen content, but this calculation is justiﬁable only when the fuel
belongs to a well-deﬁned class for which a relationship between these quan-
tities has been derived from accurate experimental measurements on 
representative samples. Thus the hydrogen content (ASTM D-1018, ASTM
D-1217, ASTM D-1298, ASTM D-3701, ASTM D-4052, ASTM D-4808,
ASTM D-5291, IP 160, IP 365), density (ASTM D-129, ASTM D-1250,
ASTM D-1266, ASTM D-2622, ASTM D-3120, IP 61, IP 107), and sulfur
content (ASTM D-2622, ASTM D-3120, ASTM D-3246, ASTM D-4294,
ASTM D-5453,ASTM D-5623, IP 336, IP 373) of the sample are determined
by experimental test methods, and the net heat of combustion is calculated
with the values obtained by these test methods based on reported 
correlations.
9.3.4. Carbon Residue
The carbon residue of a petroleum product gives an indication of the
propensity for that product to form a carbonaceous residue under thermal
conditions. The carbonaceous residue is correctly referred to as the carbon
residue but is also often referred to as coke or thermal coke .
The use of fuel oil (ASTM No. 2) for heating has resulted in the 
availability of different types of burners that are classiﬁed according to the
manner in which the fuel oil is combusted. Any carbonaceous residue
formed during the thermal decomposition of the fuel oil that is deposited
in, or near, the inlet surface, reduces the fuel oil ﬂow, with resultant loss in
burner efﬁciency. Therefore, fuel oil should have low carbon-forming
propensities. Other petroleum products that are lower boiling than 
distillate fuel oil do not usually reference the carbon residue in the 
speciﬁcations.
Thus assessing the carbon forming tendencies of the fuel oil is carried
out with a carbon residue test. The test methods are (1) the Conradson
carbon residue (ASTM D-189, IP 13), the Ramsbottom carbon residue
(ASTM D-524, IP 14), and the microcarbon carbon residue (ASTM D-4530,
IP 398). The data give an indication of the amount of coke that will be
formed during thermal processes as well as an indication of the amount of
high-boiling constituents in petroleum. For lower-boiling fuel oil, forming
low yields of carbonaceous deposits, the carbon residue value is determinedtest methods 203on a residue (10% by weight of the fuel oil) obtained by means of an adap-
tation of the standard distillation procedure for gas oil (ASTM D-8, IP 123),
so that the accuracy of the determination may be improved.
9.3.5. Cloud Point
Distillate fuel oil for heating installations is usually stored in outside
tankage, and a knowledge of the lowest temperature at which the fuel can
be transferred from tank to burner while avoiding line and ﬁlter blockage
difﬁculties is necessary.
An indication of this temperature may be obtained from the cloud point
(ASTM D-2500,ASTM D-5771,ASTM D-5772,ASTM D-5773, IP 219) and
pour point (ASTM D-97, IP 15). These test methods give, respectively, the
temperature at which wax begins to crystallize out of the fuel and the tem-
perature at which the wax structure has built up sufﬁciently to prevent the"
"ﬂow of oil. In these installations, a coarse ﬁlter is normally sited in the
system near the tank outlet to remove large particles of extraneous matter;
a ﬁne ﬁlter is positioned near the burner to protect the pump.
As the temperature continues to decrease below the cloud point, the for-
mation of wax crystals is accelerated.These crystals clog fuel ﬁlters and lines
and thus reduce the supply of fuel to the burner. Because the cloud point
is a higher temperature than the pour point (4 to 5°C/7 to 9°F, and even
higher), the cloud point is often considered to be more important than the
pour point in establishing distillate fuel oil speciﬁcations for cold weather
usage. The temperature differential between cloud and pour point depends
on the nature of the fuel components, but the use of wax crystal modiﬁers
or pour depressants tends to accentuate these differences.
9.3.6. Composition
The chemical composition of fuel oil is extremely complex, and an
extremely high number of compounds can be present through the hydro-
carbon types, the range of isomeric hydrocarbons (Table 9.2), and the
various types and isomers of heteroatom constituents. Therefore, it is not
practical to perform individual compound analyses but it is often helpful to
deﬁne the compounds present under broad classiﬁcations, such as aromat-
ics, parafﬁns, naphthenes, and oleﬁns.
Thus the ﬁrst level of compositional information is group type totals as
deduced by adsorption chromatography (ASTM D-1319, ASTM D-2007)
or by emulsion chromatography (ASTM D-2549) to give volume percent
saturates, oleﬁns, and aromatics in materials that boil below 315°C (600°F).
In addition, and depending on the characteristics of the fuel oil, gas chro-
matography can also be used for the quantitative determination of oleﬁns204 distillate fuel oil(ASTM D-6296). Following from the chromatographic separation, compo-
sitional analysis of the fractions by a mass spectral Z series in which Z in
the empirical formula C nH2n+Zis a measure of the hydrogen deﬁciency of
the compound is also warranted (ASTM D-2425, ASTM D-2786, ASTM D-
3239, ASTM D-6379).
One mass spectrometric method (ASTM D-2425) requires that the
sample be separated into saturate and aromatic fractions before mass spec-
trometric analysis. This separation is standardized (ASTM D-2549). This
separation is applicable to fuel only when it is possible to evaporate the
solvent used in the separation without also losing the light ends of the jet
fuel. Combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry has been used to
give similar group type results to ASTM D-2425 but without preseparation
into saturates and aromatics. In addition, this method can give the Z series
information by carbon number, showing how the composition changes with
boiling point.
The percentage of aromatic hydrogen atoms and aromatic carbon atoms
can be determined (ASTM D-5292). Results from this test are not equiva-
lent to mass- or volume-percent aromatics determined by the chromato-
graphic methods. The chromatographic methods determine the mass- or
volume-percentage of molecules that have one or more aromatic rings.Any
alkyl substituents on the rings contribute to the percentage of aromatics
determined by chromatographic techniques. ASTM D-292 gives the mole
percent of aromatic hydrogen or carbon atoms.test methods 205

40 62,491,178,805,831Correlative methods have long been used as a way of dealing with 
the complexity of petroleum fractions. Such methods include the use of 
viscosity-temperature charts (ASTM D-341), calculation of the viscosity
index (ASTM D-2270), calculation of the viscosity gravity constant (ASTM
D-2501), calculation of the true vapor pressure (ASTM D-2889), and 
estimation of the heat of combustion (ASTM D-3338).
Organic sulfur compounds (e.g., mercaptans, sulﬁdes, polysulﬁdes,
thiophenes) are present in petroleum products to a greater or lesser extent
depending on the crude oil origin and the reﬁnery treatment. The sulfur
content of fuel oil (ASTM D-396) can be determined by a variety of
methods (ASTM D-129, ASTM D-1552, ASTM D-2622, ASTM D-4294, IP
61, IP 63), with mercaptan sulfur in cracked stocks being particularly 
necessary for evaluation (ASTM D-3227, IP 342).
Corrosion of heating equipment can occur if the sulfur oxides formed on
combustion of fuel oil are allowed to condense in the presence of moisture
on the cooler parts of the ﬂue system. Corrosion of metal parts of the fuel
system may also reﬂect the presence of corrosive sulfur components in the
fuel. The corrosive tendencies of the fuel may be detected by the copper
strip test (ASTM D-l30, ASTM D-849, IP 154), the effect of these sulfur
compounds being indicated by discoloration of the copper strip.
Various standard procedures are available for the determination of the"
"sulfur content of distillate fuels. In the lamp method (ASTM D-l26, IP 107),
which is widely used, the product is burned completely in a small wick-fed
lamp, the gases formed by combustion are absorbed in hydrogen peroxide
solution, and the sulfur is subsequently determined as sulfate. Several rapid
methods, including X-ray absorption and high-temperature combustion, for
the determination of sulfur are also available.
In addition, excessive levels of hydrogen sulﬁde in the vapor phase above
fuel oils in storage tanks may result in corrosion as well as being a health
hazard. One method (ASTM D-5705) is available for the determination of
hydrogen sulﬁde but has been criticized because the test conditions do not
simulate the vapor phase of a fuel storage tank. A second method (ASTM
D-6021) that is believed to be a more accurate simulation of the conditions
in a fuel oil storage tank is available. In this method, a sample of the fuel
oil is placed in a headspace vial and heated in an oven at 60°C (140°F) for
more than 5min but less than 15min. The headspace gas is sampled and
injected into an apparatus capable of measuring hydrogen sulﬁde in the
gaseous sample either by the lead acetate method (ASTM D-4084, ASTM
D-4323) or by the chemiluminescence method (ASTM D-5504).
Nitrogen can be determined by elemental analysis (ASTM D-3228,
ASTM D-5291, ASTM D-5762). Nitrogen compounds in middle distillates
can be selectively detected by chemiluminescence (ASTM D-4629). Indi-
vidual nitrogen compounds can be detected down to 100 ppb nitrogen.206 distillate fuel oil9.3.7. Density (Speciﬁc Gravity)
The density (speciﬁc gravity) of fuel oil is an index of the weight of a 
measured volume of the product (ASTM D-287, ASTM D- D 1250, ASTM
D-1298, ASTM D-1480, ASTM D-1481, ASTM D-4052, IP 160, IP 192, IP
200, IP 365).
The density is the mass (weight in vacuo ) of a unit volume of fuel oil at
any given temperature (ASTM D-1298, IP 160). On the other hand, the 
speciﬁc gravity of a fuel oil is the ratio of the weight of a given volume of
the material at a temperature of 15.6°C (60°F) to the weight of an equal
volume of distilled water at the same temperature, both weights being 
corrected for the buoyancy of air.
The API gravity (ASTM D-1298, IP 160) is an arbitrary ﬁgure related to
the speciﬁc gravity:
°API =141.5/(speciﬁc gravity @ 60/60°F)/131.5
9.3.8. Flash Point
The ﬂash point is a measure of the temperature to which fuel oil must be
heated to produce an ignitable vapor-air mixture above the liquid fuel when
exposed to an open ﬂame. Following from this, the ﬁre point of a fuel is the
temperature at which an oil in an open container gives off vapor at a 
sufﬁcient rate to continue to burn after a ﬂame is applied.
Thus the ﬂash point is used primarily as an index of ﬁre hazards. Con-
sequently, most industry speciﬁcations or classiﬁcations place limits on the
ﬂash point to ensure compliance with ﬁre regulations, insurance, and legal
requirements because it is essential that the fuel is safe to transport and
store. Generally, because of its distillation characteristics, fuel oil should not
contain any volatile or ﬂashable constituents. Nevertheless, the occasion
might arise when application of test methods to determine the ﬂash point
might be applicable.
The test method for determination of the ﬂash point by Pensky–Martens
closed tester (ASTM D-93, IP 34) and the test method for determining ﬂash
point by the tag closed tester (ASTM D-56) are employed for fuel oil.
9.3.9. Metallic Constituents
Metals in fuel oil can seriously affect the use and outcome of fuel oil
systems. Even trace amounts of metals can be deleterious to fuel oil use.
Hence, it is important to have test methods that can determine metals, both
at trace levels and at major concentrations. Metallic constituents in fuel 
oil can be determined by several methods including atomic absorption test methods 207spectrophotometry (ASTM D-2788, ASTM D-5863, ASTM D-5863, IP 285,
IP 288, IP 465), X-ray ﬂuorescence spectrometry (ASTM D-4927, IP 407),
wavelength-dispersive X-ray ﬂuorescence spectrometry (ASTM D-6443, IP
433), and inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICPAES)
(ASTM D-5708).
Inductively coupled argon plasma emission spectrophotometry (ASTM
D-5708) has an advantage over atomic absorption spectrophotometry
(ASTM D-4628, ASTM D-5863) because it can provide more complete 
elemental composition data than the atomic absorption method. Flame
emission spectroscopy is often used successfully in conjunction with atomic
absorption spectrophotometry (ASTM D-3605). X-ray ﬂuorescence spec-
trophotometry (ASTM D-4927, ASTM D-6443) is also sometimes used, but
matrix effects can be a problem.
The method to be used for the determination of metallic constituents in
petroleum is often a matter of individual preference.
9.3.10. Pour Point
The pour point (ASTM D-97, IP 15) is the lowest temperature at which
the fuel oil will ﬂow under speciﬁed conditions. The maximum and"
"minimum pour point temperatures provide a temperature window where
a petroleum product, depending on its thermal history, might appear in
the liquid as well as the solid state. Pour point data can be used to sup-
plement other measurements of cold ﬂow behavior, and the data are par-
ticularly useful for the screening of the effect of wax interaction modiﬁers
on the ﬂow behavior of petroleum. The pour point should not be confused
with the freezing point , which is an index of the lowest temperature at
which the crude oil will ﬂow under speciﬁed conditions. Test methods
(ASTM D-2386, ASTM D-5901, ASTM D-5972, IP 434, IP 435) for the
freezing point are not usually applicable to fuel oil but are more applica-
ble to diesel fuel and aviation fuel.
In the original (and still widely used) test for pour point (ASTM D-97,
IP 15), a sample is cooled at a speciﬁed rate and examined at intervals of
3°C (5.4°F) for ﬂow characteristics. The lowest temperature at which the
movement of the oil is observed is recorded as the pour point. A later test
method (ASTM D-5853) covers two procedures for the determination of
the pour point of petroleum and petroleum products down to –36°C
(–33°F). One method provides a measure of the maximum (upper) pour
point temperature. The second method measures the minimum (lower)
pour point temperature. In these methods, the test specimen is cooled (after
preliminary heating) at a speciﬁed rate and examined at intervals of 3°C
(5.4°F) for ﬂow characteristics. Again, the lowest temperature at which
movement of the test specimen is observed is recorded as the pour point.208 distillate fuel oilIn any determination of the pour point, petroleum that contains wax
produces an irregular ﬂow behavior when the wax begins to separate. Such
petroleum possesses viscosity relationships that are difﬁcult to predict in
fuel line operations. In addition, some waxy petroleum is sensitive to heat
treatment that can also affect the viscosity characteristics. This complex
behavior limits the value of viscosity and pour point tests on waxy petro-
leum. However, laboratory pumpability tests (ASTM D-3245, IP 230) 
are available that give an estimate of minimum handling temperature and
minimum line or storage temperature.
Although the pour point test is still included in many speciﬁcations, it is
not designated for high-boiling fuel oil (ASTM D 396). In fact, although the
failure to ﬂow at the pour point normally is attributed to the separation of
wax from the fuel oil (in the case of waxy crude oil precursors), it also can
be due to the effect of the viscosity of the fuel oil (in the case of naphthenic
crude oil precursors). In addition, the pour point of fuel oil may be inﬂu-
enced by the previous thermal history of the fuel oil. Thus the usefulness
of the pour point test in relation to fuel oil, especially residual fuel oil, may
be open to question.
Perhaps a more important test is the test the cold ﬁlter plugging point .
The cold ﬁlter plugging point is the lowest temperature at which fuel oil
will give trouble-free ﬂow (ASTM D-6371, IP 309). In this test, either a
manual or automated apparatus may be used and the sample is cooled
under speciﬁed conditions, and at intervals of 1°C, is drawn into a pipette
under a controlled vacuum through a standardized wire mesh ﬁlter. As the
sample continues to cool, the procedure is repeated for each 1°C below the
ﬁrst test temperature.The testing is continued until the amount of wax crys-
tals that have separated out of the solution is sufﬁcient to stop or slow down
the ﬂow so that the time taken to ﬁll the pipette exceeds 60s or the fuel
fails to return completely to the test jar before the fuel has cooled by a
further 1°C. The indicated temperature at which the last ﬁltration was 
commenced is recorded as the cold ﬁlter plugging point .
Alternatively, in the low-temperature ﬂow test involving determination
of the ﬁlterability of fuel oil (ASTM D-4539, ASTM D-6426) the results
are indicative of the low-temperature ﬂow performance of distillate fuel
oil. Both tests are useful for the evaluation of fuel oil containing ﬂow
improver additives. In either test method, the temperature of a series of
test specimens of fuel is lowered at a prescribed cooling rate. At the com-
mencing temperature and at each 1°C interval thereafter, a separate 
specimen from the series is ﬁltered through a 17-mm screen until a minimum
low-temperature ﬂow test pass temperature is obtained. The minimum 
low-temperature ﬂow test pass temperature is the lowest temperature,
expressed as a multiple of 1°C, at which a test specimen can be ﬁltered in
60 s or less.test methods 209In another test (ASTM D-2068), the ﬁlter plugging tendency of distillate
fuel oil can be determined by passing a sample at a constant ﬂow rate
(20 ml/min) through a glass ﬁber ﬁlter medium.The pressure drop across the
ﬁlter is monitored during the passage of a ﬁxed volume of test fuel. If a pre-"
"scribed maximum pressure drop is reached before the total volume of fuel
is ﬁltered, the actual volume of fuel ﬁltered at the time of maximum pres-
sure drop is recorded.The apparatus is required to be calibrated at intervals.
9.3.11. Stability
Fuel oil must be capable of storage for many months without signiﬁcant
change and should not break down to form gum or insoluble sediments or
darken in color (ASTM D-156, ASTM D-381, ASTM D-1209, ASTM D-
1500, ASTM D-1544, IP 131). In other words, fuel oil must be stable.
The extent of fuel oil oxidation is determined by measurement of the
hydroperoxide number (ASTM D-6447) and the peroxide number (ASTM
D-3703).Deterioration of fuel oil results in the formation of peroxides as well
as other oxygen-containing compounds,and these numbers are indications of
the quantity of oxidizing constituents present in the sample as determined by
measurement of the compounds that will oxidize potassium iodide.
The determination of hydroperoxide number (ASTM D-6447) does not
use the ozone-depleting substance 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-triﬂuoroethane that
is used for determination of the peroxide number (ASTM D-3703). In this
method, a quantity of sample is contacted with aqueous potassium iodide
(KI) solution in the presence of acid. The hydroperoxides present are
reduced by potassium iodide, liberating an equivalent amount of iodine,
which is quantiﬁed by voltammetric analysis.
The determination of peroxide number (ASTM D-3703) involves 
dissolution of the sample in 1,1,2-trichloro-l,2,2-triﬂuoroethane, and the
solution is contacted with an aqueous potassium iodide solution. The per-
oxides present are reduced by the potassium iodide, whereupon an equiv-
alent amount of iodine is released that is titrated with standard sodium
thiosulfate solution and a starch indicator.
Other tests for storage stability include determination of color forma-
tion and sediment (ASTM D-473, ASTM D-2273, ASTM D-3241, ASTM
D-4625, ASTM D-4870, ASTM D-5304, IP 53, IP 323), in which reactivity
to oxygen at high temperatures is determined by the amount of sediment
formation as well as any color changes.
Straight-run fuel oil fractions from the same crude oil normally are stable
and mutually compatible. However, fuel oil produced from the thermal
cracking and visbreaking operations may be stable by themselves but can
be unstable or incompatible if blended with straight-run fuels and vice
versa. Furthermore, asphaltic deposition may result from the mixing of (dis-
tillate and residual) fuel oils of different origin and treatment, each of which210 distillate fuel oilmay be perfectly satisfactory when used alone. Such fuels are said to be
incompatible, and a spot test (ASTM D-470) is available for determining
the stability and compatibility of fuel oils. Therefore, test procedures are
necessary to predict fuel stability and to ensure a satisfactory level of 
performance by the fuel oil.
In addition, thermal treatment may cause the formation of asphaltene-
type material in fuel oil. The asphaltene fraction (ASTM D-893, ASTM D-
2006,ASTM D-2007,ASTM D-3279,ASTM D-4124,ASTM D-6560, IP 143)
is the highest-molecular- weight, most complex fraction in petroleum. The
asphaltene content is an indicator of the amount of carbonaceous residue
that can be expected during thermal use or further processing (ASTM D-
189, ASTM D-524, ASTM D4530, IP 13, IP 14, IP 398) (Speight, 1999;
Speight, 2001; Speight and Ozum 2002).
In any of the methods for the determination of the asphaltene content
(ASTM D-893, ASTM D-2006, ASTM D-2007, ASTM D-3279, ASTM D-
4124, ASTM D-6560, IP 143), the crude oil or product (such as asphalt) is
mixed with a large excess (usually >30 volumes hydrocarbon per volume of
sample) of low-boiling hydrocarbon such as n-pentane or n-heptane. For an
extremely viscous sample a solvent such as toluene may be used before the
addition of the low-boiling hydrocarbon, but an additional amount of the
hydrocarbon (usually >30 volumes hydrocarbon per volume of solvent)
must be added to compensate for the presence of the solvent. After a speci-
ﬁed time, the insoluble material (the asphaltene fraction) is separated (by
ﬁltration) and dried. The yield is reported as percentage by weight of the
original sample.
It must be recognized that, in any of these tests, different hydrocarbons
(such as n-pentane or n-heptane) will give different yields of the asphal-
tene fraction and if the presence of the solvent is not compensated by use
of additional hydrocarbon the yield will be erroneous. In addition, if the
hydrocarbon is not present in a large excess, the yields of the asphaltene
fraction will vary and will be erroneous (Speight, 1999).
The precipitation number is often equated to the asphaltene content, but
there are several issues that remain obvious in its rejection for this purpose.
For example, the method to determine the precipitation number (ASTM D-"
"91) advocates the use of naphtha for use with black oil or lubricating oil and
the amount of insoluble material (as a % v/v of the sample) is the precipitat-
ing number. In the test, 10 ml of sample is mixed with 90 ml of ASTM precipi-
tation naphtha (that may or may nor have a constant chemical composition)
in a graduated centrifuge cone and centrifuged for 10 min at 600–700 rpm.
The volume of material on the bottom of the centrifuge cone is noted until
repeat centrifugation gives a value within 0.1 ml (the precipitation number).
Obviously, this can be substantially different from the asphaltene content.
Another method, not speciﬁcally described as an asphaltene separation
method, is designed to remove pentane-insoluble constituents by mem-test methods 211brane ﬁltration (ASTM D-4055). In this method, a sample of oil is mixed
with pentane in a volumetric ﬂask, and the oil solution is ﬁltered through
a 0.8-mm membrane ﬁlter. The ﬂask, funnel, and ﬁlter are washed with
pentane to completely transfer any particulates onto the ﬁlter, after which
the ﬁlter (with particulates) is dried and weighed to give the pentane-
insoluble constituents as a percentage by weight of the sample. Particulates
can also be determined by membrane ﬁltration (ASTM D-2276, ASTM D-
5452, ASTM D-6217, IP 415).
The storage stability of fuel oil may also be inﬂuenced by the crude oil
origin, hydrocarbon composition, and reﬁnery treatment (especially if
unsaturated constituents are present). Fuel oil containing unsaturated
hydrocarbons has a greater tendency to form sediment on aging than the
straight-run fuel oils. Unsaturated hydrocarbon constituents can be deter-
mined by the bromine number. (ASTM D-1159, ASTM D-2710, IP 130).
The bromine number is the number of grams of bromine that will react
with 100 g of the sample under the test conditions. The magnitude of the
bromine number is an indication of the quantity of bromine-reactive con-
stituents and is not an identiﬁcation of constituents. It is used as a measure
of aliphatic unsaturation in petroleum samples and of the percentage of
oleﬁns in petroleum distillates boiling up to approximately 315°C (600°F).
In this test, a known weight of the sample dissolved in a speciﬁed solvent
maintained at 0–5°C (32–41°F) is titrated with standard bromide-bromate
solution. Determination of the end point is method- and sample depend-
ent, being inﬂuenced by color.
The presence of reactive compounds of sulfur (e.g., thiophenes), nitro-
gen (pyrroles), and oxygen is also considered to contribute to fuel instabil-
ity (Mushrush and Speight, 1995; Mushrush and Speight, 1998a; Mushrush
and Speight, 1998b; Mushrush et al., 1999).
To ensure a product of satisfactory stability, test procedures are neces-
sary to predict this aspect of quality control. One particular method (ASTM
D-2274) uses short-term, high temperature procedures that are generally
preferred to long-term, lower-temperature conditions. Although the accu-
racy of these empirical tests leaves much to be desired they do provide, with
some background knowledge of the fuel, useful data relating to the fuel’s
storage stability characteristics. And it is not often acknowledged that
higher temperatures can, and often do, change the chemistry of the aging
process, thereby leaving much open to speculation.
9.3.12. Viscosity
The viscosity of a ﬂuid is a measure of its resistance to ﬂow and is expressed
as Saybolt Universal seconds (SUS), Saybolt Furol seconds (SFS), or cen-
tistokes (cSt, kinematic viscosity). Viscosity is one of the more important212 distillate fuel oilheating oil characteristics because it is indicative of the rate at which the
oil will ﬂow in fuel systems and the ease with which it can be atomized in
a given type of burner.
For the determination of the viscosity of petroleum products various 
procedures, such as Saybolt (ASTM D-88) and Engler, are available and
have been in use for many years, all being of an empirical nature, measur-
ing the time taken in seconds for a given volume of fuel to ﬂow through an
oriﬁce of speciﬁed dimensions.
The use of these empirical procedures is being superseded by the more
precise kinematic viscosity method (ASTM D-445, IP 71), in which a ﬁxed
volume of fuel ﬂows through the capillary of a calibrated glass capillary 
viscometer under an accurately reproducible head and at a closely con-
trolled temperature. The result is obtained from the product of the time
taken for the fuel to ﬂow between two etched marks on the capillary tube
and the calibration factor of the viscometer and is reported in centistokes.
Because the viscosity decreases with increasing temperature the tempera-
ture of test must also be reported if the viscosity value is to have any sig-
niﬁcance. For distillate fuel oils the usual test temperature is 38°C (100°F).
The viscosity index (ASTM D-2270, IP 226) is a widely used measure of
the variation in kinematic viscosity due to changes in the temperature of"
"petroleum and petroleum products between 40 and 100°C (104 and 212°F).
For samples of similar kinematic viscosity, the higher the viscosity index the
smaller is the effect of temperature on its kinematic viscosity. The accuracy
of the calculated viscosity index is dependent only on the accuracy of the
original viscosity determination.
9.3.13. Volatility
The volatility of fuel oil must be uniform, from batch to batch, if too-
frequent resetting of burner controls is to be avoided and if maximum 
performance and efﬁciency are to be maintained. Information regarding the
volatility and the proportion of fuel vaporized at any one temperature may
be obtained from the standard distillation procedure (ASTM D-86, IP 123).
The distillation test is signiﬁcant for the distillate fuels because it is essen-
tial that the fuels contain sufﬁcient volatile components to ensure that 
ignition and ﬂame stability can be accomplished easily.
The distillation procedure (ASTM D 86, IP 123) measures the amount
of liquid vaporized and subsequently condensed as the temperature of the
fuel in the distillation ﬂask is raised at a prescribed rate. A record is made
of the volume of distillate collected at speciﬁed temperatures or, conversely,
the temperature at each increment of volume distilled (usually 10% incre-
ments). The temperature at which the ﬁrst drop of condensate is collected
is called the initial boiling point . The end point usually is the highest test methods 213temperature recorded as the bottom of the ﬂask becomes dry. If the sample
is heated above 370°C (698°F), cracking occurs and the data are erroneous.
The test usually is stopped when this point is reached. Some distillations
may be run under reduced pressure (10mmHg) to avoid cracking (ASTM
D-1160). Under these conditions, fuel oil constituents may be distilled up
to temperatures equivalent to 510°C (950°F) at atmospheric pressure.
Speciﬁcations for fuel oil may include limits on the temperatures at
which 10% and 90% of the fuel are distilled by the standard procedure
(ASTM D-396). For kerosene-type fuel oil (ASTM D-1) these values
control the volatility at both ends of the distillation range, whereas for gas
oil (ASTM D-1, ASTM D-2), where the front-end volatility is not so criti-
cal, only the 90% distillation temperature is normally speciﬁed.This ensures
that high-boiling-point components, which are less likely to burn and which
can cause carbon deposition, are excluded from the fuel.
One particular method is speciﬁcally designed for a high-boiling 
petroleum fraction having an initial boiling point greater than 150°C (300°F)
(ASTM D-5236).The method consists of a pot still with a low-pressure drop
entrainment separator operated under total takeoff conditions. The
maximum achievable temperature, up to 565°C (1050°F), is dependent on
the heat tolerance of the charge, but for distillate fuel oil the need to
approach the maximum temperature is unnecessary. In this method, a
weighed volume of the sample is distilled at pressures between 0.1 and 50
mmHg at speciﬁed distillation rates. Fractions are taken at preselected tem-
peratures with records being made of the vapor temperature, the operating
pressure, and any other variables deemed necessary. From the mass and
density of each fraction distillation. yields by mass and volume can be 
calculated.
The boiling range distribution of certain fuel oils can be determined by
gas chromatography (ASTM D-6352). This test method is applicable to
petroleum distillate fractions with an initial boiling point of <700°C
(<1292°F) at atmospheric pressure. The test method is not applicable to
products containing low-molecular-weight components, for example,
naphtha, reformate, gasoline, residuum, and petroleum itself, and should not
be used for materials that contain heterogeneous components such as 
alcohols, ethers, esters, or acids or residue. In the method, a nonpolar open
tubular capillary gas chromatographic column is used to elute the hydro-
carbon components of the sample in order of increasing boiling point. A
sample aliquot diluted with a viscosity-reducing solvent is introduced into
the chromatographic system, and the column oven temperature is raised at
a speciﬁed linear rate to effect separation of the hydrocarbon components.
Retention times of known normal parafﬁn hydrocarbons spanning the
scope of the test method are used for normalizing the retention times of
the constituents of the fuel oil.214 distillate fuel oil9.3.14. Water and Sediment
Considerable importance is attached to the presence of water or sediment
in fuel oil because they lead to difﬁculties in use such as corrosion of equip-
ment and blockages in fuel lines.
The sediment consists of ﬁnely divided solids that may be drilling mud
or sand or scale picked up during the transport of the oil or may consist of
chlorides derived from evaporation of brine droplets in the oil. The solids
may be dispersed in the oil or carried in water droplets. Sediment in"
"petroleum can lead to serious plugging of the equipment, corrosion due to
chloride decomposition, and a lowering of residual fuel quality.
In any form, water and sediment are highly undesirable in fuel oil and
the relevant tests involving distillation (ASTM D-95, ASTM D-4006, IP 74,
IP 358), centrifuging (ASTM D-96, ASTM D-4007), extraction (ASTM D-
473, IP 53), and the Karl Fischer titration (ASTM D-4377, ASTM D-4928,
IP 356, IP 386, IP 438, IP 439) are regarded as important in examinations
of quality.
The Karl Fischer test method (ASTM D-1364,ASTM D-6304) covers the
direct determination of water in petroleum products. In the test, the sample
injection in the titration vessel can be performed on a volumetric or gravi-
metric basis. Viscous samples can be analyzed with a water vaporizer acces-
sory that heats the sample in the evaporation chamber, and the vaporized
water is carried into the Karl Fischer titration cell by a dry inert carrier gas.
Water and sediment can be determined simultaneously (ASTM D-96,
ASTM D-4007, IP 359) by the centrifuge method. Known volumes of the
fuel oil and solvent are placed in a centrifuge tube and heated to 60°C
(140°F). After centrifugation, the volume of the sediment and water layer
at the bottom of the tube is read. For fuel oil that contains wax, a temper-
ature of 71°C (160°F) or higher may be required to completely melt the
wax crystals so that they are not measured as sediment.
Sediment is also determined by an extraction method (ASTM D-473, IP
53) or by membrane ﬁltration (ASTM D-4807). In the former method
(ASTM D-473, IP 53), an oil sample contained in a refractory thimble is
extracted with hot toluene until the residue reaches a constant mass. In the
latter test, the sample is dissolved in hot toluene and ﬁltered under vacuum
through a 0.45- mm-porosity membrane ﬁlter. The ﬁlter with residue is
washed, dried, and weighed.

RESIDUAL FUEL OIL
10.1. INTRODUCTION
The term fuel oil is applied not only to distillate products ( distillate fuel oil ,
Chapter 9) but also to residual material, which is distinguished from distil-
late type fuel oil by boiling range and, hence, is referred to as residual fuel
oil(ASTM D-396).
Thus residual fuel oil is fuel oil that is manufactured from the distillation"
"residuum, and the term includes all residual fuel oils, including fuel oil
obtained by visbreaking as well as by blending residual products from other
operations (Gruse and Stevens, 1960; Guthrie, 1967; Kite and Pegg, 1973;
Weissermel and Arpe, 1978; Francis and Peters, 1980; Hoffman, 1983;Austin,
1984; Chenier, 1992; Hoffman and McKetta, 1993; Hemighaus, 1998; Warne,
1998; Speight, 1999; Charlot and Claus, 2000; Heinrich and Duée, 2000). The
various grades of heavy fuel oils are produced to meet rigid speciﬁcations
to ensure suitability for their intended purpose.
Detailed analysis of residual products, such as residual fuel oil, is more
complex than the analysis of lower-molecular-weight liquid products. As
with other products, there are a variety of physical property measurements
that are required to determine whether the residual fuel oil meets speciﬁ-
cation, but the range of molecular types present in petroleum products
increases signiﬁcantly with an increase in the molecular weight (i.e., an
increase in the number of carbon atoms per molecule). Therefore, charac-
terization measurements or studies cannot, and do not, focus on the 
identiﬁcation of speciﬁc molecular structures. The focus tends to be on
molecular classes (parafﬁns, naphthenes, aromatics, polycyclic compounds,
and polar compounds).
Several tests that are usually applied to the lower-molecular-weight
colorless (or light-colored) products are not applied to residual fuel oil.
For example, test methods such as those designed for the determination
of the aniline point (or mixed aniline point) (ASTM D-611, IP 2) and
the cloud point (ASTM D-2500, ASTM D-5771, ASTM D-5772, ASTM
D-5773) can suffer from visibility effects because of the color of the fuel
oil.
21710.2. PRODUCTION AND PROPERTIES
Visbreaking (viscosity reduction, viscosity breaking) is the most widely used
process for the production of residual fuel oil. It is a relatively mild thermal
cracking operation used to reduce the viscosity of residua (Bland and
Davidson, 1967; Ballard et al., 1992; Speight and Ozum, 2002). Residua are
sometimes blended with lighter heating oils to produce residual fuel oil of
acceptable viscosity. By reducing the viscosity of the nonvolatile fraction,
visbreaking reduces the amount of the more valuable light heating oil that
is required for blending to meet the fuel oil speciﬁcations. The process is
also used to reduce the pour point of a waxy residue.
In the visbreaking process, a residuum is passed through a furnace where
it is heated to a temperature of approximately 480°C (895°F) under an
outlet pressure of about 100 psi (Speight, 1999; Speight and Ozum, 2002).
The heating coils in the furnace are arranged to provide a soaking section
of low heat density, where the charge remains until the visbreaking 
reactions are completed. The cracked products are then passed into a ﬂash 
distillation chamber. The overhead material from this chamber is then 
fractionated to produce a low-quality gasoline as an overhead product 
and light gas oil as bottoms. The liquid products from the ﬂash chamber 
are cooled with a gas oil ﬂux and then sent to a vacuum fractionator. This
yields a heavy gas oil distillate and a residuum of reduced viscosity.
A quench oil may also be used to terminate the reactions. A 5–10% by
weight or by volume conversion of atmospheric residua to naphtha 
is usually sufﬁcient to afford at least an approximate ﬁvefold reduction in
viscosity. Reduction in viscosity is also accompanied by a reduction in the
pour point.
The reduction in viscosity of residua tends to reach a limiting value with
conversion, although the total product viscosity can continue to decrease
but other properties will be affected. Sediment (which is predominantly
organic but may contain some mineral matter) may also form—a crucial
property for residual fuel oil—and conditions should be chosen so that sed-
iment formation is minimal, if it occurs at all. When shipment of the vis-
breaker product by pipeline is the process objective, addition of a diluent
such as gas condensate can be used to achieve a further reduction in 
viscosity. Recovery of the diluent after pipelining is an option.
The signiﬁcance of the measured properties of residual fuel oil is depen-
dent to a large extent on the ultimate uses of the fuel oil. Such uses include
steam generation for various processes as well as electrical power genera-
tion and propulsion. Corrosion, ash deposition, atmospheric pollution, and
product contamination are side effects of the use of residual fuel oil, and in
particular cases properties such as vanadium, sodium, and sulfur contents
may be signiﬁcant.218 residual fuel oilProblems of handling and storage may also arise, particularly with
higher-boiling fuel oil, because at ambient temperatures this type of fuel oil
may be viscous and even approach a semisolid state. Although such fuel oil
is usually stored in heated tanks, test methods to determine the low-tem-"
"perature behavior of the fuel oil are necessary. In addition, because viscous
or semisolid fuel oil should be preheated to obtain the correct injection
(atomizing) conditions for efﬁcient combustion, test methods that describe
viscosity are also necessary.
10.3. TEST METHODS
Test methods of interest for hydrocarbon analysis of residual fuel oil include
tests that measure physical properties such as elemental analysis, density,
refractive index, molecular weight, and boiling range. There may also be
some emphasis on methods that are used to measure chemical composition
and structural analysis, but these methods may not be as deﬁnitive as they
are for other petroleum products.
Testing residual fuel oil does not suffer from the issues that are associ-
ated with sample volatility, but the test methods are often sensitive to the
presence of gas bubbles in the fuel oil. An air release test is available for
application to lubricating oil (ASTM D-3427, IP 313) and may be applied,
with modiﬁcation, to residual fuel oil. However, with dark-colored samples,
it may be difﬁcult to determine whether all air bubbles have been elimi-
nated. And, as with the analysis and testing of other petroleum products,
the importance of correct sampling of fuel oil cannot be overemphasized,
because no proper assessment of quality can be made unless the data are
obtained on truly representative samples (ASTM D-270, IP 51).
10.3.1. Ash
The ash formed by the combustion of fuel oil (ASTM D-482, ASTM 
D-2415, IP 4) is, as deﬁned for other products, the inorganic residue, free
from carbonaceous matter, remaining after ignition in air of the residual
fuel oil at fairly high temperatures. The ash content is not directly equated
to mineral content but can be converted to mineral matter content by the
use of appropriate formulae.
Residual fuel oil often contains varying amounts of ash-forming con-
stituents (but seldom more than 0.2% w/w) such as organometallic com-
plexes that are soluble, or inherent, in petroleum, from mineral matter from
oil-bearing strata, or from contact of the crude oil with pipelines and storage
tanks during transportation and subsequent handling. Additives used to
improve particular fuel properties and carryover from reﬁning processestest methods 219may also contribute to the ultimate amount of mineral matter in the fuel
oil and may present an inﬂated measurement of the ash formed by 
combustion of the sample. Thus, although the total amounts of ash-forming
constituents in different fuel oils may be similar, the compositions of 
the mineral constituents will depend on the crude oil origin as well as on
the handling of the respective fuel oils. These constituents ultimately con-
centrate in the distillation residue, and so their presence will be reﬂected in
the fuel oil ash.
The presence of sodium and vanadium complexes in the fuel oil ash can,
under certain plant operating conditions, result in considerable harm to the
equipment. Spalling and ﬂuxing of refractory linings is associated with the
presence of sodium in the fuel. Above a certain threshold temperature,
which will vary from fuel to fuel, the oil ash will adhere to boiler super-
heater tubes and gas turbine blades, thus reducing the thermal efﬁciency of
the plant. At higher temperatures, molten complexes of vanadium, sodium,
and sulfur are produced that will corrode all currently available metals used
in the construction of these parts of the plant. The presence of trace
amounts (ASTM D-1318) of vanadium (ASTM D-1548, IP 285, IP 286) in
fuel oil used in glass manufacture can affect the indicator of the ﬁnished
product.
10.3.2. Asphaltene Content
The asphaltene fraction (ASTM D-893, ASTM D-2006, ASTM D-2007,
ASTM D-3279,ASTM D-4124,ASTM D-6560, IP 143) is the highest-molec-
ular-weight, most complex fraction in petroleum. The asphaltene content
gives an indication of the amount of coke that can be expected during expo-
sure to thermal conditions (Speight, 1999; Speight, 2001, Speight and Ozum
2002).
In any of the methods for the determination of the asphaltene content
(Speight et al., 1984), the residual fuel oil is mixed with a large excess
(usually >30 volumes hydrocarbon per volume of sample) of low-boiling
hydrocarbon such as n-pentane or n-heptane. For an extremely viscous
sample a solvent such as toluene may be used before the addition of the
low-boiling hydrocarbon, but an additional amount of the hydrocarbon
(usually >30 volumes hydrocarbon per volume of solvent) must be added
to compensate for the presence of the solvent. After a speciﬁed time, the
insoluble material (the asphaltene fraction) is separated (by ﬁltration) and
dried. The yield is reported as percentage (% w/w) of the original sample.
In any of these tests, different hydrocarbons (such as n-pentane or n-
heptane) will give different yields of the asphaltene fraction, and if the pres-
ence of the solvent is not compensated by use of additional hydrocarbon"
"the yield will be erroneous. In addition, if the hydrocarbon is not present220 residual fuel oilin a large excess, the yields of the asphaltene fraction will vary and will be
erroneous (Speight, 1999).
Another method, not speciﬁcally described as an asphaltene separation
method, is designed to remove pentane-insoluble constituents by mem-
brane ﬁltration (ASTM D-4055). In the method, a sample of oil is mixed
with pentane in a volumetric ﬂask, and the oil solution is ﬁltered through
a 0.8-mm membrane ﬁlter. The ﬂask, funnel, and ﬁlter are washed with
pentane to completely transfer any particulates onto the ﬁlter, after which
the ﬁlter (with particulates) is dried and weighed to give the pentane-
insoluble constituents as a percentage by weight of the sample.
Particulates can also be determined by membrane ﬁltration (ASTM 
D-2276, ASTM D-5452, ASTM D-6217, IP 415).
The precipitation number is often equated to the asphaltene content, but
there are several issues that remain obvious in its rejection for this purpose.
For example, the method to determine the precipitation number (ASTM
D-91) advocates the use of naphtha for use with black oil or lubricating oil,
and the amount of insoluble material (as a % v/v of the sample) is the pre-
cipitating number. In the test, 10 ml of sample is mixed with 90 ml of ASTM
precipitation naphtha (which may or may nor have a constant chemical
composition) in a graduated centrifuge cone and centrifuged for 10 min at
600–700 rpm. The volume of material on the bottom of the centrifuge cone
is noted until repeat centrifugation gives a value within 0.1 ml (the pre-
cipitation number). Obviously, this can be substantially different from 
the asphaltene content.
If the residual fuel oil is produced by a thermal process such as vis-
breaking, it may also be necessary to determine whether toluene-insoluble
material is present by the methods, or modiﬁcations thereof, used to deter-
mine the toluene-insoluble material of tar and pitch (ASTM D-4072,ASTM
D-4312). In these methods, a sample is digested at 95°C (203°F) for 25 min
and then extracted with hot toluene in an alundum thimble. The extraction
time is 18h (ASTM D-4072) or 2h (ASTM D-4312). The insoluble matter
is dried and weighed.
10.3.3. Caloriﬁc (Heat of Combustion) Value
The caloriﬁc value (heat of combustion) of residual fuel oil (ASTM D-240,
IP 12) is lower than that of lower-boiling fuel oil (and other liquid fuels)
because of the lower atomic hydrogen-to-carbon ratio and the incidence of
greater amounts of less combustible material, such as water and sediment,
and generally higher levels of sulfur.
For most residual fuel oils, the range of caloriﬁc value is relatively narrow
and limits are not usually included in the speciﬁcations.When precise deter-
minations are not essential, values of sufﬁcient accuracy may be derivedtest methods 221from calculations based on measurable physical properties (ASTM D-
6446). In this test method, the net heat of combustion is calculated from the
density and sulfur and hydrogen content, but this calculation is justiﬁable
only when the fuel belongs to a well-deﬁned class for which a relationship
between these quantities has been derived from accurate experimental
measurements on representative samples. Thus the hydrogen content
(ASTM D-1018, ASTM D-1217, ASTM D-1298, ASTM D-3701, ASTM D-
4052, ASTM D-4808, ASTM D-5291, IP 160, IP 365), density (ASTM D-
129, ASTM D-1250, ASTM D-1266, ASTM D-2622, ASTM D-3120, IP 61,
IP 107), and sulfur content (ASTM D-2622, ASTM D-3120, ASTM D-3246,
ASTM D-4294,ASTM D-5453,ASTM D-5623, IP 336, IP 373) of the sample
are determined by experimental test methods and the net heat of combus-
tion is calculated with the values obtained by these test methods based on
reported correlations.
10.3.4. Carbon Residue
The propensity of residual fuel oil for carbon formation and deposition under
thermal conditions may be indicated by the one or more of three carbon
residue tests.
Thus the speciﬁcations for the allowable amounts of carbon residue by the
Conradson carbon residue test (ASTM D-189, IP 13), the Ramsbottom
carbon residue test (ASTM D-524,IP 14),or the microcarbon carbon residue
test (ASTM D-4530, IP 398) may be included in inspection data for fuel oil.
In the Conradson carbon residue test (ASTM D-189, IP 13), a weighed
quantity of sample is placed in a crucible and subjected to destructive dis-
tillation for a ﬁxed period of severe heating. At the end of the speciﬁed
heating period, the test crucible containing the carbonaceous residue is
cooled in a desiccator and weighed and the residue is reported as a per-
centage (% w/w) of the original sample (Conradson carbon residue). In the
Ramsbottom carbon residue test (ASTM D-524, IP 14), the sample is
weighed into a glass bulb that has a capillary opening and is placed into a
furnace (at 550°C/1022°F).The volatile matter is distilled from the bulb, and"
"the nonvolatile matter that remains in the bulb cracks to form thermal coke.
After a speciﬁed heating period, the bulb is removed from the bath, cooled
in a desiccator, and weighed to report the residue (Ramsbottom carbon
residue) as a percentage (% w/w) of the original sample. In the microcar-
bon residue test (ASTM D-4530, IP 398), a weighed quantity of the sample
placed in a glass vial is heated to 500°C (932°F) under an inert (nitrogen)
atmosphere in a controlled manner for a speciﬁc time and the carbonaceous
residue [ carbon residue (micro) ] is reported as a percentage (% w/w) of the
original sample.222 residual fuel oilThe data produced by the microcarbon test (ASTM D-4530, IP 398) are
equivalent to those produced by the Conradson carbon method (ASTM D-
189 IP 13). However, this microcarbon test method offers better control of
test conditions and requires a smaller sample. Up to 12 samples can be run
simultaneously. This test method is applicable to petroleum and to petro-
leum products that partially decompose on distillation at atmospheric pres-
sure and is applicable to a variety of samples that generate a range of yields
(0.01% w/w to 30% w/w) of thermal coke.
In any of the carbon residue tests, ash-forming constituents (ASTM
D-482) or nonvolatile additives present in the sample will be included in
the total carbon residue reported, leading to higher carbon residue values
and erroneous conclusions about the coke-forming propensity of the
sample.
The data give an indication of the amount of coke that will be formed
during exposure of the residual fuel oil to thermal effects. However, the sig-
niﬁcance of a carbon residue test relative to the combustion characteristics
of the fuel is questionable because the signiﬁcance of the test depends, to
a large extent, on the particular process and handling conditions, speciﬁ-
cally the introduction of residual fuel oil to heat in pipes as it passes to a
furnace.
Other test methods that are used for determining the coking value of tar
and pitch (ASTM D-2416, ASTM D-4715), which indicates the relative
coke-forming properties of tars and pitches, might also be applied to resid-
ual fuel oil. Both test methods are applicable to tar and pitch with an ash
content of ≤0.5% (ASTM D-2415). The former test method (ASTM D-
2416) gives results close to those obtained by the Conradson carbon residue
test (ASTM D-189 IP 13). However, in the latter test method (ASTM D-
4715), a sample of tar (or pitch) is heated for a speciﬁed time at 550 ± 10°C
(1022 ± 18°F) in an electric furnace. The percentage of residue is reported
as the coking value. For residual fuel oil, the temperature of both test
methods can be adjusted to the temperature that the fuel oil might experi-
ence in the pipe to the furnace, with a corresponding adjustment for the
residence time in the pipe.
Finally, a method that is used to determine pitch volatility (ASTM D-
4893) might also be used, on occasion, to determine the nonvolatility of
residual fuel oil. In the method, an aluminum dish containing about 15 g of
accurately weighed sample is introduced into the cavity of a metal block
heated and maintained at 350°C (662°F). After 30 min, during which the
volatiles are swept away from the surface of the sample by preheated 
nitrogen, the residual sample is taken out and allowed to cool down in the
desiccator. Nonvolatility is determined by the sample weight remaining 
and reported as percentage w/w residue.test methods 22310.3.5. Composition
The composition of residual fuel oils is varied and is often reported in the
form of four or ﬁve major fractions as deduced by adsorption chromatog-
raphy (Fig. 10.1 and Fig. 10.2). In the case of cracked feedstocks, thermal
decomposition products (carbenes and carboids) may also be present.
Column chromatography is used for several hydrocarbon type analyses
that involve fractionation of viscous oils (ASTM D-2007, ASTM D-2549),
including residual fuel oil. The former method (ASTM D-2007) advocates
the use of adsorption on clay and clay-silica gel. followed by elution of the
clay with pentane to separate saturates; elution of clay with acetone-toluene
to separate polar compounds; and elution of the silica gel fraction with
toluene to separate aromatic compounds. The latter method (ASTM D-
2549) uses adsorption on a bauxite-silica gel column. Saturates are eluted
with pentane; aromatics are eluted with ether, chloroform, and ethanol.
Several promising chromatographic techniques have been reported for
the analysis of lubricant base oils. Rod thin-layer chromatography (TLC),
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and supercritical ﬂuid
chromatography (SFC) have all been used for fuel oil analysis and base oil
content.
In addition to carbon and hydrogen, high-molecular-weight fractions of
crude oil often contain oxygen compounds, sulfur compounds, and nitrogen224 residual fuel oil"
"Figure 10.1. Separation of a feedstock into four major fractions compounds as well as trace amounts of metal-containing compounds.
Determining the chemical form present for these elements provides addi-
tional important information. Finished products made with viscous oils may
contain additives or contaminants that also require analysis. Thus elemen-
tal analysis also plays an important role in determining the composition of
residual fuel oils.
Carbon and hydrogen are commonly determined by combustion analy-
sis in which the sample is burned in an oxygen stream where carbon is con-
verted to carbon dioxide and hydrogen to water. These compounds are
absorbed, and the composition is determined automatically from mass
increase (ASTM D-5291). Nitrogen may be determined simultaneously.
Sulfur is naturally present in many crude oils and petroleum fractions,
most commonly as organic sulﬁdes and heterocyclic compounds. Residual
fuel oils are variable products whose sulfur contents depend not only on
their crude oil sources but also on the extent of the reﬁnery processing
received by the fuel oil blending components. Sulfur, present in these fuel
oils in varying amounts up to 4 or 5% w/w, is an undesirable constituent,
and many reﬁning steps aim to reduce the sulfur content to improve 
stability and reduce environmentally harmful emissions.
Hydrogen sulﬁde (H 2S) and mercaptans (R-SH) may be produced
during thermal processes such as the visbreaking process and can occur intest methods 225
Figure 10.2. Representation of feedstock fractionation fuel oil with other sulfur compounds that concentrate in the distillation
residue. Without any further processing, such as hydroﬁning and caustic
washing (Speight, 1999; Speight, 2000), these sulfur compounds remain in
the fuel oil. The sulfur content of fuel oil obtained from petroleum residua
and the atmospheric pollution arising from the use of these fuel oils is an
important factor, and the increasing insistence on a low-sulfur-content fuel
oil has increased the value of low-sulfur petroleum.
A considerable number of tests are available to estimate the sulfur in
petroleum or to study its effect on various products, particularly hydrogen
sulﬁde (ASTM D-5705, ASTM D-6021), that can result as a product of
thermal processes, such as visbreaking. Hydrogen sulﬁde dissolved in petro-
leum is normally determined by absorption of the hydrogen sulﬁde in a suit-
able solution that is subsequently analyzed chemically (Doctor method)
(ASTM D-4952, IP 30) or by the formation of cadmium sulfate (IP 103).
The Doctor test measures the amount of sulfur available to react with
metallic surfaces at the temperature of the test. The rates of reaction are
metal type-, temperature-, and time dependent. In the test, a sample is
treated with copper powder at 149°C or 300°F. The copper powder is ﬁl-
tered from the mixture. Active sulfur is calculated from the difference
between the sulfur contents of the sample (ASTM D-129) before and after
treatment with copper.
Of all the elements present in a normal residual fuel oil, vanadium,
sodium, and sulfur contribute most to difﬁculties and problems that may
arise in the industrial application of fuel oils. Sulfur contributes to the
increasing problem of atmospheric pollution when sulfur oxides, produced
on combustion of high-sulfur fuel oils, are emitted into the surrounding
atmosphere of densely populated industrial areas or large towns. In speciﬁc
applications fuel oil desulfurization may have to be used to comply with air
pollution legislation.
The methods used to measure sulfur content vary depending on the
sulfur concentration, viscosity or boiling range, and presence of interfering
elements.
For the determination of sulfur contents of residual fuels a variety of
procedures are available. The bomb (ASTM D-129, IP 61) and quartz tube
(ASTM D-l55, IP 63) combustion methods have long been established.
Other, more rapid techniques are becoming increasingly available, includ-
ing high-temperature combustion (ASTM D-1552), X-ray absorption and
ﬂuorescence methods, and the Schoniger oxygen ﬂask procedure.
The bomb method for sulfur determination (ASTM D-129) uses sample
combustion in oxygen and conversion of the sulfur to barium sulfate, which
is determined by mass. This method is suitable for samples containing
0.1–5.0% w/w sulfur and can be used for most low-volatility petroleum
products. Elements that produce residues insoluble in hydrochloric acid226 residual fuel oilinterfere with this method—this includes aluminum, calcium, iron, lead, and
silicon plus minerals such as asbestos, mica, and silica—and an alternate
method (ASTM D-1552) is preferred. This method describes three proce-
dures: the sample is ﬁrst pyrolyzed in either an induction furnace or a resist-
ance furnace; the sulfur is then converted to sulfur dioxide; and the sulfur
dioxide is either titrated with potassium iodate-starch reagent or analyzed"
"by infrared spectroscopy.This method is generally suitable for samples con-
taining from 0.06 to 8.0% w/w sulfur that distill at temperatures above
177°C (351°F).
Two methods describe the use of X ray techniques for sulfur determi-
nation and can be applied to the determination of sulfur in samples with
sulfur content of 0.001–5.0% w/w (ASTM D-2622, ASTM D-4294). Oil vis-
cosity is not a critical factor with these two methods, but interference may
affect test results when chlorine, phosphorus, heavy metals, and possibly
silicon are present. A method is also available for very low sulfur concen-
trations (ASTM D-4045). This is normally used for lower-viscosity fractions
but may be used for some viscous oils that boil below 371°C (700°F). The
method is designed to measure sulfur in the range of 0.02 to 10 ppm. Sulfur
may also be determined along with metals (ASTM D-4927, ASTM D-4951,
ASTM D-5185).
Nitrogen is present in residual fuel oils and is also a component of many
additives used in petroleum products, including oxidation and corrosion
inhibitors and dispersants. There are four ASTM standards describing ana-
lytical methods for nitrogen in viscous oils. The ﬁrst (ASTM D-3228) is a
standard wet chemical method and is useful for determining the nitrogen
content of most viscous oils in the range from 0.03 to 0.10% w/w nitrogen.
The other three methods are instrumental techniques; one involves nitro-
gen reduction, and the other two involve nitrogen oxidation. One method
(ASTM D-3431) is an instrumental method where nitrogen is pyrolyzed
under reducing conditions and converted to ammonia, which is measured
coulometrically. This method is very useful in assessing feeds for catalytic
hydrogenation processes, where nitrogen may act as a catalyst poison.
Another method (ASTM D-4629) is useful for samples containing 0.3–100
ppm nitrogen and boiling higher than 400°C (752°F) but with viscosities of
10 cSt or less. In this method, organic nitrogen is converted to nitric oxide
(NO) and then to excited nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) by reaction with oxygen
and ozone. Energy emitted during decay of the excited nitrogen dioxide is
measured with a photomultiplier tube. There is a method (ASTM D-5762)
that is complementary to this one and is suitable for higher-viscosity viscous
samples that contain from 40 to 10,000 ppm nitrogen.
The viscous fractions of crude oil often contain metals such as iron,
nickel, and vanadium. Catalytic reﬁning processes are often sensitive to
metal contamination and, therefore, the type and quantity of metals musttest methods 227be determined. In other cases such as lubricating oils, some metals are parts
of compounds added to the petroleum component to enhance performance.
A standard wet chemical analysis (ASTM D-811) is available for deter-
mination of aluminum, barium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, silicon,
sodium, tin, and zinc. The procedure involves a series of chemical separa-
tions with speciﬁc elemental analysis performed by using appropriate
gravimetric or volumetric analyses.
The most commonly used methods for determining metal content in
viscous oils are spectroscopic techniques. In one such method (ASTM D-
4628), the sample is diluted in kerosene and burned in an acetylene-nitrous
oxide ﬂame of an M spectrophotometer. The method is suitable for oils in
the lubricating oil viscosity range. It is designed to measure barium at con-
centrations of 0.005–1.0% w/w, calcium and magnesium at 0.002–0.3% w/w,
and zinc at 0.002–0.2% w/w. Higher metal concentrations, such as are present
in additives, can be determined by dilution. Lower concentrations in the range
of 10–50ppm can also be determined; however, the precision is poorer. An
alternate test method (ASTM D-4927) is designed for unused lube oils con-
taining metals at concentration levels of 0.03–1.0% w/w and sulfur at
0.01–2.0% w/w. Higher concentrations can be determined after dilution.
A third technique (ASTM D-4951) is used to determine barium, boron,
calcium, copper, magnesium, phosphorus, sulfur, and zinc in unused lubri-
cating oils and additive packages. Elements can generally be determined at
concentrations of 0.01–1.0% w/w. The sample is diluted in mixed xylenes or
other solvents containing an internal standard. The ICP method (ASTM D-
708, ASTM D-5185) is also available. Sensitivity and useable range varies
from one element to another, but the method is generally applicable from
1 to l00 ppm for contaminants and up to 1000–9000 ppm for additive 
elements:
Additive Elements Contaminant Elements
calcium aluminum lead sodium
magnesium barium manganese tin
phosphorus boron molybdenum titanium
potassium chromium nickel vanadium
sulfur copper silicon
zinc iron silver
Two procedures are described whereby either the sample is treated with
acid to decompose the organic material and dissolve the metals or, alter-
natively, the sample is dissolved in an organic solvent. The ﬁrst method is"
"sensitive down to about 1 ppm; the precision statement is based on samples
containing 1–10 ppm iron, 10–l00 ppm nickel, or 50–500 ppm vanadium228 residual fuel oil(ASTM D-5708). The second method provides an alternate method for
analysis of crude oils and residuum (ASTM D-5863). The sensitivity range
is 3.0–10 ppm for iron, 0.5–100 ppm for nickel, 0.1–20 ppm for sodium, and
0.5–500 ppm for vanadium. Higher concentrations may be determined after
dilution.
A variety of miscellaneous elements can also occur in residual fuel oil
fraction For example, chlorine is present as a chlorinated hydrocarbon and
can be determined (ASTM D-808, ASTM D-1317, ASTM D-6160). A rapid
test method suitable for analysis of samples by nontechnical personnel is
also available (ASTM D-5384) that uses a commercial test kit where the
oil sample is reacted with metallic sodium to convert organic halogens to
halide, which is titrated with mercuric nitrate using diphenyl carbazone 
indicator. Iodides and bromides are reported as chloride.
Phosphorus is a common component of additives and appears most com-
monly as a zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate or a tri-aryl phosphate ester, but
other forms also occur. Two wet chemical methods are available, one of
which (ASTM D-1091) describes an oxidation procedure that converts
phosphorus to aqueous orthophosphate anion. This is then determined by
mass as magnesium pyrophosphate or photochemically as molybdi-
vanadophosphoric acid. In an alternate test (ASTM D-4047), samples are
oxidized to phosphate with zinc oxide, dissolved in acid, precipitated as
quinoline phosphomolybdate, treated with excess standard alkali, and back-
titrated with standard acid. Both of these methods are primarily used for
referee samples. Phosphorus is most commonly determined with X-ray 
ﬂuorescence (ASTM D-4927) or ICP (ASTM D-4951).
Correlative methods are derived relationships between fundamental
chemical properties of a substance and measured physical or chemical 
properties. They provide information about an oil from readily measured
properties (ASTM D-2140,ASTM D-2501,ASTM D-2502,ASTM D-3238).
One method (ASTM D-2501) describes the calculation of the viscosity-
gravity coefﬁcient (VGC)—a parameter derived from kinematic viscosity
and density that has been found to relate to the saturate/aromatic compo-
sition. Correlations between the viscosity-gravity coefﬁcient (or molecular
weight and density) and refractive index to calculate carbon type composi-
tion in percentage of aromatic, naphthenic, and parafﬁnic carbon atoms are
used to estimate of the number of aromatic and naphthenic rings present
(ASTM D-2140, ASTM D-3238).
Another method (ASTM D-2502) permits estimation of molecular
weight from kinematic viscosity measurements at 38 and 99°C (100 and
210°F) (ASTM D-445). It is applicable to samples with molecular weights
in the range from 250 to 700 but should not be applied indiscriminately for
oils that represent extremes of composition for which different constants
are derived (Moschopedis et al., 1976).test methods 229However, data from correlative methods must not be confused with
more fundamental measurements obtained by chromatography or mass
spectroscopy. Correlative methods can be extremely useful when used to
follow changes in a hydrocarbon mixture during processing. They are less
reliable when comparing materials of different origin and can be very 
misleading when applied to typical or unusual compositions.
A major use for gas chromatography for hydrocarbon analysis has been
simulated distillation, as discussed above. Other gas chromatographic
methods have been developed for contaminant analysis (ASTM D-3524,
ASTM D-4291) 
The aromatic content of fuel oil is a key property that can affect a
variety of other properties including viscosity, stability, and compatibility
with other fuel oil or blending stock. Existing methods for this work use
physical measurements and require suitable standards. Thus methods have
been standardized with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for hydrocar-
bon characterization (ASTM D-4808, ASTM D-5291, ASTM D-5292). The
nuclear magnetic resonance method is simpler and more precise. Proce-
dures are described that cover light distillates with a 15–260°C boiling
range, middle distillates and gas oils with boiling ranges of 200–370°C and
370–510°C, and residuum boiling above 510°C. One of the methods (ASTM
D-5292) is applicable to a wide range of hydrocarbon oils that are com-
pletely soluble in chloroform and carbon tetrachloride at ambient tem-
perature. The data obtained by this method can be used to evaluate
changes in aromatic contents of hydrocarbon oils resulting from process
changes.
High ionizing voltage mass spectrometry (ASTM D-2786, ASTM D-
3239) is also employed for compositional analysis of residual fuel oil.
These methods require preliminary separation with elution chromatogra-
phy (ASTM D-2549). A third method (ASTM D-2425) may be applicable"
"to some residual fuel oil samples in the lower molecular weight range.
10.3.6. Density (Speciﬁc Gravity)
Density or speciﬁc gravity (relative density) is used whenever conversions
must be made between mass (weight) and volume measurements. This
property is often used in combination with other test results to predict oil
quality, and several methods are available for measurement of density (or
speciﬁc gravity). However, the density (speciﬁc gravity) (ASTM D-1298, IP
160) is probably of least importance in determining fuel oil performance
but it is used in product control, in weight-volume relationships, and in the
calculation of caloriﬁc value (heating value).
Two of the methods (ASTM D-287, ASTM D-1298) use an immersed
hydrometer for measurement of density. The former method (ASTM 230 residual fuel oilD-287) provides the results as API gravity. Two other methods (ASTM D-
1480, ASTM D-1481) use a pycnometer to measure density or speciﬁc
gravity and have the advantage of requiring a smaller sample size and can
be used at higher temperatures than is normal providing that the vapor
pressure of the liquid does not exceed speciﬁc limits at the temperature of
the test. Two other test methods (ASTM D-4052, ASTM D-5002) measure
density with a digital density analyzer. This device determines density by
analysis of the change in oscillating frequency of a sample tube when ﬁlled
with the test sample.
Another test method (ASTM D-4052) covers the determination of the
density or speciﬁc gravity of viscous oils, such as residual fuel oil, that are
liquid at test temperatures between 15 and 35°C (59 and 95°F). However,
application of the method is restricted to liquids with vapor pressures below
600 mmHg and viscosity below 15,000 cSt at the temperature of test. In
addition, and this is crucial for residual fuel oil, this test method should not
be applied to samples so dark in color that the absence of air bubbles in
the sample cell cannot be established with certainty.
10.3.7. Elemental Analysis
Elemental analysis of fuel oil often plays a more major role that it may
appear to do in the lower-boiling products.Aromaticity (through the atomic
hydrogen-to-carbon ratio), sulfur content, nitrogen content, oxygen content,
and metals content are all important features that can inﬂuence use of 
residual fuel oil.
Carbon content and hydrogen content can be determined simultaneously
by the method designated for coal and coke (ASTM D-3178) or by the
method designated for municipal solid waste (ASTM E-777). However, as
with any analytical method, the method chosen for the analysis may be
subject to the peculiarities or character of the feedstock under investiga-
tion and should be assessed in terms of accuracy and reproducibility. The
methods that are designated for elemental analysis are:
1.Carbon and hydrogen content (ASTM D-1018, ASTM D-3178, ASTM
D-3343, ASTM D-3701, ASTM D-5291, ASTM E-777, IP 338);
2.Nitrogen content (ASTM D-3179, ASTM D-3228, ASTM D-3431,
ASTM E-148, ASTM E-258, ASTM D-5291, and ASTM E-778);
3.Oxygen content (ASTM E-385), and 
4.Sulfur content (ASTM D-124, ASTM D-129, ASTM D-139, ASTM D-
1266, ASTM D-1552, ASTM D-1757, ASTM D-2622, ASTM D-2785,
ASTM D-3120, ASTM D-3177, ASTM D-4045 and ASTM D-4294,
ASTM E-443, IP 30, IP 61, IP 103, IP 104, IP 107, IP 154, IP 243).test methods 231The hydrogen content of fuel oil can also be measured by low-resolution
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (ASTM D-3701, ASTM D-4808). The
method is claimed to provide a simple and more precise alternative to exist-
ing test methods, speciﬁcally combustion techniques (ASTM D-5291), for
determining the hydrogen content of a variety of petroleum-related 
materials.
Nitrogen occurs in residua and, therefore, in residual fuel oil and causes
serious environmental problems as a result, especially when the levels
exceed 0.5% by weight, as happens often in residua. In addition to the
chemical character of the nitrogen, the amount of nitrogen in a feedstock
determines the severity of the process, the hydrogen requirements, and to
some extent, the sediment formation and deposition.
The determination of nitrogen in petroleum products is performed reg-
ularly by the Kjeldahl method (ASTM D-3228), the Dumas method, and
the microcoulometric (ASTM D-3431) method. The chemiluminescence
method is the most recent technique applied to nitrogen analysis for petro-
leum and is used to determine the amount of chemically bound nitrogen in
liquid samples.
In the method, the samples are introduced to the oxygen-rich atmosphere
of a pyrolysis tube maintained at 975°C (1785°F). Nitrogen in the sample is
converted to nitric oxide during combustion, and the combustion products
are dried by passage through magnesium perchlorate [Mg(ClO 4)2] before
entering the reaction chamber of a chemiluminescence detector. In the
detector, ozone reacts with the nitric oxide to form excited nitrogen dioxide:
NO +O3=NO 2* +O2"
"Photoemission occurs as the excited nitrogen dioxide reverts to the ground
state:
NO 2* =NO 2+hn
The emitted light is monitored by a photomultiplier tube to yield a measure
of the nitrogen content of the sample. Quantitation is based on comparison
with the response for carbazole in toluene standards.
Oxygen is one of the ﬁve (C, H, N, O, and S) major elements in fuel oil
but rarely exceeds 1.5% by weight, unless oxidation has occurred during
transportation and storage. Many petroleum products do not specify a par-
ticular oxygen content, but if the oxygen compounds are present as acidic
compounds such as phenols (Ar-OH) and naphthenic acids (cycloalkyl-
COOH), they are controlled in different speciﬁcations by a variety of tests.
The total acidity (ASTM D-974, IP 139, IP 273) is determined for many
products, especially fuels and fuel oil. Oxygen-containing impurities in the232 residual fuel oilform of gum are determined by the existent gum (ASTM D-381, IP 131)
and potential gum (ASTM D-873, IP 138) test methods. Elemental analysis
of the gum can then provide its composition, with some indication of the
elements (other than carbon and hydrogen) that played a predominant role
in its formation.
Being the third most common element (after carbon and hydrogen) 
in petroleum product, sulfur has been analyzed extensively. Analytical
methods range from elemental analyses to functional group (sulfur type)
analyses to structural characterization to molecular speciation (Speight,
2001). Of the methods speciﬁed for the determination of sulfur (Speight,
2001), the method applied to the corrosion effect of sulfur in extremely
important for liquid fuels. In this method (ASTM D-1266, IP 154), fuel
corrosivity is assessed by the action of the fuel on a copper strip ( the copper
strip test ), which helps determine any discoloration of the copper due to
the presence of corrosive compounds. The copper strip is immersed in the
fuel and heated at 100°C (212°F) for 2 h in a bomb. A test using silver as
the test metal (IP 227) has also been published. Mercaptans are usually
the corrosive sulfur compounds of reference, and metal discoloration is
due to formation of the metal sulﬁde. Thus mercaptan sulfur is an impor-
tant property of potential fuels. In addition to the copper strip test, the
mercaptan sulfur (R-SH) content (ASTM D-1219, IP 104) provides valu-
able information. As an alternative to determining the mercaptan content,
a negative result in the Doctor test (ASTM D-484, IP 30) may also be
acceptable for the qualitative absence of mercaptans. The copper strip
method (ASTM D-130, ASTM D-849, ASTM D-4048, IP 154) may also be
used to determine the presence of corrosive sulfur compounds in residual
fuel oil.
The determination of sulfur in liquid products by X-ray ﬂuorescence
(ASTM D-2622, IP 336) has become an extremely well used method over
the past two decades. This method can be used to determine the amount of
sulfur in homogeneous liquid petroleum hydrocarbons over the range of
0.1–6.0% by weight. Samples with a sulfur content above this range may be
determined after dilution in toluene. The method utilizes the principle that
when a sample is irradiated with a Fe55source, ﬂuorescent X rays result.
The sulfur K aﬂuorescence and a background correction at adjacent wave-
lengths are counted. A calibration of the instrument, wherein the integra-
tion time for counting is adjusted such that the displayed signal for the
background-corrected radiation equals the concentration of the calibration
standard, gives a direct readout of the weight percent sulfur in the sample.
Interfering elements include aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, chlorine, argon,
and potassium. Generally the amounts of these elements are insufﬁcient to
affect sulfur X ray counts in samples covered by this method. Atmospheric
argon is eliminated by a helium purge.test methods 233It is also possible to determine nitrogen and sulfur simultaneously by
chemiluminescence and ﬂuorescence. An aliquot of the sample undergoes
high-temperature oxidation in a combustion tube maintained at 1050°C
(1920°F). Oxidation of the sample converts the chemically bound nitrogen
to nitric oxide (NO) and sulfur to sulfur dioxide (SO 2). In the nitrogen
detector, ozone reacts with the nitric oxide to form excited nitrogen dioxide
(NO 2). As the nitrogen dioxide reverts to its ground state, chemilumines-
cence occurs, and this light emission is monitored by a photomultiplier tube.
The light emitted is proportional to the amount of nitrogen in the sample.
In the sulfur detector, the sulfur dioxide is exposed to ultraviolet radiation
and produces a ﬂuorescent emission. This light emission is proportional to
the amount of sulfur and is also measured by a photomultiplier tube. Quan-
titation is determined by a comparison to the responses given by standards
containing carbazole and dimethyl sulfoxide in xylene.
Oxidative microcoulometry has become a widely accepted technique for"
"the determination of low concentrations of sulfur in petroleum and petro-
leum products (ASTM D-3120). The method involves combustion of the
sample in an oxygen-rich atmosphere followed by microcoulometric gen-
eration of tri-iodide ion to consume the resultant sulfur dioxide. This dis-
tinguishes the technique from reductive microcoulometry, which converts
sulfur in the sample to hydrogen sulﬁde that is titrated with coulometrically
generated silver ion.
Although sodium azide is included in the electrolyte of the microcoulo-
metric titration to minimize halogen and nitrogen interferences, the method
is not applicable when chlorine is present in excess of 10 times the sulfur
level or the nitrogen content exceeds 10% by weight. Heavy metals in
excess of 500 mg/kg also interfere with this method.
10.3.8. Flash Point
As for all petroleum products, considerations of safety in storage and trans-
portation and, more particularly, contamination by more volatile products
are required. This is usually accommodated by the Pensky–Martens ﬂash
point test (ASTM D-93, IP 34). For the fuel oil, a minimum ﬂash point of
55°C (131°F) or 66°C (150°F) is included in most speciﬁcations.
10.3.9. Metals Content
Heteroatoms (nitrogen ,oxygen ,sulfur , and metals ) are found in every
crude oil, and the concentrations must be reduced to convert the oil to
transportation fuel. The reason is that if nitrogen and sulfur are present
in the ﬁnal fuel during combustion, nitrogen oxides (NO x) and sulfur
oxides (SO x) form, respectively. In addition, metals affect the use of 234 residual fuel oilresidual fuel oil through adverse effects such as by causing corrosion or
by deposition.
The nature of the process by which residual fuel oil is produced virtu-
ally dictates that all the metals in the original crude oil can occur in the
residuum (Speight, 2001) and, thus, in the residual fuel. Metallic constituents
that may actually volatilize under the distillation conditions and appear in
the higher-boiling distillates are the exceptions and can appear in distillate
fuel oil.
The analysis for metal constituents in residua can be accomplished by
several instrumental techniques: inductively coupled argon plasma (ICAP)
spectrometry, atomic absorption (AA) spectrometry, and X-ray ﬂuores-
cence (XRF) spectrometry. Each technique has limitations in terms of
sample preparation, sensitivity, sampling, time for analysis, and overall ease
of use. Thus a number of tests (ASTM D-482, D-1026, D-1262, D-1318, D-
1368, D-1548, D-1549, D-2547 D-2599, D-2788, D-3340, D-3341, and D-
3605) have been designated to determine metals in petroleum products,
either directly or as the constituents of combustion ash, based on a variety
of techniques. At the time of this writing, the speciﬁc test for the determi-
nation of metals in whole feeds has not been designated. However, this task
can be accomplished by combustion of the sample so that only inorganic
ash remains (ASTM D-482). The ash can then be digested with an acid and
the solution can be examined for metal species by atomic absorption (AA)
spectroscopy (IP 288, IP 285) or by inductively coupled argon plasma spec-
trometry (ASTM C-1109, ASTM C-1111).
Atomic absorption provides very high sensitivity but requires careful
subsampling, extensive sample preparation, and detailed sample-matrix
corrections. X-ray ﬂuorescence requires little in terms of sample prepara-
tion but suffers from low sensitivity and the application of major matrix
corrections. Inductively coupled argon plasma spectrometry provides high
sensitivity and few matrix corrections but requires a considerable amount
of sample preparation depending on the process stream to be analyzed.
In the inductively coupled argon plasma emission spectrometer method,
nickel, iron, and vanadium content of gas oil samples in the range from
0.1 to 100 mg/kg. Thus a 10-g sample of gas oil is charred with sulfuric acid
and subsequently combusted to leave the ash residue. The resulting sul-
fates are then converted to their corresponding chloride salts to ensure
complete solubility. A barium internal standard is added to the sample
before analysis. In addition, the use of the ICAP method for the analysis
of nickel, vanadium, and iron present counteracts the two basic issues
arising from metals analysis. The most serious issue is the fact that these
metals are partly or totally in the form of volatile, chemically stable por-
phyrin complexes and extreme conditions are needed to destroy the com-
plexes without losing the metal through volatilization of the complex. Thetest methods 235second issue is that the alternate direct aspiration of the sample introduces
large quantities of carbon into the plasma. This carbon causes marked and
somewhat variable background changes in all direct measurement 
techniques.
Finally, the analytical method should be selected depending on the sen-
sitivity required, the compatibility of the sample matrix with the speciﬁc"
"analysis technique, and the availability of facilities. Sample preparation, if
it is required, can present problems. Signiﬁcant losses can occur, especially
in the case of organometallic complexes, and contamination of environ-
mental sample is of serious concern. The precision of the analysis depends
on the metal itself, the method used, and the standard used for calibration
of the instrument.
10.3.10. Molecular Weight
Molecular weight is a physical property that can be used in conjunction with
other physical properties to characterize residual fuel oil. Because residual
fuel oil is a mixture having a broad boiling range, measurement of mole-
cular weight provides the mass-average molecular weight or the number-
average molecular weight.
Molecular weight may be calculated from viscosity data (ASTM D-
2502) by using centistoke viscosity at 38°C (100°F) and 99°C (210°F). The
method is generally applicable to sample having a molecular weight in the
range of 250 to 700. Samples with unusual composition, such as aromatic-
free white mineral oils, or oils with very narrow boiling range, may give
atypical results.
For samples with higher molecular weight (up to 3000 or more) and
unusual composition or for polymers, another method (ASTM D-2503) is
recommended. This method uses a vapor pressure osmometer to determine
molecular weight. Low-boiling samples may not be suitable if their vapor
pressure interferes with the method.
Another method (ASTM D-2878) provides a procedure to calculate
these properties from test data on evaporation. In the method, the sample
is dissolved in an appropriate solvent. A drop each of this solution and the
solvent are suspended on separate thermistors in a closed chamber satu-
rated with solvent vapor. The solvent condenses on the sample drop and
causes a temperature difference between the two drops. The resultant
change in temperature is measured and used to determine the molecular
weight of the sample by reference to a previously prepared calibration
curve. This procedure is based on an older method (ASTM D-972) in which
the sample can be partly evaporated at a temperature of 250–500°C
(482–932°F), and ﬂuids not stable in this temperature range may require
special treatment.236 residual fuel oil10.3.11. Pour Point
The pour point (ASTM D-97, ASTM D-5949, ASTM D-5950, ASTM D-
5853, ASTM D-5985, IP 15) is the lowest temperature at which oil will ﬂow
under prescribed conditions. The test method for determining the solidiﬁ-
cation point (ASTM D-1493) might also be applied to residual fuel oil.
One of the main attributes of liquid fuels is the relative ease with which
they can be transferred from one place to another, but it is still necessary
to have some indication of the lowest temperature at which this may be
achieved. Depending on the storage conditions and the application of the
fuel, limits are placed on the pour point. Storage of the higher-viscosity fuel
oils in heated tankage will permit of higher pour points than would other-
wise be possible. Although the failure to ﬂow can generally be attributed
to the separation of wax from the fuel, it can also, in the case of very viscous
fuels, be due to the effect of viscosity.
The pour point of residual fuel oil may be inﬂuenced by the previous
thermal history of the residual fuel oil and the fact that any loosely knit
wax structure built up on cooling the fuel can, generally, be readily broken
up by the application of a little pressure, thus allowing fuels to be pumped
at temperatures below their pour point temperatures. The usefulness of the
pour point test in relation to residual fuel oils is, therefore, open to ques-
tion, and the tendency to regard it as the limiting temperature at which a
fuel will ﬂow can be misleading unless it is correlated with low-tempera-
ture viscosity.
The pour point test is still included in many speciﬁcations but not in some
(ASTM D-396, BS 2869) for assessing the pumpability characteristics of
residual fuel oil (ASTM D-3245). Pour point procedures involving various
preheat treatments before the pour point determination and the use of vis-
cosity at low temperatures have been proposed. The ﬂuidity test (ASTM
D-l659) is one such procedure as is the pumping temperature test (ASTM
D-3829); another test, based on viscosity measurements (IP 230), is also
available.
10.3.12. Refractive Index
The refractive index is the ratio of the velocity of light in air to the velocity of
light in the measured substance. The value of the refractive index varies
inversely with the wavelength of light used and the temperature at which the
measurements are taken. The refractive index is a fundamental physical
property that can be used for the determination of the gross composition of
residual fuel oil and often requires its measurement at elevated temperature.
In addition, the refractive index of a substance is related to its chemical"
"composition and may be used to draw conclusions about molecular structure.test methods 237Two methods (ASTM D-1218, ASTM D-1747) are available for meas-
uring the refractive index of viscous liquids. Both methods are limited to
lighter-colored samples for best accuracy.The latter test method (ASTM D-
1747) covers the measurement of refractive indexes of light-colored resid-
ual fuel oil at temperatures from 80 to 100°C (176–212°F). Temperatures
lower than 80°C (176°F) may be used provided that the melting point of
the sample is at least 10°C (18°F) below the test temperature. This test
method is not applicable, within reasonable standards of accuracy, to liquids
having darker residual fuel oil (having a color darker than ASTM Color
No. 4; ASTM D-1500).
10.3.13. Stability
The problem of instability in residual fuel oil may manifest itself either as
waxy sludge deposited at the bottom of an unheated storage tank or as
fouling of preheaters on heating of the fuel to elevated temperatures.
Problems of thermal stability and incompatibility in residual fuel oils are
associated with those fuels used in oil-ﬁred marine vessels, where the fuel
is usually passed through a preheater before being fed to the burner system.
In earlier days this preheating, with some fuels, could result in the deposi-
tion of asphaltic matter culminating, in the extreme case, in blockage of pre-
heaters and pipelines and even complete combustion failure.
Asphaltene-type deposition may, however, result from the mixing of
fuels of different origin and treatment, each of which may be perfectly sat-
isfactory when used alone. For example, straight-run fuel oils from the same
crude oil are normally stable and mutually compatible whereas fuel oils
produced from thermal cracking and visbreaking operations that may be
stable can be unstable or incompatible if blended with straight-run fuels
and vice versa (ASTM D-1661).
Another procedure for predicting the stability of residual fuel oil
involves the use of a spot test to show compatibility or cleanliness of the
blended fuel oil (ASTM D-2781, ASTM D-4740). The former method
(ASTM D-2781) covers two spot test procedures for rating a residual fuel
with respect to its compatibility with a speciﬁc distillate fuel. Procedure A
indicates the degree of asphaltene deposition that may be expected in
blending the components and is used when wax deposition is not consid-
ered a fuel application problem. Procedure B indicates the degree of wax
and asphalt deposition in the mixture at room temperature. The latter
method (ASTM D-4740) is applicable to fuel oils with viscosities up to 50
cSt at 100°C (212°F) to identify fuels or blends that could result in exces-
sive centrifuge loading, strainer plugging, tank sludge formation, or similar
operating problems. In the method, a drop of the preheated sample is put
on a test paper and placed in an oven at 100°C. After 1 h, the test paper is238 residual fuel oilremoved from the oven and the resultant spot is examined for evidence of
suspended solids and rated for cleanliness with the procedure described in
the method. In a parallel procedure for determining compatibility , a blend
composed of equal volumes of the fuel oil sample and the blend stock is
tested and rated in the same way as just described for the cleanliness
procedure.
For oxidative stability and the tendency to corrode metals, as may occur
in pipes and burners, a test method (ASTM D-4636) is available to deter-
mine resistance to oxidation and corrosion degradation and their tendency
to corrode various metals.The test method consists of one standard and two
alternative procedures. A particular speciﬁcation must establish which of
these tests should be used. A large glass tube containing an oil sample and
metal specimens is placed in a constant-temperature bath (usually from
100–360°C) and heated for the speciﬁed number of hours while air is passed
through the oil to provide agitation and a source of oxygen. Corrosiveness
of the oil is determined by the loss in metal mass and microscopic examina-
tion of the sample metal surface(s). Oil samples are withdrawn from the test
oil and checked for changes in viscosity and acid number as a result of the
oxidation reactions. At the end of the test the amount of the sludge present
in the oil remaining in the same tube is determined by centrifugation. Also,
the quantity of oil lost during the test is determined gravimetrically. Metals
used in the basic test and alternative test are aluminum, bronze, cadmium,
copper, magnesium, silver, steel, and titanium. Other metals may also be
speciﬁed as determined by the history and storage of the fuel oil.
10.3.14. Viscosity
Viscosity is an important property of residual fuel oils because it provides
information on the ease (or otherwise) with which a fuel can be transferred,
under the prevailing temperature and pressure conditions, from storage
tank to burner system. Viscosity data also indicate the degree to which a"
"fuel oil must be preheated to obtain the correct atomizing temperature for
efﬁcient combustion. Most residual fuel oils function best when the burner
input viscosity lies within a certain speciﬁed range.
The Saybolt Universal and Saybolt Furol viscometers are widely used in
the U.S. and the Engler viscometer in Europe. In the U.S., viscosities of the
lighter fuel grades are determined with the Saybolt Universal instrument
at 38°C (100°F); for the heaviest fuels the Saybolt Furol viscometer is used
at 50°C (122°F). Similarly, in Europe, the Engler viscometer is used at tem-
peratures of 20°C (68°F), 50°C (122°F), and in some instances 100°C
(212°F). The use of these empirical procedures for fuel oils is being super-
seded by the kinematic system (ASTM D-396, BS 2869) speciﬁcations for
fuel oils.test methods 239The determination of residual fuel oil viscosities is complicated by the
fact that some fuel oils containing signiﬁcant quantities of wax do not
behave as simple Newtonian liquids in which the rate of shear is directly
proportional to the shearing stress applied. At temperatures in the region
of 38°C (100°F) these fuels tend to deposit wax from solution, with a result-
ing adverse effect on the accuracy of the viscosity result unless the test tem-
perature is raised sufﬁciently high for all wax to remain in solution.
Although the present reference test temperature of 50°C (122°F) is ade-
quate for use with the majority of residual fuel oils, there is a growing trend
of opinion in favor of a higher temperature (82°C/180°F) particularly in
view of the availability of waxier fuel oils.
Anomalous viscosity in residual fuel oils is best shown by plotting the
kinematic viscosity determined at the normal test temperature and at two
or three higher temperatures on viscosity-temperature charts (ASTM D-
341). These charts are constructed so that, for a Newtonian fuel oil, the 
temperature-viscosity relationship is linear. Nonlinearity at the lower end
of the applicable temperature range is normally considered evidence of non-
Newtonian behavior. The charts are also useful for the estimation of the
viscosity of a fuel oil blend from knowledge of the component viscosities
and for calculation of the preheat temperature necessary to obtain the
required viscosity for efﬁcient atomization of the fuel oil in the burner.
Although it is considered a technical advantage to specify kinematic vis-
cosity, the conventional viscometers are still in wide use and it may be con-
venient, or even necessary, to be able to convert viscosities from one system
to another. Provision is made (ASTM D-2161) for the conversion of 
kinematic viscosity to Saybolt Universal and Furol viscosity and (in IP 
standards) for conversion to Redwood viscosity:

10.3.15. Volatility
Four distillation methods are in common use for determining the boiling
range and for collecting fractions from residual fuel oil. Such methods are
rarely used for characterization of the fuel oil but do warrant mention here
because of their application to fuel oil when desired.240 residual fuel oilOne method (ASTM D-1160) is probably the best known and most
widely used of the methods for distillation of higher-boiling petroleum
products and uses vacuum distillation. The method is applicable to samples
that can be at least partially volatilized at temperature up to 400°C (752°F)
and pressure in the range of 1–50 mmHg. The distillation temperature at
vacuum is converted to atmospheric equivalent temperatures.
Another method (ASTM D-447) is designed for characterization of
these narrow boiling fractions. Another method (ASTM D-2892) applies to
a wide range of products and uses a column with 15 theoretical plates and
a 5:1 reﬂux ratio. The distillation is started at atmospheric pressure until
the vapor temperature reaches 210°C (410°F). Distillation is continued at
vacuum (l00 mmHg) until the vapor temperature again reaches 210°C
(410°F) or cracking is observed.
With very heavy crude oil or viscous products, a preferred alternate dis-
tillation method (ASTM D-5236) should be used (instead of ASTM D-
2892) for heavy crude oil above a 400°C (752°F) cut point. In the spinning
band method (Fig. 10.3), fractions of feedstocks such as residual fuel oil with
an initial boiling point above room temperature at atmospheric pressure
can be investigated. For such materials, the initial boiling point of the
sample should exceed room temperature at atmospheric pressure. The dis-
tillation is terminated at an atmospheric equivalent temperature of 524°C
(975°F) and a pot temperature of 360°C (680°F)."
"In the method, samples are distilled under atmospheric and reduced
pressures in a still equipped with a spinning band column. Vapor tempera-
tures are converted to atmospheric equivalent temperatures and can be
plotted as a function of volume or weight percent distilled to yield a distil-
lation proﬁle. The spinning band, which effectively provides a large contact
area between the liquid phase and the vapor phase, increases the number
of theoretical plates in the column and thus its fractionating efﬁciency.
Readings of vapor temperature (which is convertible to atmospheric equiv-
alent temperature) and distillate volume (which is convertible to percent
by volume) are used to plot a distillation curve. Distillate yields for naphtha,
light gas oil, heavy gas oil, and residue fractions are determined on a gravi-
metric basis.
Another method, short path distillation , produces a single distillate and
a single residue fraction deﬁned by the operating temperature and pres-
sure of the still. This procedure is used to generate high-boiling-point frac-
tions with end points up to 700°C (1290°F) for further analysis. Because
only one cut temperature is used in each run, generation of a distillation
curve with this equipment would be time consuming. In the method, the
material to be fractionated is introduced at a constant rate onto the hot
inner wall of the evaporator under high vacuum. Rotating (Teﬂon) rollers
ensure that the ﬁlm on the wall is kept thin. The feedstock is progressivelytest methods 241distilled at the ﬁxed conditions of temperature and pressure. The distillate
vapors condense on a concentric cold surface (60°C/140°F) placed a short
distance from the hot wall inside the still. The condensate then drains by
gravity to the base of the cold ﬁnger , where it is collected. The residue
drains down the hot wall and is collected through a separate port.
However, unless a distillation method is required by speciﬁcation or the
collected fractions are needed for further testing, gas chromatographic
methods are now preferred for determining the boiling range of petroleum
fractions, and detailed information for samples with a ﬁnal boiling point no
higher than 538°C (1000°F) at atmospheric pressure and a boiling range
greater than 55°C (100°F) is available (ASTM D-2887).242 residual fuel oil
Figure 10.3. The spinning band equipment10.3.16. Water
Contamination in residual fuel oil may be indicated by the presence of
excessive amounts of water, emulsions, and inorganic material such as sand
and rust. Appreciable amounts of sediment in a residual fuel oil can foul
the handling facilities and give problems in burner mechanisms. Blockage
of fuel ﬁlters (ASTM D-2068, ASTM D-6426) due to the presence of fuel
degradation products may also result. This aspect of fuel quality control
may be dealt with by placing restrictions on the water (ASTM D-95, IP 74),
sediment by extraction (ASTM D-473, IP 53), or water and sediment
(ASTM D-96, IP 75) values obtained for the fuel.
In any form, water and sediment are highly undesirable in fuel oil ,and
the relevant tests involving distillation (ASTM D-95, ASTM D-4006, IP 74,
IP 358), centrifuging (ASTM D-96, ASTM D-4007), extraction (ASTM D-
473, IP 53), and the Karl Fischer titration (ASTM D-4377, ASTM D-4928,
IP 356, IP 386, IP 438, IP 439) are regarded as important in determination
of quality.
The Karl Fischer test method (ASTM D-1364,ASTM D-6304) covers the
direct determination of water in petroleum products. In the test, the sample
injection in the titration vessel can be performed on a volumetric or gravi-
metric basis. Viscous samples, such as residual fuel oil, can be analyzed with
a water vaporizer accessory that heats the sample in the evaporation
chamber, and the vaporized water is carried into the Karl Fischer titration
cell by a dry inert carrier gas.
Water and sediment can be determined simultaneously (ASTM D-96,
ASTM D-1796, ASTM D-4007, IP 75, IP 359) by the centrifuge method.
Known volumes of residual fuel oil and solvent are placed in a centrifuge
tube and heated to 60°C (140°F). After centrifugation, the volume of the
sediment and water layer at the bottom of the tube is read. In the unlikely
event that the residual fuel oil contains wax, a temperature of 71°C (160°F)
or higher may be required to completely melt the wax crystals so that they
are not measured as sediment.
Sediment is also determined by an extraction method (ASTM D-473, IP
53) or by membrane ﬁltration (ASTM D-4807). In the former method
(ASTM D-473, IP 53), a sample contained in a refractory thimble is
extracted with hot toluene until the residue reaches a constant mass. In the
latter test, the sample is dissolved in hot toluene and ﬁltered under vacuum
through a 0.45- mm-porosity membrane ﬁlter. The ﬁlter with residue is
washed, dried, and weighed.
In a test speciﬁcally designed for residual fuel oil (ASTM D-4870, IP
375), a 10-g sample of oil is ﬁltered through the prescribed apparatus at"
"100°C. After washing with the solvent and drying, the total sediment on the
ﬁlter medium is weighed. The test is to be carried out in duplicate.test methods 243REFERENCES

MINERAL OIL (WHITE OIL)
11.1. INTRODUCTION
In the present context, the term mineral oil or white oil refers to colorless
or very pale oils within the lubricating oil class as regards carbon number
and boiling range (Table 11.1, Fig. 11.1). Minerals (mineral) oils belong to
two main groups, medicinal (pharmaceutical) oils and technical oils, the
chief difference being degree of reﬁning (Gruse and Stevens, 1960; Guthrie,
1967; Biske, 1973; Weissermel and Arpe, 1978; Francis and Peters, 1980;
Hoffman, 1983; Austin, 1984; Chenier, 1992; Hoffman and McKetta, 1993;
Warne, 1998; Speight, 2000; Banaszewski and Blythe, 2000).
Medicinal oils represent the most reﬁned of the bulk petroleum pro-
ducts, especially when the principal use is for the pharmaceutical industry.
Thus mineral oil destined for pharmaceutical purposes must meet stringent
speciﬁcations to ensure that the oil is inert and that it does not contain any
materials that are suspected to be toxic. Technical mineral oil (as opposed
to pharmaceutical mineral oil) must meet much less stringent speciﬁcations
requirements because the use is generally for transformer oil, cosmetic
preparations (such as hair cream), in the plastics industry, and in textiles
processing. Many of the same test methods are applied to all mineral oils,
although the speciﬁcations will differ and oils for different uses will have
to meet different standards of purity.
Technical oils ﬁnd uses in different industries but in particular the elec-
trical industry, where there is frequent use of transformer oil. Transformer"
"oil can be divided into two main groups: (a) oils for transformers and switch
gear and (b) oils for power cables; this latter group can be further sub-
divided into thin oils, for use in oil-ﬁlled ( hollow core ) cables, and more
viscous oils, sometimes used as such in cable insulation but more commonly
as components of cable impregnation compounds.
11.2. PRODUCTION AND PROPERTIES
Mineral oils are produced from selected petroleum fractions that are dis-
tilled to provide ﬁnished products with the desired viscosity. In addition to
247viscosity, properties considered during feedstock selection include pour
point, cloud point, distillation range, smoke point, speciﬁc gravity, among
others.
Typically, mineral oil is distilled to speciﬁcation from the required crude
oil fraction followed by pretreatment by solvent extraction, hydrotreating,
and dewaxing (Gruse and Stevens, 1967; Speight, 2000 and references cited
therein). Application of hydrotreating (Speight, 2000) means that mineral
oil can be produced without acid treatment. However, on occasion, there is
still the need to exhaustively treat the selected feedstock with concentrated
sulfuric acid (gaseous sulfur trioxide treatment also may be used) to remove
the aromatic, unsaturated hydrocarbons and other impurities. Petroleum
sulfonic acids, produced as by-products during acid treatment, are removed
by extraction and neutralization. The oil can be reﬁned even further to an
ultimate degree of purity by adsorption.
The fraction chosen for reﬁning may have been subjected to a pre-
liminary reﬁning with a differential solvent. The exact procedure for the
acid treatment varies (Speight, 2000), but a preliminary acid treatment
(chieﬂy for drying) may be followed by incremental addition of as much
as 50% by volume of acid as strong as 20% fuming sulfuric acid. The
sludge is promptly removed to limit oxidation-reduction reactions; the
time, temperature, and method of application depend on the type of
charge stock and the desired degree of reﬁning. The product is neutral-
ized with alkali and washed with ethyl or isopropyl alcohol or acetone
to remove the oil-soluble sulfonic mahogany acids ; water-soluble green248 mineral oil (white oil)

with clay.
11.3. TEST METHODS
Many test methods are available to determine whether the quality pre-
scribed by consumers for mineral oils is present. In all cases, tests that are
carried out for lower-molecular-weight products and for higher-molecular-
weight products are of lesser consequence with mineral oil. The stringent
methods of reﬁning (puriﬁcation) remove many of the impurities, of whichtest methods 249
Figure 11.1. Boiling point and carbon number for various hydrocarbons and petroleum productsash-forming constituents can be cited as one example, making the test for
such constituents redundant. If, for some reason, ash-forming constituents
are believed to be present in the mineral oil, the test methods for ash (the
presence of ash-forming constituents) that are applied to distillate fuel oil
and top residual fuel oil can be applied to mineral oil.
But ﬁrst, although the importance of careful sampling of any product
that is to undergo testing is self-evident, very special precautions must be
taken in the case of insulating oils (ASTM D-923, IP 51), for which special
techniques are recommended. Precautions that are stipulated are mainly
concerned with the avoidance of contamination that would affect electrical
tests.
The main requirement of a transformer oil is that it should act as a heat
transfer medium to ensure that the operating temperature of a transformer
does not exceed acceptable limits. However, the deterioration of trans-
former oils in service is closely connected with oxidation by air, which
brings on deposition of sludge and the development of acids, resulting in
overheating and corrosion, respectively (ASTM D-4310). The sludge
formed is usually attributed to the direct oxidation of the hydrocarbon con-
stituents to oil-insoluble products.
Mineral oils used as insecticides require measurement of molecular
weight (ASTM D-2502, ASTM D-2503, ASTM D-2878) and composition"
"because the structure of the constituents appears to be a factor in deter-
mining the insecticide power of these oils. Oleﬁns and aromatics are both
highly toxic to insects, but they also have a detrimental effect on plants; thus
spray oils generally receive some degree of reﬁning, especially those of the
summer oil type that come into contact with foliage.
11.3.1. Acidity or Alkalinity
The acid number —the quantity of base, expressed in milligrams of potas-
sium hydroxide per gram of sample, that is required to titrate a sample in
this solvent to a green/green-brown end point with p-naphtholbenzein indi-
cator solution (ASTM D-974, IP 139). However, many higher-molecular-
weight oil products (dark-colored oils), which cannot be analyzed for
acidity because of  obscurity of the color-indicator end point, can be ana-
lyzed by an alternate test method (ASTM D-664). The quality of the
mineral oil products renders them suitable for determination of the acid
number.
The principle behind the acid number test is a holdover from earlier
reﬁning processes when it was believed, with some justiﬁcation, that
detectable amounts of chemicals that were used in reﬁning could remain in
the ﬁnished product (ASTM D-974, ASTM D-1093, IP 139). However, oxi-
dation (ASTM D-943, ASTM D-3339, ASTM D-5770, IP 431) of various250 mineral oil (white oil)oils during use or during storage can induce the formation of acidic species
within the oil. Thus the occurrence of acidic entities within the oil is still a
concern even though the reason may be different.
To determine the acid number (ASTM D-974), the sample is dissolved
in a mixture of toluene and isopropyl alcohol containing a small amount of
water, and the resulting single-phase solution is titrated at room tempera-
ture with standard alcoholic base or alcoholic acid solution to the end point
indicated by the color change of the added p-naphtholbenzein solution
(orange in acid and green-brown in base). To determine the strong acid
number, a separate portion of the sample is extracted with hot water and
the aqueous extract is titrated with potassium hydroxide solution, with
methyl orange as an indicator.
The total absence of organic acidity is never feasible, but a very low limit
must be set if corrosion of copper (ASTM D-130, ASTM D-849, ASTM D-
4048, ASTM D-4636, IP 154) and other components is to be avoided;
moreover, more than a trace of some organic acids can adversely affect 
the response of the oil to amine inhibitors.
Similarly to the principle of acidic constituents, oil may, on occasion,
contain alkaline or basic constituents. The presence of such constituents is
determined through test methods for the base number. The relative
amounts of these materials can be determined by titrating with acids.
Thus, in a manner akin to the acid number , the base number (often
referred to as the neutralization number ) is a measure of the basic con-
stituents in the oil under the conditions of the test. The base number is used
as a guide in the quality control of oil formulation and is also used as a
measure of oil degradation in service.
There are four different test methods for the determination of base
numbers (ASTM D-664, ASTM D-974, ASTM D-2896, ASTM D-4739).
However, the different base number methods may give different results for
the same sample.
If the mineral oil contains additives that react with alkali to form metal
soaps, the saponiﬁcation number (ASTM D-94, IP 136) expresses the
amount of base that will react with 1 g of the sample when heated in a spe-
ciﬁc manner. Because compounds of sulfur, phosphorus, halogens, and
certain other elements, which are sometimes added to petroleum products,
also consume alkali and acids, the results obtained indicate the effect of
these extraneous materials in addition to the saponiﬁable material present.
In the test method, a known weight of the sample is dissolved in methyl
ethyl ketone or a mixture of suitable solvents. It is heated with a known
amount of standard alcoholic potassium hydroxide for between 30 and 
90 min at 80°C (176°F). At the end of the reaction, the excess alkali is
titrated with standard hydrochloric acid and the saponiﬁcation number is
calculated.test methods 25111.3.2. Aniline Point
The aniline point or mixed aniline point (ASTM D-611, IP 2) gives an indi-
cation of the hydrocarbon group composition of an oil. The lower the
aniline point, the more aromatic the oil, and, for any particular compound
type, the aniline point rises with molecular weight and with viscosity.
In the test, equal volumes of aniline and oil are mixed and heated until
a miscible mixture is formed. During cooling at a prescribed rate, the tem-
perature at which the mixture becomes cloudy is recorded and identiﬁed
as the aniline point. Although not usually applicable to pharmaceutical
grade mineral oils, the test is used in technical oil speciﬁcations as a measure
of degree of reﬁnement and type of base oil stock. For any particular oil"
"fraction. a higher degree of reﬁnement is reﬂected by an increase in aniline
point.Aniline point also increases with the average molecular weight of the
oil as well as with increasing proportions of parafﬁnic hydrocarbons to
naphthenic hydrocarbons. Aniline point speciﬁcations also can be used to
advantage for light technical grade mineral oils used in agricultural sprays,
where the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons might cause ﬂoral damage.
For electrical oils the aniline point is often an indicator of the aromatic
content because too high a value could give rise to oxidation instability and
too low a value to inadequate gassing characteristics under electric stress.
For these reasons an aniline point, usually in the form of a range of 
permitted values, is sometimes included in speciﬁcations. An increase in 
the aniline point after extraction with sulfuric acid is perhaps a better indi-
cation of aromatic content than the aniline point of the untreated sample.
The test for aniline point (ASTM D-611, IP 2) is not usually applied to
medicinal oils, but some users of technical grades specify a minimum value.
For oils of similar purity and viscosity a high aniline point denotes a more
parafﬁnic, and hence less dense, oil than a lower aniline point; the desire
for a high aniline point runs counter to the view that the higher the density
the more preferable the oil if it is desired to make emulsions (e.g., hair
cream) therefrom. Generally, the higher the aniline point the greater the
stability of the oil but, on the other hand, a high aniline point sample may
only indicate more extensive reﬁning if comparisons are made on fractions
of the same boiling range from the same crude oil. In addition, variations
in aniline point may reﬂect changes in depth of reﬁning as well as differ-
ences in hydrocarbon group composition for oils of same the viscosity but
different origins.
11.3.3. Asphaltene Content (Insoluble Constituents)
The asphaltene fraction (ASTM D-893, ASTM D-2006, ASTM D-2007,
ASTM D-3279, ASTM D-4124, ASTM D-6560, IP 143) is the highest-252 mineral oil (white oil)molecular-weight. most complex fraction in petroleum. Insofar as the
asphaltene content gives an indication of the amount of coke that can be
expected during exposure to thermal conditions (Speight, 2001; Speight and
Ozum 2002), there is little need for the application of the test to mineral
oil.Thus determination of the asphaltene content of mineral oil may be con-
sidered superﬂuous, but there may be an occasion when there is the need
to determine the amount of insoluble constituents precipitated by the addi-
tion of a low-boiling hydrocarbon liquid to mineral oil.
In any of the methods for the determination of the asphaltene content,
a sample is mixed with a large excess (usually >30 volumes hydrocarbon
per volume of sample) of low-boiling hydrocarbon such as n-pentane or n-
heptane (Speight et al., 1984). For an extremely viscous sample, a solvent
such as toluene may be used before the addition of the low-boiling hydro-
carbon but an additional amount of the hydrocarbon (usually >30 volumes
hydrocarbon per volume of solvent) must be added to compensate for the
presence of the solvent. After a speciﬁed time, the insoluble material (the
asphaltene fraction) is separated (by ﬁltration) and dried. The yield is
reported as percentage (% w/w) of the original sample.
Another method is designed to remove pentane-insoluble constituents
by membrane ﬁltration (ASTM D-4055). In this method, a sample of oil is
mixed with pentane in a volumetric ﬂask, and the oil solution is ﬁltered
through a 0.8- mm membrane ﬁlter. The ﬂask, funnel, and ﬁlter are washed
with pentane to completely transfer any particulates onto the ﬁlter, after
which the ﬁlter (with particulates) is dried and weighed to give the pentane-
insoluble constituents as a percentage by weight of the sample.
The precipitation number is often equated to the asphaltene content, but
there are several issues that remain obvious in its rejection for this purpose.
For example, the method to determine the precipitation number (ASTM
D-91) advocates the use of naphtha for use with black oil or lubricating oil
and the amount of insoluble material (as a % v/v of the sample) is the pre-
cipitating number. In the test, 10 ml of sample is mixed with 90 ml of ASTM
precipitation naphtha (which may or may nor have a constant chemical
composition) in a graduated centrifuge cone and centrifuged for 10 min at
600–700rpm. The volume of material on the bottom of the centrifuge cone
is noted until repeat centrifugation gives a value within 0.1ml (the pre-
cipitation number). Obviously, this can be substantially different from the
asphaltene content.
11.3.4. Carbonizable Substances (Acid Test)
Medicinal oil requires a test in which the reaction of the oil to hot, strong
sulfuric acid is used to determine the presence of carbonizable substance"
"in the oil. However, the test for carbonizable substances (ASTM D-565)test methods 253should not be confused with the test methods for determining carbon
residue (ASTM D-189, ASTM D-524, ASTM D4530, IP 13, IP 14, IP 398).
In the test method (ASTM D-565), the mineral oil is treated with con-
centrated sulfuric acid under prescribed conditions and the resulting color
is compared with a reference standard to determine whether it passes or
fails the test. When the oil layer shows no change in color and when the
acid layer is not darker than the reference standard colorimetric solution,
the oil is reported as passing the test.A bluish haze or a slight pink or yellow
color in the oil layer should not be interpreted as a change in color. This is
a pass-fail, and the more fully reﬁned the oil, the lighter the color of the
acid layer.
With the introduction of ultraviolet absorption procedures (ASTM D-
2008, ASTM D-2269), the test ﬁnds less use but still provides a useful
method to determine possible contamination of mineral oil with impurities
transparent to both visible and ultraviolet light and hence not detectable
by color or by ultraviolet absorption measurements.
For technical mineral oils the test for unsulfonatable residue (ASTM D-
483) may be applied, but the test is of less signiﬁcance for mineral oil that
is reﬁned to medicinal standard. The other quality criteria are much more
stringent, and the test method for unsulfonatable residue does not have the
required sensitivity.
11.3.5. Carbon Residue
Mineral oils are usually considered to have a high propensity for carbon
formation and deposition under thermal conditions. Nevertheless, the tests
that are applied to determine the carbon-forming propensity of fuel oil (and
other petroleum products) are also available for application to mineral oils.
The test methods for the carbon residue should not be confused with the
test method for carbonizable substances (ASTM D-565). The former test
methods are thermal in nature, whereas the latter test method involves the
use of sulfuric acid in a search for speciﬁc chemical entities within the oil.
Thus the tests for Conradson carbon residue (ASTM D-189, IP 13), the
Ramsbottom carbon residue (ASTM D-524, IP 14), the microcarbon carbon
residue (ASTM D4530, IP 398), and asphaltene content (ASTM D-893,
ASTM D-2006, ASTM D-2007, ASTM D-3279, ASTM D-4124, ASTM D-
6560, IP 143) are often included in inspection data for fuel oil.
In the Conradson carbon residue test (ASTM D-189, IP 13), a weighed
quantity of sample is placed in a crucible and subjected to destructive dis-
tillation for a ﬁxed period of severe heating. At the end of the speciﬁed
heating period, the test crucible containing the carbonaceous residue is
cooled in a desiccator and weighed and the residue is reported as a per-
centage (% w/w) of the original sample (Conradson carbon residue). In the254 mineral oil (white oil)Ramsbottom carbon residue test (ASTM D-524, IP 14), the sample is
weighed into a glass bulb that has a capillary opening and is placed into a
furnace (at 550°C/1022°F).The volatile matter is distilled from the bulb, and
the nonvolatile matter that remains in the bulb cracks to form thermal coke.
After a speciﬁed heating period, the bulb is removed from the bath, cooled
in a desiccator, and weighed to report the residue (Ramsbottom carbon
residue) as a percentage (% w/w) of the original sample. In the micro-
carbon residue test (ASTM D4530, IP 398), a weighed quantity of the sample
placed in a glass vial is heated to 500°C (932°F) under an inert (nitrogen)
atmosphere in a controlled manner for a speciﬁc time and the carbonaceous
residue [ carbon residue (micro) ] is reported as a percentage (% w/w) of the
original sample.
The data produced by the microcarbon test (ASTM D-4530, IP 398) are
equivalent to those produced by the Conradson carbon method (ASTM D-
189, IP 13). However, this microcarbon test method offers better control of
test conditions and requires a smaller sample. Up to 12 samples can be run
simultaneously. This test method is applicable to petroleum and to petro-
leum products that partially decompose on distillation at atmospheric pres-
sure and is applicable to a variety of samples that generate a range of yields
(0.01% w/w to 30% w/w) of thermal coke.
The data give an indication of the amount of constituents that may be
undesirable in the oil, thereby requiring that the oil, depending on its 
designated use, be subjected to further reﬁning.
Finally, a method that is used to determine pitch volatility (ASTM D-
4893) might also be used, on occasion, to determine the nonvolatility of
mineral oil. In the method, an aluminum dish containing about 15 g of accu-
rately weighed sample is introduced into the cavity of a metal block heated
and maintained at 350°C (662°F). After 30 min, during which the volatiles
are swept away from the surface of the sample by preheated nitrogen, the"
"residual sample is taken out and allowed to cool down in the desiccator.
Nonvolatility is determined by the sample weight remaining and reported
as % w/w residue.
11.3.6. Cloud Point
The cloud point is the temperature at which a cloud of wax crystal ﬁrst
appears in a liquid when it is cooled under conditions prescribed in the test
method. This test method covers only petroleum oils that are transparent
in layers 38mm (1.5 in.) in thickness, and have a cloud point below 49°C
(120°F). The cloud point is an indicator of the lowest temperature of the
utility of an oil for certain applications, and it is usually higher than the pour
point (ASTM D-97, ASTM D-5853, ASTM D-5949, ASTM D-5950, ASTM
D-5985, IP 15).test methods 255The cloud point (ASTM D-2500, ASTM D-5771, ASTM D-5772, ASTM
D-5773, IP 219) is the temperature at which wax appears in an oil. This
information is signiﬁcant for oils to be used at low temperatures, where 
precipitation of wax might affect the performance of the oil.
In one of the tests (ASTM D-2500, IP 219), the oil is maintained at 0°C
(32°F) for 4 h, when a 0.5-mm black line must be easily seen through an oil
layer 25 mm thick. The setting of a value as low as this is dictated largely
by considerations of appearance of the oil; a much higher temperature
could well be tolerated if only practical considerations applied. Moreover
the n-parafﬁns that are responsible for cloudiness (hence the need to
observe that the opalescence is not due to moisture) are among the more
inert of the hydrocarbon groups of which these mineral oils are composed.
The later test methods (ASTM D-5771, ASTM D-5772, ASTM D-5773)
are alternative procedures that use automatic apparatus. However, when
the speciﬁcations state that the original method (ASTM D-2500, IP 219)
should be used, these later methods should not be applied without obtain-
ing comparative data ﬁrst. However, all three methods have a higher degree
of precision than the original method.
Neither the cloud point nor the pour point should be confused or inter-
changed with the freezing point (ASTM D 2386, ASTM D-5901, ASTM D-
5972, IP 16, IP 434, IP 435). The freezing point presents an estimate of
minimum handling temperature and minimum line or storage temperature.
It is not a test for an indication of purity and has limited value for mineral
oil.
11.3.7. Color and Taste
By deﬁnition, pharmaceutical grade mineral oil must be colorless and trans-
parent. Although the eye can determine color, it is usual to determine color
by instrument.
The colorless character of these oils is important in some cases, because
it may indicate the chemically inert nature of the hydrocarbon constituents.
Textile lubricants should be colorless to prevent staining of light-colored
threads and fabrics. Insecticide oils should be free of reactive (easily oxi-
dized) constituents so as not to injure plant tissues when applied as sprays
(ASTM D-483).
The main use of mineral oil in medicine has been as a laxative (an ali-
mentary tract lubricant) and in various pharmaceutical preparations such
as ointments, and, as such use continues, this quality of oil is ﬁnding increas-
ing utilization as a lubricant for food processing machinery and in plastics
manufacture. Laxative oils should be free of odor and taste and also be free
of hydrocarbons that may react during storage and produce unwanted 
by-products. These properties are attained by the removal of oxygen-,256 mineral oil (white oil)nitrogen-, and sulfur-containing compounds, as well as reactive hydrocar-
bons by, for example, sulfuric acid.The maximum permissible quantity of such
oil traces is prescribed, but also the purity of the oil (ASTM D-2269) requires
that the absorbance be measured on a dimethyl sulfoxide extract of the oil.
Determination of the color of mineral oil is used mainly for manufac-
turing control purposes and is an important quality characteristic. In some
cases the color may serve as an indication of the degree of reﬁnement of
the material. However, color is not always a reliable guide to product
quality and should not be used indiscriminately in product speciﬁcations
(ASTM D-156, ASTM D-1209, ASTM D-1500, ASTM D-1544, ASTM D-
6045, IP 17).
In one test (ASTM D-156) for the determination of color the height of
a column of the oil is decreased by levels corresponding to color numbers
until the color of the sample is lighter than that of the standard. The color
number immediately above this level is recorded as the Saybolt color of the
oil, and a color number of +25 corresponds to water mineral, whereas the
minimum color intensity reading on this scale is expressed by +30, a value
normally attained by mineral oils. In another test (IP 17), in which the mea-
surements are performed with an 18-in. cell against color slides on a scale,
a color of 1.0 or under is considered water-mineral and medicinal oils will
normally be 0.5 or less. Conversion scales for different color tests are avail-
able (ASTM D-1500)."
"Although sometimes found in insulating oil speciﬁcations, the color 
characteristic is of no technical signiﬁcance. Pale oils are, as a general rule,
more severely reﬁned than dark oils of the same viscosity, and color (ASTM
D-1500, IP 17) is not a guide to stability. Deterioration of color after 
submission of the oil to an aging test is sometimes limited, but here again
extent of oil deterioration can be much better measured by some other
property such as acidity development or change in electrical conductivity
(ASTM D-2624, ASTM D-4308, IP 274). About the only point that can be
made in favor of color measurement on new oil is that it can give an 
immediate guide to a change in supply continuity.
11.3.8. Composition
The potential for the presence in mineral oil of trace amounts of carcino-
genic polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons cannot be overestimated. Thus
compositional tests focus on the production of data relating to the presence
of aromatic and polynuclear aromatic constituents in mineral oil.
As a result, a test method (ASTM D-2269) that can be applied to the
ultraviolet absorbance of mineral oil is available. The investigation can 
be performed either directly on the oil itself (or on oil diluted with inert
solvent) or else on a solvent extract of the oil, the solvent chosen (e.g.,test methods 257dimethyl sulfoxide) being one that will extract and concentrate the polynu-
clear aromatics.
Although informative, there have also been extensive efforts to corre-
late composition with physical properties. Among the most deﬁnitive of
these efforts was the refractive index-density-molecular weight (n-d-M)
method (ASTM D-3238). Carbon type composition gives the breakdown of
total carbon atoms between various structures. Following from this, another
method (ASTM D-2140, derived from n-d-M analysis (ASTM D-3238),
involves the measurement of refractive index, density, and viscosity, for all
of which standard procedures are available. From the data, it is possible to
determine the distribution of carbon types (parafﬁn chains, naphthenic
rings, and aromatic rings) in the oil. However, it is important to recognize
that the percent aromatic carbon determined by this method does not cor-
respond to aromatics as determined by other procedures (e.g., adsorption
chromatography). For example, octadecylbenzene (C 6H5C18H37) has only
has 25% of the carbon as aromatic carbon (C A) but chromatographic 
separation would show this compound to be separated as an aromatic 
compound.
Aniline point (ASTM D-611, IP 2) gives an indication of the hydro-
carbon group composition of oil. The aniline point rises with molecular
weight; also, for a given viscosity, the higher the aniline point the more
parafﬁnic the oil. For electrical oils it is sometimes desirable to control the
aromatic content because too high a value could give rise to oxidation insta-
bility and too low a value to inadequate gassing characteristics under elec-
tric stress. For these reasons an aniline point, usually in the form of a range
of permitted values, is sometimes included in speciﬁcations. And a rise in
the aniline point after extraction with sulfuric acid is perhaps a better indi-
cation of aromatic content than aniline point on the untreated sample.
A technique for applying infrared measurements to insulating oil is avail-
able (ASTM D-2144), and considerable information about mineral oil com-
position can be gained from infrared spectroscopy. Oxygenated bodies
formed when oil deteriorates can be recognized, and hence this procedure
can be used for surveillance of oils in service.An infrared spectrum can also
give information as to the aromaticity of an oil and can detect antioxidants
such as 2,6 di-tertiary butyl p-cresol. A chemical test for the latter is,
however, available and is preferable for quantitative purposes (ASTM 
D-1473).
Although the total sulfur content (ASTM D-129, IP 61) of medicinal oil
is not limited as such, it is in effect restricted (usually to well below 100
ppm) by the necessity of severe reﬁning to meet the other clauses of the
speciﬁcation. However, the total sulfur content of mineral oils normally is
well below 100 ppm because of the severe reﬁning to which the oil has been
subjected (Speight, 2000). Therefore, sulfur is not a limiting factor in the258 mineral oil (white oil)speciﬁcations of mineral oil. Nevertheless, test methods are available to
determine the presence of sulfur compounds in mineral oil, although the
preferred procedure is often the Doctor test (ASTM D-4952, IP 30). For
medicinal oils the procedure is that two drops of a saturated solution of
lead monoxide in 20% aqueous sodium hydroxide are added to two
volumes of oil and one volume of absolute ethyl alcohol. The mixture is
heated to 70°C (158°F) for 10 min and should remain colorless.
Other test methods for the determination of corrosive sulfur (speciﬁ-
cally hydrogen sulﬁde) are also available (ASTM D-6021, ASTM D-5705),"
"which have been developed for residual fuel oil but can be applied to
medicinal oil. Another test method (ASTM D-3227, IP 324) is used for the
determination of mercaptan (R-SH) sulfur in petroleum products up to
and including distillate fuels. However, there is no reason that the test
could not be applied to mineral oil, with the use of any necessary modiﬁ-
cations for solubility of the mineral oil in the alcoholic solution used for
the titration.
In view of the wide use of copper in electrical equipment, it is essential
to ensure that the oil does not corrode this metal. Noncorrosive or corro-
sive sulfur can be veriﬁed by any one of several test methods (ASTM D-
130, ASTM D-849, ASTM D-4048, ASTM D-4636, IP 154) in which the oil
is heated in the presence of a metallic copper strip for a speciﬁed time at a
speciﬁed temperature after which the strip must be discolored. In addition,
corrosiveness toward silver is becoming increasingly important, and a test
method (IP 227) has been developed that is closely similar to the copper
corrosion test.
Molecular type analysis separates an oil into different molecular species.
A molecular type analysis is the so-called clay-gel analysis . In this method,
group separation is achieved by adsorption in a percolation column with
selected grades of clay and silica gel as the adsorption media (ASTM 
D-2007).
11.3.9. Density (Speciﬁc Gravity)
The use of density (speciﬁc gravity) data (ASTM D-1298, IP 160) for
mineral oil is variable, although, for some grades of mineral oil, a high
density can be indicative of the ultimate use of the oil.
For example, density or speciﬁc gravity data (ASTM D-1298, ASTM D-
1480, ASTM D-1481, ASTM D-4052, ASTM D-5002 IP 160) are frequently
included as a speciﬁcation requirement for transformer oil when trans-
formers operate in cold climates. Water, however undesirable in electrical
equipment, does collect therein, and if an oil has a high density, any
water/ice present would ﬂoat on the oil instead of remaining at the bottom
of the oil container, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the oil.test methods 259For heavier insulating oil, the purpose of limiting density range is to
provide a check on oil composition. In addition, a minimum density may
offer some indication of solvent power as well as guarding against exces-
sive parafﬁn content. In this respect, the inclusion of density in a mineral
oil speciﬁcation may duplicate the aniline point (ASTM D-611, IP 2)
requirement.
The API gravity (ASTM D-287) is a special function of speciﬁc gravity
that was arbitrarily established to permit use of a wider industrial range of
numbers and is derived from the speciﬁc gravity:
API gravity, deg =(141.5/sp gr 60/60°F) – 131.5
Density, speciﬁc gravity, and API gravity values permit conversion of
volumes at the measured temperature to volumes at the standard petro-
leum temperatures of 15°C (60°F). Calculation of weight is possible where
compositions are formulated on a weight basis. At a given viscosity, density,
speciﬁc gravity, and API gravity provide a means for determining whether
a mineral oil is derived from a parafﬁnic or a naphthenic feedstock.
11.3.10. Electrical Properties
Electrical properties of one form or another are included in virtually all
speciﬁcations for insulating oils.
The electric strength or dielectric breakdown test method (ASTM D-877)
indicates the absence, or presence, of free or suspended water and other
contaminant matter that will conduct electricity. A high electric strength
gives no indication of the purity of an oil in the sense of degree of reﬁne-
ment or the absence of most types of oil-soluble contaminants. This test
method is of some assistance, when applied to an otherwise satisfactory oil,
to indicate that the oil is free of contaminants of the type indicated above;
in practice, this ensures that the oil is dry.
The test for stability (gas evolution) under electric stress must not be
confused with tests for the gas content of insulating oil (ASTM D-831,
ASTM D-1827, ASTM D-2945). These tests are largely factory control tests
to ensure that oils intended for ﬁlling equipment have been adequately
degassed (because dissolved gas, like gas evolved under stress, could cause
void formation).
11.3.11. Flash Point and Fire Point
The ﬂash point (closed tester: ASTM D-93/IP 34; open tester: ASTM D-
92/IP 36) is the lowest temperature at atmospheric pressure (760mmHg,
101.3kPa) at which application of a test ﬂame will cause the vapor of a260 mineral oil (white oil)sample to ignite under speciﬁed test conditions. The sample is deemed to
have reached the ﬂash point when a large ﬂame appears and instanta-
neously propagates itself over the surface of the sample. Flash point data
are used in shipping and safety regulations to deﬁne ﬂammable and com-
bustible materials. Flash point data can also indicate the possible presence
of highly volatile and ﬂammable constituents in a relatively nonvolatile or"
"nonﬂammable material. The ﬁre point (ASTM D-92, IP 36) is the temper-
ature at which the oil ignites and burns for 5 s.
Of the available test methods (ASTM, 2000), the most common method
of determining the ﬂash point conﬁnes the vapor (closed cup) until the
instant the ﬂame is applied (ASTM D-56, ASTM D-93, ASTM D-3828,
ASTM D-6450, IP 34, IP 94, IP 303). An alternate method that does not
conﬁne the vapor (open cup method (ASTM D-92, ASTM D-1310, IP 36)
gives slightly higher values of the ﬂash point.
The ﬂash point is sometimes to be found in a mineral oil speciﬁcation,
but the value is not usually of much signiﬁcance and is merely laid down as
some assurance against undue ﬁre risk. Typical values will be from 150°C
(302°F) upward, depending on viscosity.The closed test (IP 34) is commonly
used, and a minimum value of 140°C (284°F) is required for transformer
oil to limit ﬁre risk. The stipulation of a suitable ﬂash point also automati-
cally limits the volatility of the oil, and for this reason the loss on heating
(IP 46) can be important to restrict excessive volatility.This can be achieved
by setting a suitable minimum ﬂash point on the order of 125°C (257°F).
Fewer volatility problems arise with the heavier cable oils or oil-based
cable impregnating compounds, although here also a minimum ﬂash point
of approximately 230°C (446°F) is frequently speciﬁed as a precaution
against the presence of lighter (and hence undesirably volatile) components
that could be troublesome at impregnating conditions of over 100°C
(212°F) and high vacuum.
Rubber compounders often use ﬂash point (ASTM D-92, IP 36, ASTM
D 93, IP 34) as a measure of oil volatility. Volatility is important because
rubber products are exposed to elevated temperatures during mixing
operations and, often, in service. Although ﬂash point has a certain utility
for this purpose, it gives no indication of the amount of low-boiling mate-
rial present. Therefore, a distillation curve should be used when volatility is
a critical factor.
11.3.12. Interfacial Tension
The measurement of interfacial tension (ASTM D-971, ASTM D-2285)
between oil and water is a sensitive method for determining traces of polar
contaminants, including products of oil oxidation, and minimum values will
sometimes be found in insulating oil speciﬁcations. The test is frequentlytest methods 261used to assess transformer oil deterioration and thus to maintain a check
on the quality of oil in electrical equipment.
11.3.13. Iodine Value
The iodine number (iodine value) test method (ASTM D-2078, IP 84) is
included in some speciﬁcations and is a measure of fatty acid components
or unsaturation either as oleﬁns and/or aromatics. The former are very
unlikely to be present in any oil that has undergone sufﬁcient reﬁning to
make it colorless, whereas the aromatic content can be controlled by setting
a suitable value for the ultraviolet absorption.
In the test method (ASTM D-2078), a sample is dissolved in chloroform
and reacted with Wijs solution for 30 min in the dark at 25°C. At the end
of the reaction, the solution is mixed with potassium iodide (KI) and
titrated with sodium thiosulfate and starch indicator and compared to a
blank determination.
The bromine number is the number of grams of bromine that will react
with 100 g of the sample under the test conditions and is better suited to
the determination of unsaturated constituents in oil (ASTM D-875, ASTM
D-1159, ASTM D-2710, IP 130). The magnitude of the bromine number 
is used as a measure of aliphatic unsaturation in petroleum products. In 
the test, a known weight of the sample dissolved in a speciﬁed solvent 
maintained at 0–5°C (32–41°F) is titrated with standard bromide-bromate
solution. Determination of the end point is method dependent.
11.3.14. Oxidation Stability
Very many oxidation tests for transformer oils have been used at one time
or another. Most of these tests are of a similar pattern: The oil is heated
and subjected to oxidation by either air or oxygen and usually in the pre-
sence of a metallic catalyst, almost invariably copper, which is the main
active metal in transformer construction. Temperatures and duration have
varied within wide limits, from 95 to 150°C (203–302°F) and from 14 to
672 h.
In one test method (ASTM D-943), the oil is maintained at 100°C
(212°F) for up to 1 week, during which time oxygen is passed through the
oil, in which metallic copper is immersed.At the end of the oxidation period
the amount of solid deterioration products ( sludge ) is measured, after such
sludge has been precipitated by dilution of the aged oil with n-heptane, and
the soluble ( acid) decomposition products are also measured by determi-
nation of the neutralization value of the aged oil.
To shorten the time for the oxidation test method, a test for sludge for-
mation in transformer oil by high-pressure oxidation bomb has been devel-262 mineral oil (white oil)oped (ASTM D-1313) in which oxidation is carried out at 140°C (284°F)"
"under pressurized oxygen for 24h and the sludge formed is separated and
weighed. A somewhat similar test, designed for inhibited oils, operates at
the same temperature but lower pressure and employs a copper catalyst
(ASTM D-2112).
One criticism of such tests is that sludge precipitation is carried out with
precipitation naphtha . Although the characteristics of this mixture are
deﬁned, it is a complex hydrocarbon mixture whose composition can vary
widely even within the range of prescribed properties. This could give rise
to varying precipitation capabilities in various batches of such naphtha, a
disadvantage that cannot occur when a pure chemical such as n-heptane 
is used as precipitant (ASTM D-3279, ASTM D-4124, IP 143). Another 
criticism is that the pressurized oxygen might be capable of changing the
chemistry of the oxidation reaction and that the oxidation conditions do
not represent the service conditions.
Although most transformer oil oxidation tests are of the air- or oxygen-
blowing type, many methods of assessing cable oil deterioration depend on
static oxidation, that is, the oil and air are in contact but such contact is not
stimulated. A catalyst is sometimes, but not invariably, used. Thus, in the
open beaker oxidative aging test (ASTM D-l934), the oil is exposed to
moving air at 115°C (239°F) for 96 h but a metallic catalyst is optional. The
metal is not speciﬁed, although copper is most frequently used in oxidation
tests on insulating oils. Characteristics to be determined after aging are
again left open in the test description, although acidity and electrical 
conductivity (both AC and DC) are the most common. Color is sometimes
included, but the limited amount of information that this conveys has
already been commented upon.
A transformer oil should not contain levels of unsaturated components
(aromatics and/or oleﬁns) that affect the oxidation resistance of the oil
(ASTM D-2300). Another type of test (ASTM D-2298) exposes the
degassed oil to electric stress, in a vacuum and at room temperature, the
amount of gas evolved at the end of 1000 min being measured.
Acidity (ASTM D-974, IP 1, IP 139) after oxidation is another criterion
by which the extent of oil deterioration is judged.
11.3.15. Pour Point
The pour point provides a means of determining the type of petroleum
feedstock from which the mineral oil was manufactured or its previous 
processing history. It also reﬂects the presence of wax or parafﬁnic hydro-
carbons. In any application in which the mineral oil is used at low tempera-
tures or the oil is subjected during handling or storage to low temperatures,
the pour point is important and, perhaps, even critical.test methods 263In the pour point test (ASTM D-97, IP 15), the oil is heated to a speci-
ﬁed temperature that is dependent on the anticipated pour point range,
cooled at a speciﬁed rate, and examined at 3°C (5°F) intervals for ﬂow. The
lowest temperature at which no movement of the oil is detected is recorded.
The 3°C (5°F) temperature value immediately preceding the recorded tem-
perature is deﬁned as the pour point.
For the pour point of transformer oils, a value below the lowest ambient
temperature to be expected must be set according to the speciﬁcations.
Most oils have a pour point that is typically on the order of –40°C (–40°F).
11.3.16. Refractive Index
The refractive index (ASTM D-1218, ASTM D-1747) is the ratio of the
velocity of light in air to its velocity in the substance under examination.
It is used, together with density and viscosity measurements, in calculating
the parafﬁn-naphthene ratio in mineral oils. Because refractive index is a
measure of aromaticity and unsaturation on a given stock, manufacturers
also use it as a means of process control.
The refractive index is also needed to calculate the refractivity intercept
in the determination of carbon type composition (Speight, 2000).
11.3.17. Smoke Point
The smoke point is of particular interest to industries, such as the baking
industry, whose processes expose or use mineral oil at extremely high 
temperatures.
The smoke point test (ASTM D-1322, IP 57), originally developed for
kerosene, is conducted with an enclosed wick-fed lamp suitably vented and
illuminated to permit detection of vapors. The oil is carefully heated under
speciﬁed conditions until the ﬁrst consistent appearance of vapors is
detected. The temperature of the oil at that time is recorded as the smoke
point. If necessary, this test can be adapted for use with mineral oil. The
character of the ﬂame is an indicator of the aromatics content.
11.3.18. Speciﬁc Optical Dispersion
The speciﬁc optical dispersion (ASTM D-1807) serves as an indication of
aromatic content. The difference in refractive index of the oil as measured
at two wavelengths is determined, divided by the relative density (all mea-
surements are at the same temperature) and multiplied by 100; values above"
"97 are stated to bear a direct relationship to the aromatic content of the oil.
If, however, there is reason to be particularly interested in the aromatic
content, it is preferable to assess this by one of the more direct methods.264 mineral oil (white oil)11.3.19. Ultraviolet Absorption
Considerable concern has been generated in recent years over the possible
presence of carcinogenic polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons in mineral
oils.
Detection of these chemicals by ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy
(ASTM D-2269) measures the absorbance over the wavelength range of
260–350 nm in a 10-mm cell of a dimethyl sulfone extract of the oil. The
polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons present in the mineral oils are concen-
trated. In fact, the ultraviolet absorption level corresponds, approximately,
to a maximum polynuclear aromatics content of about 5ppm.
For oils of a similar type, ultraviolet (UV) absorptivity is a good indica-
tor of the resistance of an oil to discoloration under exposure to artiﬁcial
or natural light. Oils with low absorptivity at 260nm have been found 
to impart good color stability to light-colored rubber compounds (ASTM
D-2008).
11.3.20. Viscosity
Viscosity (ASTM D-445, IP 71) is one of the most important properties to
be considered in the evaluation of a mineral oil.
Requirements for viscosity vary widely according to the user for which
the oil is intended and may be as low as 4cSt or as high as 70 cSt. Mineral
oil for internal use generally should have high viscosity to minimize possi-
bilities of leakage.
Viscosity data (ASTM D-445, IP 71) are used to ensure that, in the case
of oils for internal use as laxatives, unduly ﬂuid material, which could
increase risk of leakage through the anal sphincter muscle, is not used. The
minimum viscosity is usually on the order of 75 cSt at 37.8°C (100°F).
The temperature of viscosity measurement is a normal one employed for
this purpose and happens, in the case of medicinal oils, to be that of the
human body. Thus the viscosity of these oils is measured at their working
temperature.
Heavy cable oils are very much more viscous materials, and typical vis-
cosity values can be as high as about 200cSt at 60°C (140°F). Such oils are
probably the only petroleum products for which a maximum viscosity index
(ASTM D-227, IP 226) is sometimes speciﬁed, to ensure that, although the
oil will be as ﬂuid as possible at impregnating temperatures (100°C/212°F
or more), it will be sufﬁciently viscous to prevent draining at ambient 
temperatures in cases where cables are laid on a steep gradient.
The viscosity-gravity constant (ASTM D-2501) and the refractivity inter-
cept (r) have been used for characterizing oils of widely different viscosity
(ASTM D-2140).test methods 26511.3.21. Volatility
The distillation range for very mineral light oils provides information on
volatility, evaporation rates, and residue remaining after evaporation
(ASTM D-86, ASTM D-1160, IP 123).
Such data are important for agricultural and household sprays, agricul-
tural product processing, and printing inks. The baking and plastic indus-
tries often include initial boiling point temperature, the minimum allowable
temperature at which the ﬁrst several percent of the oil comes overhead
during distillation, or both as part of their speciﬁcations for mineral oils.
The test for evaporation (ASTM D-972) gives a measure of oil volatil-
ity under controlled conditions and is used frequently for speciﬁcation 
purposes. However, because volatility of oil from a rubber compound may
be inﬂuenced by its compatibility with the rubber, a volatility test of the
compound often is made under laboratory test conditions pertinent to 
the intended service.
11.3.22. Water
Water is obviously undesirable in electrical equipment, and the water
content of transformer and other insulating oils is frequently limited to a
low maximum value. Traces of water that would not inﬂuence the general
run of petroleum product tests could have a very signiﬁcant effect on prop-
erties such as electric strength.
Quantitative determination may be made by one of the many modiﬁca-
tions of the Karl Fischer method (ASTM D-l533). With careful application
of this technique, using electrical methods of determining the end point and
operating in a sealed system, water can be determined down to about 2ppm
or even less. Such sensitivity is, however, rather greater than is normally
required, and a water content of 35 ppm and preferably less than say 25ppm
is usually considered satisfactory.The solubility level of water in oil at room
temperature (say 20°C/68°F) will vary with the type of oil but is around
40 ppm. Amounts of water down to about 5ppm, in addition to being meas-
urable chemically, can also be determined by removing the water from the
oil by a combination of heat and vacuum and absorbing the freed moisture
in a suitable weighed phosphorus pentoxide (P 2O5) trap.
11.3.23. Wax Appearance Point"
"The wax appearance point is the temperature at which wax begins to pre-
cipitate (hence it is also called the wax precipitation point ) from an oil under
speciﬁed cooling conditions. Although more applicable to distillate fuel oil,
the wax appearance point can also have implications for mineral oil use. In266 mineral oil (white oil)the test method (ASTM D-3117), a sample of the oil is cooled under pre-
scribed conditions with stirring. The temperature at which wax ﬁrst appears
is the wax appearance point.

LUBRICATING OIL
12.1. INTRODUCTION
Lubricating oil is used to reduce friction and wear between bearing metal-
lic surfaces that are moving with respect to each other by separating the
metallic surfaces with a ﬁlm of the oil. Lubricating oil is distinguished from
other fractions of crude oil by a high ( >400°C/>750°F) boiling point (Table
12.1, Figure 12.1) (Gruse and Stevens, 1960; Guthrie, 1967; Berkley, 1973;
Weissermel and Arpe, 1978; Francis and Peters, 1980; Hoffman, 1983;Austin,
1984; Chenier, 1992; Hoffman and McKetta, 1993; Warne, 1998; Speight,
2000; Banaszewski and Blythe, 2000).
In the early days of petroleum reﬁning, kerosene was the major product,
followed by parafﬁn wax wanted for the manufacture of candles. Lubricat-
ing oils were at ﬁrst by-products of parafﬁn wax manufacture.The preferred
lubricants in the 1860s were lard oil, sperm oil, and tallow, but as the trend
to heavier industry increased, the demand for mineral lubricating oils
increased, and after the 1890s petroleum displaced animal and vegetable
oils as the source of lubricants for most purposes.
12.2. PRODUCTION AND PROPERTIES
Lubricating oil is a mixture that is produced by distillation, after which
chemical changes may be required to produce the desired properties in the
product. One such property requires that the oil adhere to metal surfaces
and ensure protection of moving parts by preventing metal-metal contact
(ASTM D-2510).
Petroleum base lubricating oils are present in the atmospheric residuum
(boiling above 370°C/698°F) of selected parafﬁnic and naphthenic crude
oils. The production of lubricating oils is well established (Sequeira, 1992;
Speight, 2000) and consists of ﬁve basic procedures:
1. Distillation and deasphalting to remove the lighter constituents of the
feedstock.
2692. Solvent reﬁning and/or hydrogen treatment to remove the non-
hydrocarbon constituents and to improve the feedstock quality.
3. Dewaxing to remove the wax constituents and improve the low-
temperature properties.
4. Clay treatment or hydrogen treatment to prevent instability of the
product.
Lubricating oil manufacture was well established by 1880, and the
method depended on whether the crude petroleum was processed prima-
rily for kerosene or for lubricating oils. Usually the crude oil was processed"
"for kerosene, and primary distillation separated the crude into three frac-
tions, naphtha, kerosene, and a residuum. To increase the production of
kerosene the cracking distillation technique was used, and this converted a
large part of the gas oils and lubricating oils into kerosene. The cracking
reactions also produced coke products and asphaltlike materials, which
gave the residuum a black color; hence it was often referred to as tar
(Speight, 2000; Speight and Ozum, 2002).
If the crude oil used for the manufacture of lubricating oils contained
asphalt, it was necessary to acid treat the steam-reﬁned oil before cold set-
tling. Acid-treated, settled steam-reﬁned stock was widely used as steam
cylinder oils.
The development of vacuum distillation led to a major improvement in
both parafﬁnic and naphthenic (low cold test) oils. By vacuum distillation
the more viscous parafﬁnic oils (even oils suitable for bright stocks) could270 lubricating oil

asphaltic components. Vacuum distillation provided the means of separat-
ing more suitable lubricating oil fractions with predetermined viscosity
ranges and removed the limit on the maximum viscosity that might be
obtained in a distillate oil.
Materials suitable for the production of lubricating oils are comprised
principally of hydrocarbons containing from 25 to 40 carbon atoms per 
molecule, whereas residual stocks may contain hydrocarbons with 50–60 or
more (up to ~80) carbon atoms per molecule. The composition of a lubri-
cating oil may be substantially different from that of the lubricant fraction
from which it was derived, because wax (normal parafﬁns) is removed by
distillation or reﬁning by solvent extraction and adsorption preferentiallyproduction and properties 271
Figure 12.1. Boiling point and carbon number for various hydrocarbons and petroleum products removes non-hydrocarbon constituents as well as polynuclear aromatic
compounds and the multiring cycloparafﬁns.
There are general indications that the lubricant fraction contains a
greater proportion of normal and branched parafﬁns than the lower-boiling
portions of petroleum. For the polycycloparafﬁns, a good proportion of the
rings appear to be in condensed structures and both cyclopentyl and cyclo-
hexyl nuclei are present.The methylene groups appear principally in unsub-
stituted chains at least four carbon atoms in length, but the cycloparafﬁn
rings are highly substituted with relatively short side chains.
Mono-, di-, and trinuclear aromatic compounds appear to be the main
constituents of the aromatic portion, but material with more aromatic
nuclei per molecule may also be present. For the dinuclear aromatics, most
of the material consists of naphthalene types. For the trinuclear aromatics,
the phenanthrene type of structure predominates over the anthracene type.
There are also indications that the greater part of the aromatic compounds
occur as mixed aromatic-cycloparafﬁn compounds.
In the majority of cases, chemical additives are used to enhance the prop-
erties of base oils to improve such characteristics as oxidation resistance
(ASTM D-2893,ASTM D-4742,ASTM D-5846) change in viscosity (ASTM
D-445, IP 71) with temperature, low-temperature ﬂow properties as derived
from the pour point (ASTM D-97, ASTM D-5853, ASTM D-5949, ASTM
D-5950, ASTM D-5985, IP 15) and ﬂuidity measurements (ASTM D-6351),
emulsifying ability (ASTM D-2711), extreme pressure (ASTM D-2782,
ASTM D-2783, ASTM D-3233, IP 240), antiwear and frictional properties
(ASTM D-5183,ASTM D-6425), and corrosion resistance (ASTM D-4636).
The selection of components for lubricating oil formulation requires knowl-
edge of the most suitable crude sources for the base oils, the type of reﬁn-
ing required, the types of additive necessary, and the possible effects of the
interactions of these components on the properties of the ﬁnished lubri-
cating oil.
Lubricating oils may be divided into many categories according to the
types of service they are intended to perform. However, there are two main
groups: (1) oils used in intermittent service, such as motor and aviation oils,
and (2) oils designed for continuous service, such as turbine oils. Thus the
test methods must be designed and applied accordingly."
"This classiﬁcation is based on the Society of Automotive Engineers
(SAE) J 300 speciﬁcation. The single-grade oils (e.g., SAE 20, etc.) corre-
spond to a single class and must be selected according to engine manufac-
turer speciﬁcations, operating conditions, and climatic conditions. At –20°C
(–68°F) a multigrade lubricating oil such as SAE 10W-30 possesses the 
viscosity of a 10W oil, and at 100°C (212°F) the multigrade oil possesses
the viscosity of a SAE 30 oil.
Oils used in intermittent service must show the least possible change in
viscosity with temperature; that is, their viscosity indexes must be high.272 lubricating oilThese oils must be changed at frequent intervals to remove the foreign
matter collected during service. The stability of such oils is therefore of less
importance than the stability of oils used in continuous service for pro-
longed periods without renewal. On the other hand, oils used in continu-
ous service must be extremely stable, but their viscosity indexes may be low
because the engines operate at fairly constant temperature without fre-
quent shutdown and thermal stability (ASTM D-2070, ASTM D-2511,
ASTM D-6205) is an important property.
12.3. TEST METHODS
The number of tests applied for product character and quality varies with
the complexity of the product and the nature of the application. The more
important tests, such as viscosity, ﬂash point, and color are usually per-
formed on every batch. Other tests may be on a statistical (or as-needed)
basis dependent on data that can be presented in the graphical form of a
ﬁngerprint that is speciﬁc for the blend of components and additives in a
particular formulation. Comparison of the ﬁngerprint with a known stan-
dard can be used as a check on the composition.
12.3.1. Acidity and Alkalinity
Unused and used petroleum products may contain acidic constituents that
are present as additives or as degradation products formed during service,
such as oxidation products (ASTM D-5770). The relative amount of these
materials can be determined by titrating with bases.The acid number is used
as a guide in the quality control of lubricating oil formulations. It is also
sometimes used as a measure of lubricant degradation in service. Any con-
demning limits must be empirically established.
Thus the acid number is a measure of this amount of acidic substance in
the oil, always under the conditions of the test. Because a variety of oxida-
tion products contribute to the acid number and the organic acids vary
widely in corrosion properties, the test cannot be used to predict corro-
siveness of an oil under service conditions.
The acid number is the quantity of base, expressed in milligrams of
potassium hydroxide per gram of sample, that is required to titrate 
a sample in this solvent to a green/green-brown end point with p-
naphtholbenzein indicator solution (ASTM D-974, IP 139). However, many
higher-molecular-weight oil products (dark-colored oils) that cannot be
analyzed for acidity because of obscurity of the color-indicator end point
can be analyzed by an alternate test method (ASTM D-664). The quality
of the mineral oil products renders them suitable for determination of the
acid number.test methods 273In a manner akin to the acid number, the base number (often referred
to as the neutralization number ) is a measure of the basic constituents in
the oil under the conditions of the test. The base number is used as a guide
in the quality control of oil formulation and is also used as a measure of oil
degradation in service.
The neutralization number , expressed as the base number , is a measure
of this amount of basic substance in the oil, always under the conditions of
the test. The neutralization number is used as a guide in the quality control
of lubricating oil formulations. It is also sometimes used as a measure of
lubricant degradation in service; however, any condemning limits must be
empirically established.
Samples of oil drawn from the crankcase can be tested to assess the
reserve of alkalinity remaining by determining the total base number of the
oil (ASTM D-664, ASTM D-2896, ASTM D-4739, IP 177, IP 276). Essen-
tially, these are titration methods in which, because of the nature of the used
oil, an electrometric instead of a color end point is used. The reserve alka-
linity neutralizes the acids formed during combustion. This protects the
engine components from corrosion. However, the different base number
methods may give different results for the same sample.
Lubricating oil often contains additives that react with alkali to form
metal soaps, and the saponiﬁcation number expresses the amount of base
that will react with 1 g of the sample when heated in a speciﬁc manner. In
the test method (ASTM D-94, IP 136), a known weight of the sample is dis-
solved in methyl ethyl ketone or a mixture of suitable solvents and the
mixture is heated with a known amount of standard alcoholic potassium"
"hydroxide for between 30 and 90 min at 80°C (176°F). The excess alkali is
titrated with standard hydrochloric acid, and the saponiﬁcation number is
calculated. The results obtained indicate the effect of extraneous materials
in addition to the saponiﬁable material present.
12.3.2. Ash
The ash formed by the combustion of lubricating oil (ASTM D-482, ASTM
D-2415, IP 4) is, as deﬁned for other products, the inorganic residue, free
from carbonaceous matter, remaining after ignition in air of the residual
fuel oil at fairly high temperatures. The ash content is not directly equated
to mineral content but can be converted to mineral matter content by the
use of appropriate formulae.
12.3.3. Asphaltene Content (Insoluble Constituents)
The asphaltene fraction (ASTM D-2006, ASTM D-2007, ASTM D-3279,
ASTM D-4124, ASTM D-6560, IP 143) is the highest-molecular-weight,274 lubricating oilmost complex fraction in petroleum. Insofar as the asphaltene content gives
an indication of the amount of coke that can be expected during exposure
to thermal conditions (Speight, 2000; Speight, 2001, Speight and Ozum
2002), there is little need for the application of the test to lubricating
mineral oil. Use of the oil under stressful conditions where heat is gener-
ated may introduce the need to determine the amount of insoluble con-
stituents precipitated by the addition of a low-boiling hydrocarbon liquid
to mineral oil.
Pentane-insoluble constituents can be determined by membrane ﬁltra-
tion (ASTM D-4055). In this method, a sample of oil is mixed with pentane
in a volumetric ﬂask, and the oil solution is ﬁltered through a 0.8- mm mem-
brane ﬁlter. The ﬂask, funnel, and ﬁlter are washed with pentane to com-
pletely transfer any particulates onto the ﬁlter, after which the ﬁlter (with
particulates) is dried and weighed to give the pentane-insoluble con-
stituents as a percentage by weight of the sample.
The precipitation number is often equated to the asphaltene content, but
there are several issues that remain obvious in its rejection for this purpose.
For example, the method to determine the precipitation number (ASTM
D-91) advocates the use of naphtha for use with black oil or lubricating oil
and the amount of insoluble material (as a % v/v of the sample) is the pre-
cipitating number. In the test, 10 ml of sample is mixed with 90 ml of ASTM
precipitation naphtha (which may or may nor have a constant chemical
composition) in a graduated centrifuge cone and centrifuged for 10 min at
600–700 rpm. The volume of material on the bottom of the centrifuge cone
is noted until repeat centrifugation gives a value within 0.1 ml (the precip-
itation number). Obviously, this can be substantially different from the
asphaltene content.
On the other hand, if the lubricating oil has been subjected to excessive
heat, it might be wise to consider application of the test method for deter-
mining the toluene-insoluble constituents of tar and pitch (ASTM D-4072,
ASTM D-4312). In these methods, a sample is digested at 95°C (203°F) for
25 min and then extracted with hot toluene in an alundum thimble. The
extraction time is 18 h (ASTM D-4072) or 3 h (ASTM D-4312). The insol-
uble matter is dried and weighed. Combustion will then show whether the
material is truly carbonaceous or it is inorganic ash from the metallic con-
stituents (ASTM D-482, ASTM D-2415, ASTM D-4628, ASTM D-4927,
ASTM D-5185, ASTM D-6443, IP 4).
Another method (ASTM D-893) covers the determination of pentane-
and toluene-insoluble constituents in used lubricating oils. Pentane-
insoluble constituents include oil-insoluble materials, some oil-insoluble
resinous matter originating from oil or additive degradation, or both.Toluene-
insoluble constituents can come from external contamination, fuel carbon,
highly carbonized materials from degradation of fuel, oil, and additives, ortest methods 275engine wear and corrosion materials. A signiﬁcant change in pentane- or
toluene-insoluble constituents and insoluble resins indicates a change in oil
that could lead to lubrication problems. The insoluble constituents meas-
ured can also assist in evaluating the performance characteristics of a used
oil or in determining the cause of equipment failure.
Two test methods are used: Procedure A covers the determination of
insoluble constituents without the use of coagulant in the pentane and pro-
vides an indication of the materials that can be readily separated from the
oil-solvent mixture by centrifugation. Procedure B covers the determina-
tion of insoluble constituents in lubricating oil that contains detergents and
uses a coagulant. In addition to the materials separated by using procedure
A, this coagulation procedure separates some ﬁnely divided materials that
may be suspended in the oil. The results obtained by procedures A and B
should not be compared because they usually give different values. The
same procedure should be applied when comparing results obtained peri-"
"odically on an oil in use, or when comparing results determined in differ-
ent laboratories.
In procedure A, a sample is mixed with pentane and centrifuged, after
which the oil solution is decanted and the precipitate is washed twice with
pentane, dried, and weighed. For toluene-insoluble constituents, a separate
sample of the oil is mixed with pentane and centrifuged. The precipitate is
washed twice with pentane, once with toluene-alcohol solution, and once
with toluene. The insoluble material is then dried and weighed. In proce-
dure B, procedure A is followed except that instead of pentane, a pentane-
coagulant solution is used.
12.3.4. Carbonizable Substances (Acid Test)
The test for carbonizable substances with sulfuric acid is not usually applied
to lubricating oil requirements. However, the need may arise and being
aware of the availability of such a test is warranted. In this test method
(ASTM D-565), a sample of the oil is treated with concentrated sulfuric
acid under prescribed conditions and the resulting color is compared with
a reference standard to determine whether it passes or fails the test. When
the oil layer shows no change in color and when the acid layer is not darker
than the reference standard colorimetric solution, the oil is reported as
passing the test. A bluish haze or a slight pink or yellow color in the oil
layer should not be interpreted as a change in color. The more fully reﬁned
the oil, the lighter the color of the acid layer.
However, with the introduction of ultraviolet absorption procedures
(ASTM D-2008, ASTM D-2269), the test ﬁnds less use but still provides a
useful method to determine possible contamination of lubricating oil with
impurities transparent to both visible and ultraviolet light and hence not276 lubricating oildetectable by color or by ultraviolet absorption measurements (ASTM D-
2008).
The test for carbonizable substances (ASTM D-565) should not be con-
fused with the test methods for determining carbon residue (ASTM D-189,
ASTM D-524, ASTM D4530, IP 13, IP 14, IP 398) (q.v.).
12.3.5. Carbon Residue
Lubricating oil is not usually considered to be used under the extreme con-
ditions under which coke is formed from, for example, fuel oil. Neverthe-
less, the tests that are applied to determine the carbon-forming propensity
of fuel oil (and other petroleum products) are also available for application
to lubricating oil should the occasion arise.
Thus the tests for the Conradson carbon residue (ASTM D-189, IP 13),
the Ramsbottom carbon residue (ASTM D-524, IP 14), and the microcar-
bon carbon residue (ASTM D4530, IP 398) are often included in inspec-
tion data for fuel oil.
In the Conradson carbon residue test (ASTM D-189, IP 13), a weighed
quantity of sample is placed in a crucible and subjected to destructive dis-
tillation for a ﬁxed period of severe heating. At the end of the speciﬁed
heating period, the test crucible containing the carbonaceous residue is
cooled in a desiccator and weighed and the residue is reported as a per-
centage (% w/w) of the original sample (Conradson carbon residue). In the
Ramsbottom carbon residue test (ASTM D-524, IP 14), the sample is
weighed into a glass bulb that has a capillary opening and is placed into a
furnace (at 550°C/1022°F).The volatile matter is distilled from the bulb, and
the nonvolatile matter that remains in the bulb cracks to form thermal coke.
After a speciﬁed heating period, the bulb is removed from the bath, cooled
in a desiccator, and weighed to report the residue (Ramsbottom carbon
residue) as a percentage (% w/w) of the original sample. In the microcar-
bon residue test (ASTM D-4530, IP 398), a weighed quantity of the sample
placed in a glass vial is heated to 500°C (932°F) under an inert (nitrogen)
atmosphere in a controlled manner for a speciﬁc time and the carbonaceous
residue [ carbon residue (micro) ] is reported as a percentage (% w/w) of the
original sample.
The data produced by the microcarbon test (ASTM D-4530, IP 398) are
equivalent to those by the Conradson carbon method (ASTM D-189, IP
13). However, the microcarbon test method offers better control of test
conditions and requires a smaller sample. Up to 12 samples can be run
simultaneously. This test method is applicable to petroleum and to petro-
leum products that partially decompose on distillation at atmospheric pres-
sure and is applicable to a variety of samples that generate a range of yields
(0.01% w/w to 30% w/w) of thermal coke.test methods 27712.3.6. Cloud Point
The cloud point is the temperature at which a cloud of wax crystal ﬁrst
appears in a liquid when it is cooled under conditions prescribed in the test
method. This test method covers only petroleum oils that are transparent
in layers 38 mm (1.5 in.) in thickness and have a cloud point below 49°C
(120°F). The cloud point is an indicator of the lowest temperature of the
utility of an oil for certain applications and it is usually higher than the pour"
"point (ASTM D-97, ASTM D-5853, ASTM D-5949, ASTM D-5950, ASTM
D-5985, IP 15).
The cloud point (ASTM D-2500, IP 219) of lubricating oil is the tem-
perature at which parafﬁnic wax, and other components that readily solid-
ify, begin to crystallize out and separate from the oil under prescribed test
conditions. It is of importance to know when narrow clearances might be
restricted by accumulation of solid material (for example, oil feed lines or
ﬁlters).
Neither the cloud point nor the pour point should be confused or inter-
changed with the freezing point (ASTM D-D 2386, ASTM D-5901, ASTM
D-5972, IP 16, IP 434, IP 435). The freezing point presents an estimate of
minimum handling temperature and minimum line or storage temperature.
It is not a test for an indication of purity and has limited value for lubri-
cating oil.
12.3.7. Color
Determination of the color of petroleum products is used mainly for man-
ufacturing control purposes and is an important quality characteristic. In
some cases the color may serve as an indication of the degree of reﬁnement
of the material. However, color is not always a reliable guide to product
quality and should not be used indiscriminately in product speciﬁcations
(ASTM D-156, ASTM D-1209, ASTM D-1500, ASTM D-1544, ASTM D-
6045, IP 17).
In one test (ASTM D-156) for the determination of color, the height of
a column of the oil is decreased by levels corresponding to color numbers
until the color of the sample is lighter than that of the standard. The color
number immediately above this level is recorded as the Saybolt color of the
oil, and a color number of +25 corresponds to water-mineral, whereas the
minimum color intensity reading on this scale is expressed by +30, a value
normally attained by mineral oils. In another test (IP 17), in which the meas-
urements are performed with an 18-in. cell against color slides on a scale,
a color of 1.0 or under is considered water-mineral and medicinal oils will
normally be 0.5 or less. Conversion scales for different color tests are avail-
able (ASTM D-1500).278 lubricating oilAlthough sometimes found in insulating oil speciﬁcations, the color char-
acteristic is of no technical signiﬁcance. Pale oils are, as a general rule, more
severely reﬁned than dark oils of the same viscosity, and color (ASTM D-
1500, IP 17) is not a guide to stability. Deterioration of color after submis-
sion of the oil to an aging test is sometimes limited, but here again extent
of oil deterioration can be much better measured by some other property
such as acidity development or change in electrical conductivity (ASTM D-
2624, ASTM D-4308, IP 274). About the only point that can be made in
favor of color measurement on new oil is that it can give an immediate
guide to a change in supply continuity.
12.3.8. Composition
The importance of composition of lubricating oils lies in the effect it has on
their compatibility (ASTM D-2226). This can often be determined by
studies of the composition. For example, molecular type analysis separates
an oil into different molecular species. One molecular type analysis is the
so-called clay-gel analysis . In this method, group separation is achieved by
adsorption in a percolation column with selected grades of clay and/or silica
gel as the adsorption media (ASTM D-1319, ASTM D-2007, IP 156).
Mass spectrometry can also be used for compositional studies of lubri-
cating oil (ASTM D-3239). This test method covers the determination by
high ionizing voltage, low-resolution mass spectrometry of 18 aromatic
hydrocarbon types and three aromatic thiophene types in straight-run aro-
matic petroleum fractions boiling within the range from 205 to 540°C
(400–1000°F). Samples must be nonoleﬁnic, must not contain more than 1
mass % of total sulfur, and must not contain more than 5% nonaromatic
hydrocarbons. The relative abundances of seven classes of aromatics in
petroleum fractions are determined by using a summation of peaks most
characteristic of each class. Calculations are carried out by the use of an
inverted matrix derived from the published spectra of pure aromatic com-
pounds. The aromatic fraction needed for this analysis is obtained by using
liquid elution chromatography (ASTM D-2549).
Aromatic content is a key property of hydrocarbon oils insofar as the
aromatic constituents can affect a variety of properties. An existing method
using high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (ASTM D-5292) is appli-
cable to a wide range of petroleum products that are completely soluble in
chloroform and carbon tetrachloride at ambient temperature. The data
obtained by this method can be used to evaluate changes in aromatic con-
tents of hydrocarbon oils resulting from process changes. This test method
is not applicable to samples containing more than 1% by weight oleﬁnic 
or phenolic compounds. The hydrogen magnetic resonance spectra are"
"obtained on sample solutions in either chloroform or carbon tetrachloridetest methods 279with a continuous wave or pulse Fourier transform high-resolution nuclear
magnetic resonance spectrometer. Carbon magnetic resonance spectra are
obtained on the sample solution in deutero-chloroform with a pulse Fourier
transform high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer.
The total quantity of sulfur in a gear oil due to the base oil and the addi-
tives present can be determined by a bomb method (ASTM D-129, IP 61)
in which the sulfur is assessed gravimetrically as barium sulfate. The copper
strip test (ASTM D-130, ASTM D-849, ASTM D-2649, IP 154) is used to
simulate the tendency of the oil to attack copper, brass, or bronze. Because
active sulfur is desirable for some extreme-pressure applications, a positive
copper strip result can indicate that the formulation is satisfactory, but care
is necessary in the interpretation of copper strip results because formula-
tions of different chemical compositions may give different results and yet
have similar performance in the intended application. Corrosion preventa-
tive properties are also measurable (ASTM D-4636).
The constituent elements (barium, calcium, magnesium, tin, silica, zinc,
aluminum, sodium, and potassium) of new and used lubricating oils can also
be determined (ASTM D-811). Corresponding methods for barium,
calcium, and zinc in unused oils are available (IP 110, IP 111, and IP 117,
respectively. For new lubricating oils ASTM D-874/IP 163 can be used to
check the concentration of metallic additives present by measuring the ash
residue after ignition. This latter method is useful to check the quality of
new oils at blending plants or against speciﬁcations.
The lead content of new and used gear oils can be determined by the
chemical separation method (IP 120). However, there are a number of
instrumental techniques that enable the results to be obtained very much
more rapidly, among which are polarographic, ﬂame photometric, and X-
ray ﬂuorescence methods. Chlorine can be determined by a chemical
method as silver chloride (ASTM D-808) or by a titration method (ASTM
D-1317, IP 118).
Phosphorus can serve as a beneﬁcial adjunct or as a deleterious agent.
There are several test methods for the determination of phosphorus. In
addition to the three test methods described here, reference should also be
made to multielement analysis methods such as inductively coupled plasma
atomic emission spectroscopy (ICPAES) (ASTM D-4951, ASTM D-5185)
and X-ray ﬂuorescence (XRF) (ASTM D-4927, ASTM D-6443) described
above in this guide. Phosphorus can also be determined by a photometric
procedure (IP 148) or by a test method (ASTM D-1091) in which the
organic material in the sample is destroyed, phosphorus in the sample is
converted to phosphate ion by oxidation with sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and
hydrogen peroxide, and the magnesium pyrophosphate is determined gravi-
metrically. Another method (ASTM D-4047, IP 149) in which the phos-
phorus is converted to quinoline phosphomolybdate is also available.280 lubricating oilThe extent and nature of the contamination of a used automotive engine
oil by oxidation and combustion products can be ascertained by determin-
ing the amounts of materials present in the lubricating oil that are insolu-
ble in n-pentane and toluene (ASTM D-893).
In this test, a solution of the used lubricating oil in pentane is centrifuged,
the oil solution is decanted, and the precipitate is washed, dried and
weighed. Insoluble constituents (precipitate) are expressed as a percentage
by weight of the original amount of used oil taken and include the resinous
material resulting from the oxidation of the oil in service, together with the
benzene-insoluble constituents. The latter are determined on a separate
portion of sample that is weighed, mixed with pentane, and centrifuged.The
precipitate is washed twice with pentane, once with benzene-alcohol solu-
tion, and once with benzene. The insoluble material is then dried and
weighed to give the percentage of benzene insoluble constituents that
contain wear debris, dirt, carbonaceous matter from the combustion prod-
ucts, and decomposition products of the oil, additives, and fuel.
Where highly detergent/dispersant oils are under test, coagulated
pentane-insoluble constituents and coagulated benzene-insoluble con-
stituents may be determined by using methods similar to those just
described but employing a coagulant to precipitate the very ﬁnely divided
materials that may otherwise be kept in suspension by the detergent/
dispersant additives.
Size discrimination of insoluble matter may be made to distinguish
between ﬁnely dispersed, relatively harmless matter and the larger, poten-
tially harmful particles in an oil (ASTM D-4055). The method uses 
ﬁltration through membranes of known pore size. Membrane ﬁltration
techniques are increasingly being used."
"The metallic constituents (barium, boron, calcium, magnesium, tin,
silicon, zinc, aluminum, sodium, potassium, etc.) of new and used lubricat-
ing oils can be determined by a comprehensive system of chemical analy-
sis (ASTM D-874, IP 163).
Turbine oil systems usually contain some free water as a result of steam
leaking through glands and then condensing. Marine systems may also have
salt water present because of leakage from coolers. Because of this, rust
inhibitors are usually incorporated. The rust-preventing properties of
turbine oils are measured by a method (ASTM D-665, IP 135) that uses
synthetic seawater or distilled water in the presence of steel. The oil should
also be noncorrosive to copper (ASTM D-130, IP 154).
The presence of water in turbine systems tends to lead to the formation
of emulsions and sludge containing water, oil, oil oxidation products, rust
particles, and other solid contaminants that can seriously impair lubrication.
The lubricating oil, therefore, should have the ability to separate from water
readily and to resist emulsiﬁcation during passage of steam into the oil untiltest methods 281a predetermined volume has condensed, and the time required for separa-
tion is measured (IP 19). Alternatively, the rate of separation of oil that has
been stirred with an equal volume of water is measured (ASTM D-1401).
These test methods are only approximate guides to the water-separating
characteristics of modern inhibited turbine oils, and the results should be
used in conjunction with experience gained of the particular service condi-
tions encountered.
Although systems should be designed to avoid entrainment of air in
the oil, it is not always possible to prevent this (ASTM D-892, IP 146).
The formation of a stable foam (ASTM D-892, ASTM D-3519, ASTM
D-3601, ASTM D-6082, IP 146) increases the surface area of the oil that
is exposed to small bubbles of air, thus assisting oxidation. The foam can
also cause loss of oil from the system by overﬂow. Defoaming agents are
usually incorporated in turbine oils to decrease their foaming tendency.
Air release is also an important property if a soft or spongy governor
system is to be avoided. A careful choice of type and amount of defoam-
ing agent will provide the correct balance of foam protection and air
release properties.
Dilution of an oil by fuel under low-temperature or short-distance stop-
start operation can occur frequently. Dilution of engine oil by diesel fuel
can be estimated from gas chromatography (ASTM D-3524), and gasoline
dilution can also be measured by gas chromatography (ASTM D-3525).
Low-temperature service conditions may also result in water vapor from
combustion products condensing in the crankcase (ASTM D-95, IP 74).
12.3.9. Density (Speciﬁc Gravity)
There are alternative but related means of expressing the weight of a meas-
ured volume of a product.
Both density (speciﬁc gravity) and API gravity measurements are used
as manufacturing control tests and, in conjunction with other tests, are also
used for characterizing unknown oils because they correlate approximately
with hydrocarbon composition and, therefore, with the nature of the crude
source of the oil (ASTM D-l298, IP 160).
For lubricating oil, the purpose of limiting density range is to provide 
a check on oil composition. In addition, a minimum density may offer 
some indication of solvent power as well as guarding against excessive
parafﬁn content. In this respect, the inclusion of density in a mineral 
oil speciﬁcation may duplicate the aniline point (ASTM D-611, IP 2)
requirement.
The API gravity (ASTM D-287, IP 192) is also used for lubricating oil
and is based on a hydrometer scale that may be readily converted to a rel-
ative density basis by use of tables or formulae (Chapter 2):282 lubricating oilAPI gravity, deg =(141.5/sp gr 60/60°F) – 131.5
API density is also a critical measure reﬂecting the quality of lubricating oil.
12.3.10. Flash Point and Fire Point
The ﬂash point gives an indication of the presence of volatile components
in an oil and is the temperature to which the oil must be heated under spec-
iﬁed test conditions to give off sufﬁcient vapor to form a ﬂammable mixture
with air.
The ﬁre point is the temperature to which the product must be heated
under the prescribed test conditions to cause the vapor-air mixture to burn
continuously on ignition. The Cleveland open cup method (ASTM D-92, IP
36) can be used to determine both ﬂash and ﬁre points of lubricating oils,
and the Pensky–Martens closed (ASTM D-93, IP 34) and open (IP 35) ﬂash
points are also widely used.
The ﬂash and ﬁre points are signiﬁcant in cases where high-temperature
operations are encountered, not only because of the hazard of ﬁre but also
as an indication of the volatility of an oil. In the case of used oils, the ﬂash
point is used to indicate the extent of contamination with more volatile oils
or with fuels such as gasoline (ASTM D-3607). The ﬂash point can also be"
"used to assist in the identiﬁcation of different types of base oil blend.
For used automotive engine oils that can be contaminated by a variety
of materials, the presence of diesel fuel constituents, resulting from low-
temperature or short-distance stop-start operation, can be approximately
estimated from measurements of the ﬂash point of the oil (ASTM D-92, IP
36) that is appreciably lowered by small quantities of fuel. The presence of
gasoline constituents can be measured by distillation (ASTM D-322, IP 23)
or by infrared spectroscopy.
Fire-resistant lubricating oil is used widely in the coal mining industry.
The use of such ﬂuids also is expanding in the metal cutting and forming,
lumber, steel, aluminum, and aircraft industries. A test is also available to
evaluate the ﬁre-resistant properties of lubricating oil under a variety of
conditions (ASTM D-5306). Most tests involve dripping, spraying, or
pouring the liquid into a ﬂame or onto a hot surface of molten metal, but
in this test the ﬂuid is impregnated into ceramic ﬁber media and the linear
ﬂame propagation rate, used for the comparison of relative ﬂammability is
measured.
12.3.11. Oxidation Stability
Oxidation results in the development of acidic products that can lead to
corrosion and can also affect the ability of the oil to separate from water.test methods 283Oxidation can also lead to an increase in viscosity and the formation of
sludge that can restrict oil paths, thus impairing circulation of the oil and
interfering with the function of governors and oil relays. Correctly formu-
lated turbine oils have excellent resistance to oxidation and will function
satisfactorily for long periods without changing the system charge. Oxida-
tion stability can be assessed by various tests (ASTM D-943, IP 114, IP 157)
that use copper as well as iron as catalysts in the presence of water to sim-
ulate metals present in service conditions.
Although systems are usually designed to avoid entrainment of air in the
oil, it is not always possible to prevent this, and the formation of a stable
foam increases the surface area of the oil that is exposed to small bubbles
of air, thus assisting oxidation. Defoaming agents are usually incorporated
in turbine oils to decrease their foaming tendency, and this can be meas-
ured (ASTM D-892, IP 146). Air release is also an important property, and
a careful choice of type and amount of defoaming agents is necessary to
provide the correct balance of foam protection and air release properties.
12.3.12. Pour Point
The pour point (ASTM D-97, IP 15) is the lowest temperature at which an
oil will ﬂow under speciﬁed test conditions, and it is roughly equivalent to
the tendency of the oil to cease to ﬂow from a gravity-fed system or from
a container and is a guide to, but not an exact measure of, the temperature
at which ﬂow ceases under the service conditions of a speciﬁc system.
The pour point of wax-containing oils can be reduced by the use of
special additives known as pour point depressants that inhibit the growth
of wax crystals, thus preventing the formation of a solid structure. It is a
recognized property of oil of this type that previous thermal history may
affect the measured pour point. The test procedure (ASTM D-97, IP 15)
also permits some measurement of the effect of thermal conditions on waxy
oils.
The importance of the pour point to the user of lubricants is limited to
applications where low temperatures are likely to inﬂuence oil ﬂow.
Obvious examples are refrigerator lubricants and automotive engine oils in
cold climates. Any pump installed in outside locations where temperatures
periodically fall below freezing should utilize lubricants with a pour point
below those temperatures or the borderline pumping temperature can be
determined by a designated test method (ASTM D-3829).
12.3.13. Thermal Stability
The panel coking test, when used in conjunction with other tests, can be
used to assess the deposit-forming tendencies due to thermal instability, and284 lubricating oilthe available alkalinity of these oils can be measured (ASTM D-66, IP 177
IP 276).
12.3.14. Viscosity
The viscosity of lubricating oil is a measure of its ﬂow characteristics. It is
generally the most important controlling property for manufacture and for
selection to meet a particular application. The viscosity of a mineral oil
changes with temperature but not normally with high stress and shear rate
(ASTM D-5275,ASTM D-5481,ASTM D-5684, IP 294), unless speciﬁc addi-
tives that may not be shear stable are included to modify the viscosity-
temperature characteristics. Explosions can also result when lubricating oil
is in contact with certain metals under high shear conditions (ASTM D-3115).
Thus for base oils, the rate of ﬂow of the oil through a pipe or capillary
tube is directly proportional to the pressure applied. This property is meas-
ured for most practical purposes by timing the ﬂow of a ﬁxed amount of oil"
"through a calibrated glass capillary tube under gravitational force at a stan-
dard temperature and is known as the kinematic viscosity of the oil (ASTM
D-445, IP 71). The unit of viscosity used in conjunction with this method is
the centistoke (cSt), but this may be converted into the other viscosity
systems (Saybolt, Redwood, Engler) by means of conversion formulae. At
very high pressures, the viscosity of mineral oils increases considerably with
increase in pressure, the extent depending on the crude source of the oil
and on the molecular weight (ASTM D-2502, ASTM D-2878) of the con-
stituent components.
Because the main objective of lubrication is to provide a ﬁlm between
load-bearing surfaces, the selection of the correct viscosity for the oil is
aimed at a balance between a viscosity high enough to prevent the lubri-
cated surfaces from contacting and low enough to minimize energy losses
through excessive heat generation caused by having too viscous a lubricant
(ASTM D-2422, BS-4231).
The standard viscosity temperature charts (ASTM D-341) are useful for
estimating viscosity at the various temperatures that are likely to be
encountered in service.
The viscosity of automotive engine oil is the main controlling property
for manufacture and for selection to meet the particular service condition
using the American Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) viscosity clas-
siﬁcation. The higher-viscosity oils are standardized at 210°F (99°C), and
the lighter oils that are intended for use in cold weather conditions are stan-
dardized at 0°F (–18°C).
The principal difference between the requirements of gas and other
internal combustion engine oils is the necessity to withstand the degrada-
tion that can occur from accumulation of oxides of nitrogen in the oil thattest methods 285are formed by combustion. The condition of gas engine oils in large engines
can be followed by measuring oil viscosity increase (ASTM D-66, ASTM
D-97, IP 177, IP 139) to determine changes in the neutralization value
resulting from oxidation. In addition, analytical techniques such as infrared
spectroscopy and membrane ﬁltration can be used to check for nitration of
the oil and buildup of suspended carbonaceous material.
The viscosity index is an empirical number that indicates the effect of
change of temperature on the viscosity of an oil.
Multigrade motor oils do not behave as Newtonian oils, and the
improved viscosity-temperature characteristics of multigrade oils enables,
for example, an oil to be formulated to have mixed characteristics (ASTM
D-2602, ASTM D-3829).
The viscosity index is important in applications in which an appreciable
change in temperature of the lubricating oil could affect the operating char-
acteristics of the equipment. Automatic transmissions for passenger vehi-
cles are an example of this, where high-viscosity-index oils with improvers
are used to minimize differences between a viscosity low enough to permit
a sufﬁciently rapid gear shift when starting under cold conditions and a vis-
cosity adequate at the higher temperatures encountered in normal running.
Parafﬁnic oils have the lowest rate of change of viscosity with tempera-
ture (highest viscosity index), whereas the naphthenic/aromatic oils have
the highest rate of change (lowest viscosity index) (ASTM D-567, ASTM
D-2270, IP 73, IP 226).
The viscosity index of multigrade automotive engine oils is typically in
the range of 130–190, whereas monograde oils are usually between 85 and
105. The improved viscosity-temperature characteristics of multigrade oils
enables, for example, an SAE 20W/50 oil to be formulated that spans SAE
20W viscosity characteristics at low temperatures and SAE 40 to 50 char-
acteristics at the working temperature.
However, multigrade oils do not behave as Newtonian ﬂuids and this is
primarily due to the presence of polymeric viscosity index improvers. The
result is that the viscosity of multigrade oils is generally higher at –18°C
(0°F) than is predicted by extrapolation from 38°C (100°F) and 99°C
(210°F) data, the extent of the deviation varying with the type and amount
of viscosity index improver used. To overcome this, the SAE classiﬁcation
is based on a measured viscosity at –18°C (0°F) using a laboratory test
apparatus known as a cold cranking simulator (ASTM D-2602).
12.3.15. Volatility
The volatility of lubricating oil is not usually an issue for multitesting.
Nevertheless, tests are available so that speciﬁcation and purity checks 
can be made (ASTM D-5480).286 lubricating oilA method that is used to determine pitch volatility (ASTM D-4893)
might also be used, on occasion, to determine the nonvolatility of lubricat-
ing oil. In the method, an aluminum dish containing about 15 g of accu-
rately weighed sample is introduced into the cavity of a metal block heated
and maintained at 350°C (662°F). After 30 min, during which the volatiles
are swept away from the surface of the sample by preheated nitrogen, the"
"residual sample is taken out and allowed to cool down in the desiccator.
Nonvolatility is determined by the sample weight remaining and is reported
as percent w/w residue.
A test is also available for the determination of engine oil volatility at
371°C (700°F), which is actually a requirement in some lubricant speciﬁca-
tions (ASTM D-6417). This test method can be used on lubricant products
not within the scope of other test methods with simulated distillation
methodologies (ASTM D-2887). Applicability of this test method is limited
to samples with an initial boiling point higher than 126°C. This test method
may be applied to both lubricant oil base stocks and ﬁnished lubricants con-
taining additive packages.
In the test, a sample aliquot diluted with a viscosity-reducing solvent is
introduced into the gas chromatographic system, which uses a nonpolar
open tubular capillary gas chromatographic column for eluting the hydro-
carbon components of the sample in the order of increasing boiling point.
The column oven temperature is raised at a reproducible linear rate to
effect separation of the hydrocarbons. Quantitation is achieved with a ﬂame
ionization detector. The sample retention times are compared with those of
known hydrocarbon mixtures, and the cumulative corrected area of the
sample determined to the 371°C (700°F) retention time is used to calculate
the percentage of oil volatilized at 371°C (700°F).
12.3.16. Water and Sediment
Knowledge of the water content of petroleum products is important in
reﬁning, purchase and sale, and transfer of products and is useful in pre-
dicting the quality and performance characteristics of the products.
The Karl Fischer test method ASTM D-6304) can be applied to the direct
determination of water in lubricating oil. In this method, the sample injec-
tion in the titration vessel can be done volumetrically or gravimetrically.
The instrument automatically titrates the sample and displays the result at
the end of the titration. Viscous samples can be analyzed by using a water
vaporizer accessory that heats the sample in the evaporation chamber, and
the vaporized water is carried into the Karl Fischer titration cell by a dry,
inert carrier gas.
Sediment in lubricating oil can lead to system malfunction in critical
applications, and determination of the amount of sediment is a necessity. Intest methods 287the test method (ASTM D-2273), a 100-ml sample of oil is mixed with 
50 ml of ASTM precipitation naphtha and is heated in a water bath at
32–35°C (90–95°F) for 5 min. The centrifuge tube containing the heated
mixture is centrifuged for 10 min at a rate of between 600 and 700 relative
centrifuge force (rcf).After the mixture is decanted carefully, the procedure
is repeated with another portion of naphtha and oil. The ﬁnal reading of
sediment is recorded. This test method is not applicable in cases in which
precipitated oil-soluble components will appreciably contribute to the 
sediment yield.
Insoluble material may form in lubricating oil in oxidizing conditions,
and a test method is available (ASTM D-4310) to evaluate the tendency of
lubricating oil to corrode copper catalyst metal and to form sludge during
oxidation in the presence of oxygen, water, and copper and iron metals at
an elevated temperature. This test method is a modiﬁcation of another test
method (ASTM D-943) in which the oxidation stability of the same kind
of oils is determined by following the acid number of the oil. In the test
method (ASTM D-4310), an oil sample is contacted with oxygen in the pres-
ence of water and iron-copper catalyst at 95°C (203°F) for 100 h.The weight
of the insoluble material is determined gravimetrically by ﬁltration of the
oxidation tube contents through a 5- mm-pore size ﬁlter disk. The total
amount of copper in the oil, water, and sludge phases is also determined.

GREASE
13.1. INTRODUCTION
Grease is a solid to semisolid product that consists of a lubricating ﬂuid that
has been gelled with a thickening agent so that the lubricant can be retained
more readily into the required area (ASTM D-4950) (Gruse and Stevens,
1960; Guthrie, 1967; Berkley, 1973; Weissermel and Arpe, 1978; Francis and
Peters, 1980; Hoffman, 1983; Austin, 1984; Chenier, 1992; Hoffman and
McKetta, 1993; Warne, 1998; Speight, 2000; Banaszewski and Blythe, 2000).
Grease is used to prolong the life and increase the efﬁciency of mecha-
nical devices by reducing friction and wear (ASTM D-4170,ASTM D-5707),
and there are speciﬁc performance requirements (ASTM D-3527, ASTM
D-4170, ASTM D-4289, ASTM D-4290, ASTM D-4693). Generally, a ﬂuid
lubricant (such as lubricating oil) is difﬁcult to retain at the point of appli-
cation and must be replenished frequently. On the other hand, a thickened
ﬂuid lubricant (grease) is easier to retain at the point of application, and
lubrication intervals can be extended.
Grease varies in texture from soft to hard and in color from light amber
to dark brown and, in contrast to liquid lubricants, will stay in place in a
bearing assembly with comparatively elementary mechanical seals. Grease
also assists in sealing against extraneous material and will lubricate without
constant replenishment.
13.2. PRODUCTION AND PROPERTIES
Grease is, essentially, a two-phase system comprised of a liquid-phase lubri-
cant (the liquid phase) containing a uniformly dispersed, ﬁnely divided
thickener (the solid phase).
The largest volume of grease in use is made from petroleum products
produced from naphthenic, parafﬁnic, blended, hydrocracked, hydro-
genated, and solvent-reﬁned stocks. In addition to petroleum oils, other
lubricating ﬂuids, such as esters, diesters, silicones, polyethers, and synthetic
hydrocarbons, are also used. Of the synthetic ﬂuids used in grease manu-
facture, the most common type is poly(alpha)oleﬁn (PAO).
291Grease is lubricating oil to which a thickening agent has been added for
the purpose of holding the oil to surfaces that must be lubricated. The 
most widely used thickening agents are soaps of various kinds, and grease
manufacture is essentially the mixing of soaps with lubricating oils. Until a
relatively short time ago, grease making was considered an art. To stir hot
soap into hot oil is a simple business, but to do so in such a manner as to
form a grease is much more difﬁcult, and the early grease maker needed
much experience to learn the essentials of the trade. Therefore, it is not sur-
prising that grease making is still a complex operation. The signs that told
the grease maker that the soap was cooked and that the batch of grease was
ready to run have been replaced by scientiﬁc tests that follow the process
of manufacture precisely.
The early grease makers made grease in batches in barrels or pans, and
the batch method is still the chief method of making grease. Oil and soap
are mixed in kettles that have double walls between which steam and water
may be circulated to maintain the desired temperature.When temperatures
higher than 150 ∞C (300∞F) are required, a kettle heated by a ring of gas
burners is used. Mixing is usually accomplished in each kettle by horizon-
tal paddles radiating from a central shaft.
The soaps used in grease making are usually made in the grease plant,
usually in a grease making kettle. Soap is made by chemically combining a
metal hydroxide with a fat or fatty acid. The most common metal hydrox-
ides used for this purpose are calcium hydroxide, lye, lithium hydroxide, and
barium hydroxide. Fats are chemical combinations of fatty acids and glyc-
erin. If a metal hydroxide is reacted with a fat, a soap containing glycerin"
"is formed. Frequently a fat is separated into its fatty acid and glycerin com-
ponents, and only the fatty acid portion is used to make soap. Commonly
used fats for grease making soaps are cottonseed oil, tallow, lard, and degras.
Among the fatty acids used are stearic acid (from tallow), oleic acid (from
cottonseed oil), and animal fatty acids (from lard).
To make grease the soap is dispersed in the oil as ﬁbers of such a size
that it may only be possible to detect them by microscopy. The ﬁbers form
a matrix for the oil, and the type, amount, size, shape, and distribution of
the soap ﬁbers dictate the consistency, texture, and bleeding characteristics,
as well as the other properties of grease. Grease may contain from 50% to
30% soap, and although the fatty acid inﬂuences the properties of grease,
the metal in the soap has the most important effect. For example, calcium
soaps form smooth, buttery grease that is resistant to water but is limited
in use to temperatures under about 95 ∞C (200∞F).
The soaps may be combined with any lubricating oil, from a light distil-
late to a heavy residual oil. The lubricating value of the grease is chieﬂy
dependent on the quality and viscosity of the oil. In addition to soap and
oil, grease may also contain various additives that are used to improve the292 greaseability of the grease to stand up under extreme bearing pressures, to act as
a rust preventive, and to reduce the tendency of oil to seep or bleed from
a grease. Graphite, mica, talc, or ﬁbrous material may be added to grease
that is used to lubricate rough machinery to absorb the shock of impact;
other chemicals can make a grease more resistant to oxidation or modify
the structure of the grease.
The older, more common method of grease making is the batch method,
but grease is also made by a continuous method. The process involves soap
manufacture in a series (usually three) of retorts. Soap making ingredients
are charged into one retort, and soap is made in the second retort.The third
retort contains ﬁnished soap, which is pumped through a mixing device in
which the soap and the oil are brought together and blended. The mixer
continuously discharges ﬁnished grease into suitable containers.
There are a variety of different types of grease that are produced with
speciﬁc functions in mind. Therefore, properties vary with the method of
preparation as well as with the metal included in the grease.
Calcium grease is resistant to water; it has a smooth texture, its chief use
is for plain bearings and low-speed rolling bearings, and it has a high roll
stability (ASTM D-1831). The water content of calcium grease usually
varies between 0.4% and l.0%, is present in the form of water of crystal-
lization, and has a stabilizing effect. High temperatures cause a loss of water
and a consequent weakening of soap structure, and therefore the use of this
grease is limited to a maximum temperature of about 60°C (140°F). Other
stabilizers and structure modiﬁers can now be used in place of or as well as
water, and the water content no longer has its former importance, for
example, in calcium hydroxystearate grease, some of which can be used up
to 120°C (248°F).
Calcium soap grease is one of the earliest known greases and is water
resistant and mechanically stable. Calcium soap grease usually has a low
melting point (dropping point; typically ~95°C/200°F). Anhydrous calcium
soaps (usually calcium 12-hydroxystearate) are somewhat more tempera-
ture resistant, having a dropping point of about 150°C (300°F). Anhydrous
calcium grease ﬁnds the greatest usage (when made with low-viscosity base
oil) in operations where a wide range of climatic conditions is essential.
Sodium (soda) soap grease is ﬁbrous in structure and is resistant to 
moderately high temperature but not to water. Sodium soap grease has a
high dropping point ( ~175°C/350°F) than calcium grease. However, it tends
to emulsify in the presence of water but has inherent rust protection prop-
erties. This grease is used for rolling bearings at higher temperatures and
speeds than normal conventional calcium soap grease. The sodium can be
determined by ﬂame photometry (ASTM D-3340).
Lithium soap grease is normally smooth in appearance but may exhibit
a grain structure. This type of grease is resistant to water and to the highestproduction and properties 293normal service temperatures and, because of the variety of types, is often
used as multipurpose grease. Lithium grease offers both the water resist-
ance of calcium soap grease and the high-temperature properties of sodium
soap grease. Grease prepared with lithium 12-hydroxystearate has a drop-
ping point of about 190°C (375°F). The lithium can be determined by ﬂame
photometry (ASTM D-3340).
Aluminum soap grease is translucent and can be produced with alu-
minum soaps made in situ .In the process, the preformed soap (usually 
aluminum distearate) is dissolved in hot oil in a mixing grease kettle, and"
"the hot mixture is poured into pans to cool.The cooling rate affects the ﬁnal
consistency. The ﬁnal product is a smooth, transparent grease with poor
shear stability but excellent oxidation and water resistance.Aluminum soap
grease is water resistant and adhesive but tends to have poor mechanical
stability and so is not suitable for rolling bearings.
Mixed soap grease (e.g., the sodium/calcium soap grease.) is manufac-
tured for uses that include high-speed rolling bearings. On the other 
hand, complex soap grease contains calcium, calcium/lead, or other metal-
lic complexes with fatty acids and acetate, benzoate, or other salts. The
complex soap grease has a high dropping point ( ≥260°C/ ≥500°F). In 
addition, complex soap grease has excellent antioxidation characteris-
tics as well as high resistance to water and good mechanical stability 
properties.
Aluminum complex grease has excellent water wash-off and spray-off
characteristics as well as high-temperature resistance and is widely used in
steel mill applications and automotive components subject to these condi-
tions. Calcium complex grease has inherent extreme pressure properties
(ASTM D-2596, ASTM D-5706) and provides good friction and wear per-
formance (ASTM D-4170). Lithium complex grease performance is gener-
ally like that of lithium 12-hydroxystearate grease except it has a dropping
point approximately 50°C (90°F) higher. Lithium complex grease provides
good low-temperature performance and excellent high-temperature life
performance in tapered roller bearings.
Clay-thickened grease is often referred to as nonmelting grease because
of its tendency to decompose before reaching the dropping point
(~290°C/550°F). This type of grease is water resistant and can be suscepti-
ble to severe degradation from other contaminants such as brine. The per-
formance is not often equivalent to that of the conventional calcium soap
grease or sodium soap grease Low-temperature performance could be con-
sidered satisfactory, but clay grease is not normally compatible with other
grease, and protocols are available using other property test methods
(ASTM D-566, ASTM D-2265, ASTM D-1831, ASTM D-1742, ASTM 
D-3527, ASTM D-4290, ASTM D-4049, IP 132) by which this can be 
determined.294 greaseExamples of other grease include the nonsoap types with high water
resistance and mechanical stability and some from selected organic com-
pounds; these are now being further developed for multipurpose use.
Treated clays or organic dyes of high temperature resistance along with 
synthetic heat-resisting ﬂuids are used for extreme temperatures. Nonsoap
grease often contains solid additives, such as graphite and molybdenum
disulﬁde (MoS 2) and is used under conditions of heavy loading (ASTM D-
2509, IP 326) or high temperature.
13.3. TEST METHODS
The standard tests used to determine the properties of petroleum and
petroleum products are commonly applied to grease. Among these are
aniline point (ASTM D-611), carbon residue (ASTM D-189, ASTM D-524,
ASTM D-4530, IP 13, IP 14, IP 398), ﬁre point (ASTM D-92), ﬂash point
(ASTM D-92), pour point (ASTM D-97), and viscosity (ASTM D-445).
However, because of the complexity of grease formulations and the variety
of uses, many other tests are also deemed necessary to estimate perform-
ance in service. Other tests not included in this chapter may be found else-
where under the test methods for lubricating oil (Chapter 12). Some
modiﬁcation of the test method may be necessary because of the different
character of grease vis-à-vis lubricating oil.
13.3.1. Acidity and Alkalinity
Grease may contain small amounts of free organic acids but should not
contain strong acids. In some conventional lime base grease small amounts
of free organic acids are intended as an aid to stability. Grease may also
contain small amounts of free alkalinity.
Methods of analysis (ASTM D-128, IP 37) are available for the meas-
urement of excessive acidity derived from oxidation. These methods cover
conventional grease that consists essentially of petroleum oil and soap.Thus
these test methods are applicable to many types but not all grease. The con-
stituents covered by the test series are soap, unsaponiﬁable matter (base
oil), water, free alkalinity, free fatty acid, fat, glycerin, and insoluble. A sup-
plementary test method is also provided and is intended for application to
grease that contains thickeners that are essentially insoluble in n-hexane
and to grease that cannot be analyzed by conventional methods because of
the presence of such constituents as nonpetroleum ﬂuids or nonsoap-type
thickeners, or both. These methods may not be applicable to grease analy-
sis when lead, zinc, or aluminum soaps are present or in the presence of
some additives such as sodium nitrite.test methods 29513.3.2. Anticorrosion Properties
Water resistance alone does not ensure that grease will protect bearings or
other mechanisms against moisture corrosion. Methods for assessing rust"
"prevention by grease have been described (ASTM D-1743, IP 220).
In the former method (ASTM D-1743), a tapered roller bearing is
packed with grease and after a short running-in period is dipped and stored
above distilled water. The bearing is then cleaned and examined for corro-
sion. In the latter method (IP 220), the grease is tested in a ball bearing
under dynamic conditions. The bearing is run intermittently in the presence
of distilled water and at the end of the test is rated for corrosion.
Grease should not be corrosive to metals with which it come in contact,
neither should it develop corrosion tendencies with aging or oxidation. A
polished copper strip (ASTM D-4048) (other metals can also be used) is
immersed in the grease that is stored at a temperature relevant to the use
of the grease (IP 112). The metal strip is examined for etching, pitting,
or discoloration. Alternatively, the test may be accelerated by storage of 
the grease and copper strip in an oxygen bomb under pressure (ASTM 
D-1261).
13.3.3. Composition
The lubricating ﬂuids that can be thickened to form grease vary widely in
composition and properties (Chapter 12).
An analytical procedure (ASTM D-l28) is available for the separation
of grease into its component parts and their measurement. Spectrographic
methods, such as ﬂame photometry (ASTM D-3340), may also be used to
determine the metal present as soaps or the wear elements in used grease,
in conjunction with separation techniques to measure and identify the
various types of fats, lubricating ﬂuids, or additives present. The simpler
tests that are more likely to be quoted are ash content, acidity and alkalin-
ity, water, and dirt content.
Minerals and inorganic salts are determined as ash by ignition (ASTM
D-128, IP 5),and the data include the bulk of clay-type nonsoap thickeners.
The method includes a rapid routine method and a procedure in which 
sulfuric acid is added to avoid loss of the more volatile oxides, and the 
result is reported as sulfated ash.
Microscopic methods are used in the examination of used grease for
particles that are an indicator of wear and are likely to be increased by
the presence of abrasive dirt in grease; foreign particles are counted and
graded for size under the microscope (IP 134) or by the extent to which
deleterious particles scratch plates of polished acrylic plastic (ASTM 
D-l404).296 greaseIn this method (ASTM D-1404), the test material is placed between two
clean, highly polished plates held rigidly and parallel to each other in metal
holders. The assembly is pressed together by squeezing the grease into a
thin layer between the plastic plates. Any solid particles in the grease larger
than the distance of separation of the plates and harder than the plastic will
become imbedded in the opposing plastic surfaces. The apparatus is so con-
structed that one of the plates can be rotated about 30° with respect to the
other while the whole assembly is under pressure, thereby causing the
imbedded particles to form characteristic arc-shaped scratches in one or
both plates. The relative number of such solid particles is estimated by
counting the total number of arc-shaped scratches on the two plates.
The test offers a rapid means for estimating the number of deleterious
particles in grease. However, a particle that is abrasive to acrylic plastic may
not be abrasive to steel or other bearing materials. Therefore, the results of
this test do not imply performance in ﬁeld service.
Some grease may contain traces of water (ASTM D95, IP 74), sulfur
(ASTM D-129), or chlorine (ASTM D-808, ASTM D-1317). Lithium and
sodium in grease can be determined with ﬂame photometry (ASTM 
D-3340).
13.3.4. Dropping Point
The dropping point (sometimes incorrectly used synonymously with
melting point ) is the temperature at which grease passes from a semisolid
to a liquid state. As the temperature is raised, grease softens to the extent
that it loses its self-supporting characteristic, the structure collapses, and
the grease ﬂows under its own weight; in a standard cup under standard
conditions, this is called the dropping point. The change in state from a
semisolid state to a liquid state is typical of grease containing soaps of con-
ventional types added as thickeners. These tests are useful in identifying
the types of grease and for establishing and maintaining benchmarks for
quality control.
The dropping point is useful (1) in establishing benchmarks for quality
control, (2) as an aid in identifying the type of thickener used in a grease,
and (3) as an indication of the maximum temperature to which a grease can
be exposed without complete liquefaction or excessive oil separation.
These test methods do not give identical results, and the dropping point
should be quoted in terms of the method used (ASTM D-566, ASTM D-
2265, IP 31, IP 132). The tests consist of heating a sample of grease (con-
tained in a cup suspended in a test tube) in an oil bath at a prescribed rate."
"The temperature at which the material falls from the hole in the bottom 
of the cup is averaged with the temperature of the oil bath and recorded
as the dropping point.test methods 297One test method (ASTM D-566, IP 132) is not recommended for 
temperatures above 288°C. In those cases, the alternate test method 
(ASTM D-2265) should be used.
13.3.5. Flow Properties
Grease is non-Newtonian in behavior, and, unlike oils, an initial shear stress
(yield value) must be applied before it will deform and commence to ﬂow.
It is this nonﬂowing characteristic that enables grease to offer certain
advantages over lubricating oils and results in its extensive use for the lubri-
cation of rolling bearings.
One test method (ASTM D-1092) uses a procedure in which the grease
is forced through short steel capillary tubes and the apparent viscosity 
is calculated as though the grease was in fact a Newtonian ﬂuid. The test 
can be carried out over a range of temperatures. It has been used as a low-
temperature test of grease pumpability (ASTM D-3245) and leads to a pro-
cedure for giving empirical data on ﬂow rates for handling grease in long line
dispensing systems. The borderline pumping temperature test method as
developed for engine oil (ASTM D-3829) may also be applied to grease,with
suitable modiﬁcation to accommodate the physical properties of grease.
The consistency of grease is a critical parameter that helps deﬁne its
ability to perform under given operating conditions. Consistency, as mea-
sured by penetration, is affected by temperature, but the penetration test is
not suitable for determining the minor, yet sometimes signiﬁcant, changes
in consistency as the grease approaches temperatures at which phase
changes in the thickener occur. Penetration is basically a ﬂow measurement;
in addition, other ﬂow measurements can be utilized to evaluate this prop-
erty at other conditions.
One test method (ASTM D-3232) can be used to evaluate ﬂow proper-
ties of lubricating grease under high-temperature, low-shear conditions.
In this method, a grease sample is packed into an annular channel in an 
aluminum block that is then placed on a hot plate capable of attaining 
temperatures in excess of 315°C (600°F) at a heating rate of 5 ±1°C (9 ±
2°F)/min. A special trident probe spindle, attached to a viscometer, is
lowered into the grease sample, and the hot plate is turned on. Simultane-
ously, the spindle is rotated at a constant 20 rpm, and torque measurements
are read from the viscometer every minute. Readings are continued until
the reading drops below 0.5 on the viscometer scale or until the maximum
sample temperature of interest is attained. With these data and an appro-
priate conversion equation, a plot of apparent viscosity versus temperature
is prepared.
Parameters that are important to grease behavior and utility are related
to ﬂow properties under pressure (ASTM D-2509, ASTM D-2596, ASTM298 greaseD-5706, IP 326) in determining the load-bearing properties of grease
(ASTM D-2509, IP 326) and the wear-preventive characteristics of grease
(ASTM D-2266, ASTM D-3704, ASTM D-4170). The signiﬁcance of these
tests is that they provide methods that can be used to differentiate among
grease with low, medium, or high levels of extreme-pressure properties.
13.3.6. Low-Temperature Torque
Grease becomes harder and more viscous as the temperature drops and in
extreme cases can become so rigid that excessive torque occurs within the
bearing and there is a need to determine the ability of grease facilitate to
machine starting and lubricating ability at subzero temperatures.
Measurement of low-temperature torque (ASTM D-1478) requires that
a pregreased ball bearing is cooled to the desired temperature and the start-
ing and running torques are determined at 1 rpm. This test method covers
the determination of the extent to which a grease retards the rotation of a
slow-speed ball bearing by measuring starting and running torques at low
temperatures lower than –20°C (lower than –4°F). In the test method, a No.
6204 open ball bearing is packed completely full of grease and cleaned off
ﬂush with the sides. The bearing remains stationary while ambient temper-
ature is lowered to the test temperature and held there for 2 h. At the end
of this time, the inner ring of the ball bearing is rotated at 0.05 r/min while
the restraining force on the outer ring is measured. Torque is measured by
multiplying the restraining force by the radius of the bearing housing. Both
starting torque and torque after 60 min of rotation are determined.
For applications with greater loads or larger bearings, another test
method (ASTM D-4693) can be used to predict the performance of grease
in automotive wheel bearings operating at low temperatures. This test
determines the extent to which grease retards the rotation of a tapered
roller bearing assembly. In this test, a sample of test grease is stirred and"
"worked and a speciﬁed amount is packed into the two test bearings. The
test assembly is heated to mitigate the effects of grease history; it is then
cooled at a speciﬁed rate to –40°C (–40°F). A drive mechanism rotates the
spindle at 1 rpm, and the torque required to prevent rotation of the hub is
determined 60 s after the start of rotation.
13.3.7. Mechanical Stability
The ability of a grease to withstand a large degree of mechanical working
without changing its consistency unduly can be important during the initial
clearing stages in a bearing or in certain applications, for example, in atest methods 299bearing assembly under vibrating conditions. The effects of mechanical
instability can lead in some cases to the grease becoming ﬂuid and losing
its sealing properties. Leakage (ASTM D-1263) from the assembly and
inadequate lubrication can then follow.
The test method used to evaluate the leakage tendencies of wheel bearing
grease (ASTM D-1263) provides a screening device that permits differenti-
ation between products having distinctly different leakage characteristics. In
the test method, the grease is distributed in a modiﬁed front-wheel hub and
spindle assembly. The hub is rotated at a speed of 660 ± 30 rpm for 6 h ±
5 min at a spindle temperature, which is raised to and then maintained at 105
± 1.2°C (221 ± 2°F). Leakage of grease, oil, or both is measured, and the con-
dition of the bearing surface is noted at the end of the test.
The tests most widely used to assess mechanical stability are the pro-
longed worked penetration test (ASTM D-217-IP 50) and the roll test
(ASTM D-1831). In the former test, the grease is subjected to a large
number of strokes (usually 100,000) in a motorized version of the worker
pot used for the penetration test at room temperature. In the roll test a
measured amount of grease is placed in a horizontally mounted drum in
which a steel roller rotates. The drum is turned about its axis, thereby sub-
jecting the grease to a milling action similar to that occurring in rolling bear-
ings. In both tests the difference in penetration of the grease, before and
after, is a measure of the grease breakdown.
13.3.8. Oil Separation
Grease will often separate oil during storage and, if too much oil separates,
the grease could harden to the extent that lubrication performance will be
affected. Oil will be released from a grease at varying rates depending on
the gel structure, the nature and viscosity of the lubricating ﬂuid, and the
applied pressure and temperature.
There are standard test methods (ASTM D 1742, ASTM D-3336, ASTM
D-3337, ASTM D-3527, ASTM D-4425, IP 121) for predicting the amount
of oil liberated by grease when stored in containers. In both methods the
grease is supported by a wire mesh screen; a weight or air pressure is applied
to the top surface of the grease to accelerate oil separation.
One particular method (ASTM D 1742, IP 121) is used to determine the
tendency of lubricating grease to separate oil when stored at 25°C (77°F)
at an applied air pressure of 1.72 kN/m2(0.25 psi). The test gives an indi-
cation of the oil retention characteristics of lubricating grease stored in both
normally ﬁlled and partially ﬁlled containers. The duration of this test is
either 24 h (ASTM D-1742) or 7 days (IP 121), and the data often corre-
late directly with oil separation that occurs in 16-kg (35 lb) containers of
grease stored at room temperature.300 greaseAnother test method (ASTM D-3336) is used to evaluate the perform-
ance characteristics of lubricating grease in ball bearings operating under
light loads at high speeds and elevated temperatures for extended periods.
Correlation with actual ﬁeld service cannot be assumed. In this test, the
lubricating grease is evaluated in a heat-resistant steel ball bearing rotated
at 10,000 rpm under light loads at a speciﬁed elevated temperature up to
370°C (700°F). The test is run on a speciﬁed operating cycle until lubrica-
tion failure or completion of a speciﬁed time.With superior grease, tests can
last up to several thousand hours.
In another test (ASTM D-3337), which is not the equivalent of long-term
service performance tests, the data can be used to predict relative grease
life at high temperature in a reasonable test period. In this test the bearing
is run at 12,000 rpm with speciﬁed axial load. Although a test temperature
of 250°C (482°F) may be speciﬁed, the equipment is capable of testing up
to 315°C (600°F) if high-temperature bearings are used.
Another test method (ASTM D-3527) is used for the evaluation of
grease life in tapered roller wheel bearings in a model front wheel assem-
bly run at 1000 rpm under a speciﬁed thrust load at 160°C (320°F) with a
cycle of 20 h on and 4 h off (ASTM D-4290).
13.3.9. Oxidation Stability
The storage stability of grease when packed into bearings is assuming 
considerable importance as more prepacked sealed-for-life bearings are"
"adopted in industry. In these bearings the grease acts as a protective until
the bearings are put into operation. Under such conditions thin ﬁlms of
grease in contact with steel or steel and bronze are exposed to air and 
moisture that promote oxidation of the grease, the products of which can
cause corrosion of the bearing surfaces.
In the test method used to evaluate storage properties under these 
conditions (ASTM D-942, IP 142), oxidation of a thin ﬁlm of grease is 
accelerated by heating the grease at 99°C (210°F) in oxygen at a pressure
of 110 psi. The amount of oxygen absorbed by the grease is recorded 
in terms of pressure drop over a period of 100 h and in some cases up to
500h. Grease that shows high oxygen absorption becomes ﬂuid, increases
in acidity and is generally considered unsatisfactory for use.
The oxidation induction time can also be used as an indication of oxi-
dation stability. No correlation has been determined between the results of
this test and service performance. In the test (ASTM D-5483) , a small quan-
tity of grease in a sample pan is placed in a test cell. The cell is heated to a
speciﬁed temperature and then pressurized with oxygen and is held at a
regulated temperature and pressure until an exothermic reaction occurs.
The extrapolated onset time is measured and reported as the oxidationtest methods 301induction time. This test method covers lubricating grease that is subjected
to oxygen at 500 psi and temperatures between 155 and 210°C (311 and
410°F).
13.3.10. Penetration
The cone penetration tests (ASTM D-217, ASTM D-1403, IP 50, IP 167, IP
310) are standard tests for determining the penetration of grease, and they
provide an indication of the consistency of grease.
One particular test method (ASTM D-217) consists of four procedures.
For unworked penetration, the cone assembly of the penetrometer is
allowed to drop freely into the grease sample at 25°C (77°F) in a worker
cup for 5 s. For worked penetration, the sample at 25°C (77°F) in a worker
cup is subjected to 60 double strokes by the grease worker. The penetra-
tion is determined immediately by releasing the cone assembly from the
penetrometer and allowing the cone to drop freely into the grease for 5 s.
For prolonged worked penetration, the procedure is the same as for worked
penetration, except that additionally before cone penetration, the sample
is subjected to a predetermined number of double strokes in the grease
worker. For block penetration, a cube of grease is used and the test is fol-
lowed as for unworked penetration. The depth of penetration, measured in
tenths of a millimeter, is the penetration value. A ﬁrm grease will have a
low penetration value and, conversely, a soft grease will have a high pene-
tration values.
The penetration varies according to the amount of shearing to which the
grease has been subjected. It may be measured on the grease as received
in its original container (undisturbed penetration), after transfer with
minimum disturbance to a standard container (unworked penetration),
after a standard amount of shearing (worked penetration), after a pro-
longed period of shearing in a mechanical worker (prolonged work pene-
tration), and as a ﬁrm sample (block penetration).
13.3.11. Thermal Stability
Thermal conditions have a profound inﬂuence on the properties and per-
formance of grease. And any one or more of several phenomena can occur
consecutively or, even more likely, simultaneously (ASTM D-3336, ASTM
D-3337, ASTM D-3527). Generally, grease having the least evaporative
losses (ASTM D-972,ASTM D-2595) will probably perform longer in high-
temperature service.
For example, grease softens and ﬂows easier with an increase in tem-
perature (ASTM D-3232), but the rate of oxidation of the grease also
increases (ASTM D-942, IP 142). In addition, evaporation of oil con-302 greasestituents also increases (ASTM D-972, ASTM D-2595) and the thickener
melts or loses its ability to retain oil (ASTM D-566,ASTM D-2595, IP 132).
In one test method (ASTM D-972), the evaporative losses from grease or
oils at any temperature in the range of l00–150°C (210–300°F) are deter-
mined.A weighed sample of grease is placed in an evaporation cell in an oil
bath at the desired test temperature. Heated air at a speciﬁed ﬂow rate is
passed over the sample surface for 22 h, after which the loss in sample mass
is determined. Another method (ASTM D-2595) used to supplement the
original method (ASTM D-972) was developed because of higher service
temperature and can be used to determine the loss of volatile materials from
a grease over a temperature range of 93–316°C (200–600°F). This test uses
an aluminum block heater instead of an oil bath (ASTM D-972) to achieve
higher temperatures and should not be used at temperatures in excess of the
ﬂash point of the base oil of the grease. Both tests can be used to compare
evaporation losses of grease intended for similar service, but the test results"
"may not be representative of volatilization that can occur in service.
13.3.12. Viscosity
Grease is a non-Newtonian material insofar as ﬂow is not initiated until
stress is applied.
The apparent viscosity of grease is measured in poises (ASTM D-1092)
and, because the apparent viscosity varies with both temperature and shear
rate, the temperature and shear rate must be reported along with the mea-
sured viscosity. In this test, a sample of grease is forced through a capillary
tube by a ﬂoating piston actuated by a hydraulic system using a two-speed
gear pump. From the predetermined ﬂow rate and the force developed in
the system, the apparent viscosity is calculated. A series of 8 capillaries and
2 pump speeds provide 16 shear rates for the determination of apparent
viscosities. The results are expressed in a log-log graph of apparent viscos-
ity as a function of shear rate at a constant temperature or apparent vis-
cosity at a constant shear rate as a function of temperature.
Apparent viscosity also is used to provide an indication of the directional
value of starting and running torques of grease-lubricated mechanisms.
Speciﬁcations may include limiting values of apparent viscosity for grease
to be used at low temperature.
13.3.13. Volatility
The effective life of grease, especially under high-temperature conditions,
is dependent on such factors as oxidation, retentive properties, and evapo-
ration of the base oil. Evaporation of the oil can result in the grease becom-
ing stiffer and drier and can ultimately lead to bearing failure.test methods 303The volatility of grease can be determined by a method (ASTM D-972,
IP 183) in which air is passed at a known ﬂow rate over a weighed amount
of grease in a standard cell that is immersed in an oil bath at a required
temperature. Because air is used some oxidation of the grease will occur,
but nevertheless a comparative rating for evaporation loss can be obtained
by measuring the loss in weight of the grease sample.
13.3.14. Water Resistance
The resistance of a grease to water contamination is an important property
because grease has to lubricate mechanisms where water will be present to
a greater or lesser extent.The presence of water can cause changes in grease
consistency, emulsiﬁcation with water-soluble soap base grease, and reduc-
tion in mechanical stability. The effects of such changes can lead to grease
being washed out of the mechanisms, resulting in inadequate lubrication
and poor protection against rusting. Most grease classed as water resistant
is able to take up large amounts of water without suffering the serious
changes mentioned above. It does not, however, follow that grease with high
water resistance will afford adequate protection against rusting unless rust
preventives are incorporated in the grease.
The most commonly used test for measuring water resistance is the water
washout test method (ASTM D-1264, IP 215) in which a greased ball
bearing is rotated at 600 rpm in an assembly with speciﬁed clearances in
the covers to allow entry of water from a water jet that impinges on the
face of one cover.The loss in grease pack after 1 h of operation is a measure
of the resistance to water. The test serves only as a relative measure of the
resistance of a grease to water washout.
Another test method (ASTM D 4049) is used to evaluate the ability of
a grease to adhere to a metal panel when subjected to direct water spray.
Test results correlate directly with operations involving direct water
impingement. In this test, a 0.79-mm ﬁlm of test grease is uniformly coated
onto a stainless steel panel; then water, at 38°C (100°F), is sprayed directly
on the panel for 5 min. The spray is controlled by speciﬁed spray nozzle,
pump, and plumbing. After the spraying period, the panel is dried and
weighed and the percentage of grease spray off is determined.

WAX
14.1. INTRODUCTION
Parafﬁn (petroleum) wax consists of the solid hydrocarbon residues
remaining at the end of the reﬁning process either in the lube stream (as
mainly parafﬁn and intermediate waxes) or in the residual lube stock tank
bottoms (as higher-melting microcrystalline waxes) (Gruse and Stevens,
1960; Guthrie, 1967; Gottshall and McCue, 1973;Weissermel and Arpe, 1978;
Francis and Peters, 1980; Hoffman, 1983; Austin, 1984; Chenier, 1992;
Hoffman and McKetta, 1993; Speight, 1999; Richter, 2000).
The waxy oil is fractionated to produce an oily wax called slack wax .This
is separated by solvent extraction and fractionated into different melting
point ranges to give waxes with a variety of physical characteristics.
Parafﬁn waxes consist mainly of straight-chain alkanes (also called normal
alkanes), with small amounts (3–15%) of branched-chain alkanes (or iso-
alkanes), cycloalkanes, and aromatics. Microcrystalline waxes contain high
levels of branched-chain alkanes (up to 50%) and cycloalkanes, particularly
in the upper end of the molecular weight distribution. Parafﬁn waxes
contain alkanes up to a molecular mass of approximately 600 amu, whereas
microcrystalline waxes can contain alkanes up to a molecular mass of
approximately 1100 amu.
During the reﬁning of waxy crude oils, the wax becomes concentrated 
in the higher-boiling fractions used primarily for making lubricating oils.
Reﬁning of lubricating oil fractions to obtain a desirable low pour point
usually requires the removal of most of the waxy components. The dewax-
ing step is generally performed by the chilling and ﬁlter pressing method,
by centrifuge dewaxing, or by ﬁltering a chilled solution of waxy lubricat-
ing oil in a speciﬁc solvent.
Wax provides improved strength, moisture prooﬁng, appearance, and low
cost for the food packaging industry, the largest consumer of waxes today.
The coating of corrugated board with hot melts is of increasing importance
to the wax industry. Other uses include the coating of fruit and cheese, the
lining of cans and barrels, and the manufacture of anticorrosives. Because
of its thermoplastic nature, wax lends itself to modeling and the making of
replicas; blends of waxes are used by dentists when making dentures and
307by engineers when mass-producing precision castings such as those used for
gas turbine blades. The high gloss characteristic of some petroleum waxes
makes them suitable ingredients for polishes, particularly for the “paste”
type that is commonly used on ﬂoors, furniture, cars, and footwear. The
highly reﬁned waxes have excellent electrical properties and so ﬁnd appli-
cation in the insulation of low-voltage cables, small transformers, coils,
capacitors, and similar electronic components.
14.2. PRODUCTION AND PROPERTIES
Parafﬁn wax from a solvent dewaxing operation (Speight, 1999) is com-
monly known as slack wax , and the processes used for the production of
waxes are aimed at de-oiling the slack wax (petroleum wax concentrate).
Wax sweating was originally used to separate wax fractions with various
melting points from the wax obtained from shale oils. Wax sweating is still
used to some extent but is being replaced by the more convenient crystal-
lization process. In wax sweating, a cake of slack wax is slowly warmed to
a temperature at which the oil in the wax and the lower-melting waxes
become ﬂuid and drip (or sweat) from the bottom of the cake, leaving a
residue of higher-melting wax. Sweated waxes generally contain small
amounts of unsaturated aromatic and sulfur compounds, which are the
source of unwanted color, odor, and taste that reduce the ability of the wax
to resist oxidation; the commonly used method of removing these impuri-
ties is clay treatment of the molten wax.
Wax crystallization, like wax sweating, separates slack wax into fractions,"
"but instead of using the differences in melting points, it makes use of the
different solubility of the wax fractions in a solvent, such as the ketone used
in the dewaxing process (Speight, 1999, Chapter 19). When a mixture of
ketone and slack wax is heated, the slack wax usually dissolves completely,
and if the solution is cooled slowly, a temperature is reached at which a crop
of wax crystals is formed.These crystals will all be of the same melting point,
and if they are removed by ﬁltration, a wax fraction with a speciﬁc melting
point is obtained. If the clear ﬁltrate is further cooled, a second crop of wax
crystals with a lower melting point is obtained. Thus by alternate cooling
and ﬁltration the slack wax can be subdivided into a large number of wax
fractions, each with different melting points.
Chemically, parafﬁn wax is a mixture of saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons
(with the general formula C nH2n+2).Wax is the residue extracted when lubri-
cant oils are dewaxed and it has a crystalline structure with a carbon number
greater than 12.The main characteristics of wax are (1) absence of color, (2)
absence of odor,(3) translucence,and (4) a melting point above 45°C (113°F).
Petroleum wax is of two general types, the parafﬁn waxes in petroleum
distillates and the microcrystalline waxes in petroleum residua. The melting308 waxpoint of wax is not directly related to its boiling point, because waxes
contain hydrocarbons of different chemical nature. Nevertheless, waxes are
graded according to their melting point (ASTM D-87, IP 55) and oil content
(ASTM D-721, IP 158).
A scheme for classifying waxes as either parafﬁn, semi-microcrystalline,
or microcrystalline is based on the equation
n2D=0.000194 3 t+1.3994
where tis the congealing point temperature in °F (ASTM D-938, IP 76).
Viscosity is included as an additional parameter.
Semi-microcrystalline wax and microcrystalline wax are petroleum
waxes containing substantial portions of hydrocarbons other than normal
alkanes. They are characterized by refractive indexes greater than those
given by the above equation and by viscosities at 210°F of less than 10 cSt
for semi-microcrystalline waxes or greater than 10 cSt for microcrystalline
waxes. Microcrystalline waxes have higher molecular weights, smaller
crystal structures, and greater afﬁnities for oil than parafﬁn waxes. Micro-
crystalline waxes usually melt between 66°C (150°F) and 104°C (220°F) and
have viscosities between 10 and 20 cSt at 99°C (210°F).
Petrolatum is usually a soft product containing approximately 20% oil
and melting between 38°C (100°F) and 60°C (140°F). Petrolatum or petro-
leum jelly is essentially a mixture of microcrystalline wax and oil. It is pro-
duced as an intermediate product in the reﬁning of microcrystalline wax or
compounded by blending appropriate waxy products and oils. Petrolatum
colors range from the almost black crude form to the highly reﬁned yellow
and white pharmaceutical grades.
The melting point of parafﬁn wax (ASTM D-87, IP 55) has both direct
and indirect signiﬁcance in most wax utilization. All wax grades are 
commercially indicated in a range of melting temperatures rather than 
at a single value, and a range of 1 ∞C (2∞F) usually indicates a good degree
of reﬁnement. Other common physical properties that help to illustrate
the degree of reﬁnement of the wax are color (ASTM D-156), oil con-
tent (ASTM D-721, IP 158), and viscosity (ASTM D-88, ASTM D-445,
IP 71).
14.3. TEST METHODS
14.3.1. Appearance
Waxed coatings provide protection for packaged goods, and the high gloss
characteristics provide improved appearance. Both the nature of the wax
and the coating process contribute to the ﬁnal gloss characteristics.test methods 309Specular gloss (ASTM D-1834) is the capacity of a surface to simulate a
mirror in its ability to reﬂect an incident light beam. The glossimeter used
to measure gloss consists of a lamp and lens set to focus an incident light
beam 20° from a line drawn perpendicular to the specimen. A receptor lens
and photocell are centered on the angle of reﬂectance, also 20° from a line
perpendicular to the specimen.A black, polished glass surface with a refrac-
tive index of 1.54 is used for instrument standardization at 100 gloss units.
A wax-coated paper is held by a vacuum plate over the sample opening.
The light beam is reﬂected from the sample surface into the photocell and
measured with a null-point microammeter.
The gloss is measured before (ASTM D-1834) and after (ASTM D-2895)
aging the sample for 1 and 7 days in an oven at 40°C (104°F). The speciﬁed
aging conditions are intended to correlate with the conditions likely to
occur in the handling and storage of waxed paper and paperboard.
14.3.2. Barrier Properties
The ability of wax to prevent the transfer of moisture vapor is of primary
concern in the food packaging industry. To maintain the freshness of dry
foods, moisture must be kept out of the product, but to maintain the quality"
"of frozen foods and baked goods the moisture must be kept in the product.
This results in two criteria for barrier properties: moisture vapor transmis-
sion rates (A) at elevated temperatures and high relative humidity and (B)
at low temperatures and low relative humidity, for frozen foods.
The wax blocking point is the lowest temperature at which ﬁlm disrup-
tion occurs across 50% of the waxed paper surface when the test strips 
are separated. The picking point is the lowest temperature at which the sur-
face ﬁlm shows disruption. Blocking of waxed paper, because of the rela-
tively low temperature at which it may occur, can be a major problem for
the paper coating industry. The wax picking and blocking points indicate 
an approximate temperature range at or above which waxed surfaces in
contact with each other are likely to cause surface ﬁlm injury.
To determine the blocking point of wax (ASTM D-2618,ASTM D-1465),
two paper test specimens are coated with the wax sample, folded with the
waxed surfaces together, and placed on a blocking plate that is heated at
one end and cooled at the other to impose a measured temperature gradi-
ent along its length. After a conditioning period on the plate, the specimens
are removed, unfolded, and examined for ﬁlm disruption.The temperatures
of corresponding points on the blocking plate are reported as the picking
and blocking points or as the blocking range.
The sealing strength of petroleum wax is determined in a test (ASTM
D2005) in which two paper specimens, 5 ¥10 in., are cut and sealed together
by passing them over a heated bar. The sealed papers are conditioned at310 wax73°F (23°C) and 50% relative humidity for 17–24 h. Test specimens,
10 ¥15 cm, are cut from the sealed paper and delaminated at the rate of
5in./min. The open ends of the seal are in the same plane, with a 180° angle
between the ends. The unseparated portion is perpendicular to this plane.
Sealing strength is the force measured in grams per centimeter required to
separate the sealed strips.
14.3.3. Carbonizable Substances
Wax and petrolatum intended for certain pharmaceutical purposes are
required to pass the test for carbonizable matter. The degree of unsatura-
tion (carbonizable material) is determined by reacting the wax with con-
centrated sulfuric acid. The resultant color of the acid layer must be lighter
than the reference color if the wax is to qualify as pharmaceutical grade.
The melting point (ASTM D-87, IP 55) for such grades may also be
required.
To determine the presence of carbonizable substances in parafﬁn wax
(ASTM D-612) 5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid is placed in a graduated
test tube and 5 ml of the melted wax are added. The sample is heated for
10 min at 70°C (158°F). During the last 5 min the tube is shaken periodi-
cally.The acid layer is compared with a standard reference solution, and the
wax sample passes if the color is not darker than the standard color.
14.3.4. Color
Parafﬁn wax is generally white in color, whereas microcrystalline wax and
petrolatum range from white to almost black. A fully reﬁned wax should
be virtually colorless ( water-white ) when examined in the molten state.
Absence of color is of particular importance in wax used for pharmaceuti-
cal purposes or for the manufacture of food wrappings. The signiﬁcance of
the color of microcrystalline wax and petrolatum depends on the use for
which they are intended. In some applications (for example, the manufac-
ture of corrosion preventives) color may be of little importance.
The Saybolt color test method (ASTM D-156) is used for nearly color-
less waxes, and in this method a melted sample is placed in a heated verti-
cal tube mounted alongside a second tube containing standard color disks.
An optical viewer allows simultaneous viewing of both tubes. The level of
the sample is decreased until its color is lighter than that of the standard
and the color number above this level is the Saybolt color.
The test method for the color of petroleum products (ASTM D-1500, IP
196) is used for wax and petrolatum that are too dark for the Saybolt col-
orimeter. A liquid sample is placed in the test container, a glass cylinder of
30- to 35-mm ID, and compared with colored glass disks ranging in valuetest methods 311from 0.5 to 8.0 by using a standard light source. If an exact match is not
found, and the sample color falls between two standard colors, the higher
of the two colors is reported.
The Lovibond tintometer (IP 17) is used to measures the tint and depth
of color by comparison with a series of red, yellow, and blue standard
glasses. Waxes and petrolatum are tested in the molten state, and a wide
range of cell sizes is available for the different types.
14.3.5. Composition
Almost all physical and functional properties of the wax are affected by:
1. The molecular weight range,
2. Distribution of its individual components, and
3. The degree of branching of the carbon skeleton."
"For a given melting point, a narrow-cut wax consisting almost entirely of
straight-chain parafﬁns will be harder and more brittle and will have a
higher gloss and blocking point than a wax of broader cut or one contain-
ing a higher proportion of branched molecules.
All petroleum-derived waxes, including blends of waxes, from n-C17to
n-C44can be separated by capillary column chromatography (ASTM D-
5442). In this method, the sample is diluted in a suitable solvent with an
internal standard, after which it is injected into a capillary column meeting
a speciﬁed resolution, and the components are detected with a ﬂame ion-
ization detector. The eluted components are identiﬁed by comparison with
a standard mixture, and the area of each straight-chain and branched-chain
alkane is measured.
The polynuclear aromatic content of waxes can be estimated by the
ultraviolet absorbance (ASTM D-2008) of an extract of the sample. In this
test method, the ultraviolet absorbance is determined by measuring the
absorption spectrum of the undiluted liquid in a cell of known path length
under speciﬁed conditions. The ultraviolet absorptivity is determined by
measuring the absorbance, at speciﬁed wavelengths, of a solution of the
liquid or solid at known concentration in a cell of known path length.
The composition of wax is available through alternate procedures that
involve solvent extraction (ASTM D-721, ASTM D-3235, IP 158), and the
refractive index (ASTM D-1747) can also give an indication of composi-
tion, but mainly purity.
The solvent-extractable constituents of a wax may have signiﬁcant effects
on several of its properties such as strength, hardness, ﬂexibility, scuff resist-
ance, coefﬁcient of friction, coefﬁcient of expansion, and melting point. In312 waxthe test method (ASTM D-3235), the sample is dissolved in a mixture of
50% v/v methyl ethyl ketone and 50% v/v toluene. The solution is cooled
to –32°C (–25°F) to precipitate the wax and then ﬁltered. The yield of
solvent-extractable constituents is determined by evaporating the solvent
from the ﬁltrate and weighing the residue.
14.3.6. Density (Speciﬁc Gravity)
For clariﬁcation, it is necessary to understand the basic deﬁnitions that are
used: (1) density is the mass of liquid per unit volume at 15°C; (2) relative
density is the ratio of the mass of a given volume of liquid at 15°C to 
the mass of an equal volume of pure water at the same temperature; (3)
speciﬁc gravity is the same as the relative density, and the terms are used
interchangeably.
Density (ASTM D-1298, IP 160) is an important property of petroleum
products because petroleum and especially petroleum products are usually
bought and sold on that basis or, if on a volume basis, then converted to
a mass basis via density measurements. This property is almost synony-
mously termed density, relative density, gravity, and speciﬁc gravity, all
terms related to each other. Usually a hydrometer, pycnometer, or more
modern digital density meter is used for the determination of density or
speciﬁc gravity.
In the most commonly used method (ASTM D-1298, IP 160), the sample
is brought to the prescribed temperature and transferred to a cylinder 
at approximately the same temperature. The appropriate hydrometer is
lowered into the sample and allowed to settle, and, after temperature equi-
librium has been reached, the hydrometer scale is read and the tempera-
ture of the sample is noted.
Although there are many methods for the determination of density
because of the different nature of petroleum itself and the different prod-
ucts, one test method (ASTM D-5002) is used for the determination of the
density or relative density of petroleum that can be handled in a normal
fashion as a liquid at test temperatures between 15 and 35°C (59–95°F).
This test method applies to petroleum oils with high vapor pressures pro-
vided that appropriate precautions are taken to prevent vapor loss during
transfer of the sample to the density analyzer. In the method, approximately
0.7 ml of crude oil sample is introduced into an oscillating sample tube and
the change in oscillating frequency caused by the change in mass of the tube
is used in conjunction with calibration data to determine the density of the
sample.
Another test determines density and speciﬁc gravity by means of a digital
densimeter (ASTM D-4052, IP 365). In the test, a small volume (approxi-
mately 0.7 ml) of liquid sample is introduced into an oscillating sample tubetest methods 313and the change in oscillating frequency caused by the change in the mass
of the tube is used in conjunction with calibration data to determine the
density of the sample. The test is usually applied to petroleum, petroleum
distillates, and petroleum products that are liquids at temperatures between
15 and 35°C (59–95°F) that have vapor pressures below 600 mmHg and vis-
cosities below about 15,000 cSt at the temperature of test. However, the"
"method should not be applied to samples so dark in color that the absence
of air bubbles in the sample cell cannot be established with certainty.
Accurate determination of the density or speciﬁc gravity of crude oil is
necessary for the conversion of measured volumes to volumes at the stan-
dard temperature of 15.56°C (60°F) (ASTM D-1250, IP 200, petroleum
measurement tables). The speciﬁc gravity is also a factor reﬂecting the
quality of crude oils.
14.3.7. Hardness
Hardness is a measure of resistance to deformation or damage; hence it is
an important criterion for many wax applications. It is indirectly related to
blocking tendency and gloss. Hard, narrow-cut waxes have higher blocking
points and better gloss than waxes of the same average molecular weight
but wider molecular weight range.
The measurement of the needle penetration of petroleum wax (ASTM
D1321, IP 376) gives an indication of the hardness or consistency of wax.
This method uses a penetrometer applying a load of 100 g for 5 s to a stan-
dard needle with a truncated cone tip. The sample is heated to 17°C (30°F)
above its congealing point, poured into a small brass cylinder, cooled, and
placed in a water bath at the test temperature for 1h. The sample is then
positioned under the penetrometer needle, which when released penetrates
into the sample. The depth of penetration in tenths of millimeters is
reported as the test value. This method is not applicable to oily materials
or petrolatum, which have penetrations greater than 250.
The method for the determination of the cone penetration of petrola-
tum (ASTM D937, IP 179) is used for soft wax and petrolatum. It is similar
to the method for determining the needle penetration (ASTM D-132l)
except that a much larger sample mould is used and a cone replaces the
needle. The method requires that a 150-g load be applied for 5 s at the
desired temperature.
14.3.8. Melting Point
The melting point is one of the most widely used tests to determine the
quality and type of wax because wax is, more often than not, sold on the
basis of the melting point range (ASTM D-87, ASTM D-4419, IP 55).314 waxPetroleum wax, unlike the individual hydrocarbons (Table 14.1) does not
melt at sharply deﬁned temperatures because it is a mixture of hydrocarbons
with different melting points but usually has a narrow melting range. Thus
measurement of the melting point (more correctly, the melting range ) may
also be used as a means of ﬁngerprinting wax to obtain more precise quality
control and detailed information. Microcrystalline waxes and petrolatum
are more complex and therefore melt over a much wider temperature range.
In the method (ASTM D-87, IP 55), a molten wax specimen is placed in
a test tube ﬁtted with a thermometer and placed in an air bath, which in
turn is surrounded by a water bath held at 16–28°C (60–80°F). As the
molten wax cools, periodic readings of its temperature are taken. When
solidiﬁcation of the wax occurs, the rate of temperature change decreases,
yielding a plateau in the cooling curve. The temperature at that point is
recorded as the melting point (cooling curve) of the sample. This procedure
is not suitable for microcrystalline wax, petrolatum, or waxes containing
large amounts of nonnormal hydrocarbons (the plateau rarely occurs in
cooling curves of such waxes).
The method of determining the drop melting point of petroleum wax,
including petrolatum (ASTM D127, IP 133) can be used for most petro-test methods 315

two thermometer bulbs by dipping chilled thermometers into the sample.
The thermometers are then placed in test tubes and heated in a water bath
until the specimens melt and the ﬁrst drop falls from each thermometer
bulb. The average of the temperatures at which these drops fall is the drop
melting point of the sample.
The congealing point of petroleum wax, including petrolatum (ASTM D-
93, IP 76), is determined by dipping a thermometer bulb in the melted wax
and placing it in a heated vial. The thermometer is held horizontally and
slowly rotated on its axis. As long as the wax remains liquid, it will hang
from the bulb as a pendant drop.The temperature at which the drop rotates
with the thermometer is the congealing point. The congealing point of
microcrystalline wax or petrolatum is invariably lower than its correspon-
ding drop melting point.
On the other hand, the solidiﬁcation point of wax is the temperature in
the cooling curve of the wax where the slope of the curve ﬁrst changes sig-
niﬁcantly as the wax sample changes from a liquid to a solid state. In the"
"test method (ASTM D-3944), a sample of wax is placed in a test tube at
ambient temperature and heated above the solidiﬁcation point of the wax
sample. A thermocouple probe, attached to a recorder, is inserted into the
wax sample, which is allowed to cool to room temperature. The thermo-
couple response of the cooling wax traces a curve on the chart paper of the
recorder. The ﬁrst signiﬁcant change in the slope of the curve is the soft-
ening point.
14.3.9. Molecular Weight
The molecular weight of various waxes may differ according to (1) the
source of the wax (whether it originated in lighter- or heavier-grade lubri-
cating oils) and (2) the processing of the wax (the closeness of the distilla-
tion cut or the fractionation by crystallization). Thus the average molecular
weight of a wax may represent an average of a narrow or a wide band of
distribution.
Generally, for any series of similar waxes, an increase in molecular weight
increases viscosity and melting point. However, many of the other physical
and functional properties are more related to the hydrocarbon types and
distribution than to the average molecular weight.
In the test method for molecular weight (ASTM D-2503) a small sample
of wax is dissolved in a suitable solvent, and a droplet of the wax solution
is placed on a thermistor in a closed chamber in close proximity to a sus-
pended drop of the pure solvent on a second thermistor. The difference in
vapor pressure between the two positions results in solvent transport and
condensation onto the wax solution, with a resultant change in tempera-316 waxture. Through suitable calibration, the observed effect can be expressed 
in terms of molecular weight of the wax specimen as a number average
molecular weight.
14.3.10. Odor and Taste
The odor of wax is an important property in some uses of wax such as food
packaging and is often included in the speciﬁcations of petroleum wax.
The odor of petroleum wax (ASTM D-1833, IP 185) is determined by a
method in which 10g of wax is shaved, placed in an odor-free glass bottle,
and capped. After 15 min the sample is evaluated in an odor-free room by
removing the cap and snifﬁng lightly. A rating of 0 (no odor) to 4 (very
strong odor) is given by each member of a chosen panel.The reported value
is the average of the individual ratings.
However, subjective evaluations such as odor and taste are difﬁcult to
standardize because even with a standardized method involving a group 
of experts there may be a difference of opinion as to what constitutes an
acceptable odor or taste. A speciﬁc example is wine tasting.
14.3.11. Oil Content
The oil content of parafﬁn waxes is an indication of the degree of reﬁne-
ment, and fully reﬁned wax usually has an oil content of less than 0.5%.
Wax containing more than this amount of oil is referred to as scale wax ,
although an intermediate grade known as semireﬁned wax is sometimes 
recognized for wax having an oil content of about 1%.
Excess oil tends to exude from parafﬁn wax, giving it a dull appearance
and a greasy feel. Such a wax would obviously be unsuitable for many
applications, particularly the manufacture of food wrappings. A high oil
content tends to plasticize the wax and has an adverse effect on sealing
strength, tensile strength, hardness, odor, taste, color, and particularly color
stability.
During wax reﬁning increasing amounts of oil are removed, and this
process must be controlled.Also, the oil content of slack waxes, petrolatum,
and waxes must be assessed for end user speciﬁcation. For high-oil-content
waxes (i.e., greater than 15% w/w), the method (ASTM D-3235) involves
dissolving a weighed amount of wax in a mixture of methyl ethyl ketone
(MEK) and toluene, followed by cooling to –32°C (–27°F) to precipitate
the wax. The oil and solvent are removed; then the solvent is evaporated
off to produce a weighable amount of oil. Gas-liquid chromatographic
(GLC) analysis of the solvent-extracted material has shown that the deter-
mined oil contains a small amount of additional wax, n-C17to n-C22alkanes,
thereby producing a small error.test methods 317For wax containing less than 15% oil, the method (ASTM D-721, IP 158)
is similar to that for high-oil-content waxes (ASTM D-3235) but uses only
methyl ethyl ketone as the solvent. The concept that the oil is much more
soluble than wax in methyl ethyl ketone at low temperatures is utilized in
this procedure. A weighed sample of wax is dissolved in warm methyl ethyl
ketone in a test tube and chilled to -32°C (-25°F) to precipitate the wax.
The solvent-oil solution is separated from the wax by pressure ﬁltration
through a sintered glass ﬁlter stick. The solvent is evaporated, and the
residue is weighed.
Microcrystalline waxes have a greater afﬁnity for oil than parafﬁn waxes
because of their smaller crystal structure. The permissible amount depends
on the type of wax and its intended use.
The oil content of microcrystalline wax is, in general, much greater than"
"that of parafﬁn wax and could be as high as 20%. Waxes containing more
than 20% oil would usually be classed as petrolatum, but this line of demar-
cation is by no means precise.
14.3.12. Peroxide Content
The deterioration of petroleum wax results in the formation of peroxides
and other oxygen-containing compounds. The test method for determina-
tion of the peroxide number measures those compounds that will oxidize
potassium iodide. Thus the magnitude of the peroxide number is an indi-
cation of the quantity of oxidizing constituents present. In the test method
(ASTM D-1832), a sample is dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and is 
acidiﬁed with acetic acid. A solution of potassium iodide is added, and 
after a reaction period, the solution is titrated with sodium thiosulfate and
a starch indicator.
Suitable antioxidants, such as 2,6-di-tertiary butyl- p-cresol and butylated
hydroxyanisole, may be added to the wax to retard the oxidation reactions.
14.3.13. Slip Properties
Friction is an indication of the resistance to sliding exhibited by two 
surfaces in contact with one another. The intended application determines
the degree of slip desired. Coatings for packages that require stacking
should have a high coefﬁcient of friction to prevent slippage in the stacks.
Folding box coatings should have a low coefﬁcient of friction to allow the
boxes to slide easily from a stack of blanks being fed to the forming and
ﬁlling equipment.
The coefﬁcient of kinetic friction for wax coatings (ASTM D-2534) is
determined by fastening a wax-coated paper to a horizontal plate attached318 waxto the lower, movable cross arm of an electronic load cell-type tensile tester.
A second paper is taped to a 180-g sled that is placed on the ﬁrst sample.
The sled is attached to the load cell by a nylon monoﬁlament passing around
a frictionless pulley. The kinematic coefﬁcient of friction is calculated from
the average force required to move the sled at 35 in./min divided by the
sled weight.
In this same vein, the abrasion resistance of wax is also an important
property and can be determined by a standard test method (ASTM 
D-3234).
14.3.14. Storage Stability
The presence of peroxides or similar oxy-compounds is usually the result
of oxidation and deterioration of waxes either in use or storage. Antioxi-
dants, such as butylated hydroxyanisole, may be used to retard oxidation.
The peroxide number of petroleum wax (ASTM D-1832) is determined
by dissolving a sample in carbon tetrachloride, acidifying with acetic acid,
and adding a solution of potassium iodide; any peroxides present will react
with the potassium iodide to liberate iodine, which is then titrated with
sodium thiosulfate.
14.3.15. Strength
Another popular test for wax is the tensile strength (ASTM D-1320), which
is considered to be a useful guide in controlling the quality of the wax,
although the actual signiﬁcance of the results obtained is not clear.
The method for determining the tensile strength of parafﬁn wax (ASTM
D-1320) is an empirical evaluation of the tensile strength of waxes that do
not elongate more than 1/18th of an inch under the test conditions. Six
dumbbell-shaped specimens, with a speciﬁed cross-sectional area are cast.
The specimens are broken on a testing machine under a load that increases
at the rate of 20 lb/s along the longitudinal axis of the sample. Values are
reported as pounds per square inch.
To determine the modulus of rupture (breaking force in pounds per
square inch) of petroleum wax (ASTM D-2004), a wax slab, 8 ¥4 ¥0.l5 in.,
is cast over hot water. Small strips, about 3 ¥1in., are cut from the center
of the slab. The strips are placed lengthwise on the support beams of the
apparatus, and a breaking beam is placed across the specimen parallel to
the support beams. A steadily increasing load is applied by water delivered
to a bucket suspended from the breaking beam. The modulus of rupture is
calculated from an equation relating the thickness and width of the test
specimen to the total weight required to break it.test methods 31914.3.16. Ultraviolet Absorptivity
For process control purposes, it may be desirable to monitor the total 
aromatic content of petroleum wax (ASTM D-2008).
The procedure tests the product as a whole, without including any sep-
aration or fractionation steps to concentrate the absorptive fractions. When
wax or petrolatum is tested in this procedure, the specimen is dissolved in
iso-octane, and the ultraviolet absorbance is measured at a speciﬁed wave-
length such as 290 nm. The absorptivity is then calculated. This procedure,
as such, is not a part of the federal speciﬁcation.
Although this procedure shows good operator precision, interpretation
of the results requires some caution. Because the test does not include any
selective fractionation of the sample, it does not distinguish any particular
aromatic. It is also subject to the errors arising from interferences or dif-"
"ferences in strong or weak absorptivity shown by different aromatics.There-
fore, the test is good for characterization but cannot be used for quantitative
determination of aromatic content or any other absorptive component.
14.3.17. Viscosity
Viscosity of molten wax (ASTM D-3236) is of importance in applications
involving coating or dipping processes because it inﬂuences the quality of
coating obtained. Examples of such applications are paper converting, hot-
dip anticorrosion coatings, and taper manufacturing.
Parafﬁn waxes do not differ much in viscosity, a typical viscosity being 3
±0.5 cSt at 99°C (210°F). Microcrystalline wax is considerably more viscous
and varies over a wide range, 10–20 cSt at 99°C (210°F). Some hot melt vis-
cosities exceed 20,000 cSt at 177°C (350°F).
Kinematic viscosity is measured by timing the ﬂow of a ﬁxed volume of
material through a calibrated capillary at a selected temperature (ASTM
D-445, IP 71). The unit of kinematic viscosity is the stokes, and kinematic
viscosities of waxes are usually reported in centistokes. Saybolt Universal
seconds can be derived from centistokes (ASTM D-2161):
Saybolt seconds @ 37.8°C (100°F) =cSt ¥4.635
Saybolt seconds @ 98.9°C (210°F) =cSt ¥4.667
Another method (ASTM D-2669) is suitable for blends of wax and addi-
tives with apparent viscosities up to 20,000cP at 177°C (350°F). Apparent
viscosity is the measurement of drag produced on a rotating spindle
immersed in the test liquid. A suitable viscometer is equipped to use inter-
changeable spindles and adjustable rates of rotation. The wax blend is320 waxheated by means of a heating mantle in an 800-ml beaker and continuously
stirred until the test temperature is slightly exceeded. The sample is cooled
to the test temperature, the stirring is discontinued, and the viscosity is
measured. Viscosities over a range of temperatures are recorded and
plotted on semilog paper to determine the apparent viscosity at any tem-
perature in the particular region of interest.
14.3.18. Volatility
The boiling point distribution of parafﬁn wax provides an estimate of
hydrocarbon molecular weight distribution that inﬂuences many of the
physical and functional properties of petroleum wax. To a lesser extent, dis-
tillation characteristics also are inﬂuenced by the distribution of various
molecular types; that is, n-parafﬁns, branched, or cyclic structures. In the
case of the parafﬁn waxes that are predominantly straight chain, the distil-
lation curve reﬂects the molecular size distribution.
In the most common distillation test (ASTM D-1160), fractions are
obtained under reduced pressure such as 10 mm for parafﬁn waxes or at 
1mm for higher-molecular-weight waxes. The fractions are taken at inter-
vals across the full distillable range, and the complete results may be
reported. In some cases, and for brevity, the distillation results are reported
as the temperature difference observed between the 5% off and 95% off
cut points. Waxes having very a narrow width of cut will tend to be more
crystalline and to have higher melting points, higher hardness and tensile
strength properties, and less ﬂexibility.
In the gas chromatographic method (ASTM D 2887), a sample of the test
wax is dissolved in xylene and introduced into a gas chromatographic column
that is programmed to separate the hydrocarbons in boiling point order by
raising the temperature of the column at a reproducible,calibrated rate.When
wax samples are used, the thermal conductivity detector is used to measure
the amount of eluted fraction. The data obtained in this procedure are re-
ported in terms of percentage recovered at certain ﬁxed temperature intervals.

ASPHALT
15.1. INTRODUCTION
Asphalt is a dark brown to black cementitious material obtained from
petroleum processing, which contains very high-molecular-weight molecu-
lar polar species called asphaltenes that are soluble in carbon disulﬁde,
pyridine, aromatic hydrocarbons, and chlorinated hydrocarbons (Gruse 
and Stevens, 1960; Guthrie, 1967; Broome and Wadelin, 1973; Weissermel
and Arpe, 1978; Hoffman, 1983; Austin, 1984; Chenier, 1992; Hoffman and
McKetta, 1993; Speight, 1992; Speight, 2000).
Asphalt derives its characteristics from the nature of its crude oil pre-
cursor, with some variation possible by choice of manufacturing process.
Although there are a number of reﬁneries or reﬁnery units whose prime
function is to produce asphalt, petroleum asphalt is primarily a product of
integrated reﬁnery operations (Fig. 15.1). Crude oil may be selected for
these reﬁneries for a variety of other product requirements, and the asphalt
(or residuum) produced may vary somewhat in characteristics from one
reﬁnery-crude system to another.
The residua from which asphalt are produced were once considered the
garbage of a reﬁnery, have little value and little use other than as a road
oil. In fact, delayed coking (once the so-called the reﬁnery garbage can) 
was developed with the purpose of converting residua to liquids (valuable
products) and coke (fuel). However, recognition that asphalt, a once-
maligned product worth only $16 per ton, is now worth $150–$200 per 
ton has changed attitudes toward residua and asphalt. Detailed speciﬁ-
cations are necessary for asphalt paving uses as well as for other uses of
asphalt.
15.2. PRODUCTION AND PROPERTIES
Residua are the starting materials for asphalt, and therefore the properties
of the asphalt depend on the properties of the residuum from which the
asphalt is manufactured. Residua properties can vary, depending on the cut
point of the residuum (Table 15.1).

Asphalt manufacture involves distilling everything possible from crude
petroleum until a residuum with the desired properties is obtained. This 
is usually done by stages (Fig. 15.2) in which distillation at atmospheric 
pressure removes the lower-boiling fractions and yields an atmospheric
residuum ( reduced crude ) that may contain higher-boiling (lubricating) oils,
wax, and asphalt. Distillation of the reduced crude under vacuum removes
the oils (and wax) as overhead products, and the asphalt remains as a
bottom (or residual) product. The majority of the polar functionalities and
high-molecular-weight species in the original crude oil, which tend to be
nonvolatile, concentrate in the vacuum residuum (Speight, 2000), thereby
conferring desirable or undesirable properties on the asphalt.
At this stage the asphalt is frequently and incorrectly referred to as pitch
and has a softening point (ASTM D-36,ASTM D-61,ASTM D-2319,ASTM
D-3104, ASTM D-3461) related to the amount of oil removed and increas-
ing with increasing overhead removal. In character with the elevation of the
softening point, the pour point is also elevated (Table 15.1): The more oil
distilled from the residue, the higher the softening point.
Asphalt is also produced by propane deasphalting (Fig. 15.3), and there
are differences in the properties of asphalts prepared by propane deas-
phalting and those prepared by vacuum distillation from the same feed-stock. Propane deasphalting also has the ability to reduce a residuum even"
"further and to produce an asphalt product with lower viscosity, higher duc-
tility, and higher temperature susceptibility than other asphalts, although
such properties might be anticipated to be very much crude oil dependent.
Propane deasphalting is conventionally applied to low-asphalt-content326 asphalt
Figure 15.2. The distillation section of a reﬁnery 
Figure 15.3. Propane deasphalting crude oils, which are generally different in type and source from those
processed by distillation of higher-yield crude oils. In addition, the proper-
ties of asphalt can be modiﬁed by air blowing in batch and continuous
processes (Fig. 15.4) (Speight, 1992 and references cited therein; Speight,
2000 and references cited therein). On the other hand, the preparation of
asphalts in liquid form by blending (cutting back) asphalt with a petroleum
distillate fraction is customary and is generally accomplished in tanks
equipped with coils for air agitation or with a mechanical stirrer or a vortex
mixer.
An asphalt emulsion is a mixture of asphalt and an anionic agent such
as the sodium or potassium salt of a fatty acid. The fatty acid is usually a
mixture and may contain palmitic, stearic, linoleic, and abietic acids, and/or
high-molecular-weight phenols. Sodium lignate is often added to alkaline
emulsions to effect better emulsion stability. Nonionic cellulose derivatives
are also used to increase the viscosity of the emulsion if needed. The 
acid number of asphalt is an indicator of its emulsiﬁability and reﬂects the
presence of high-molecular-weight asphaltogenic or naphthenic acids.
Diamines, frequently used as cationic agents, are made from the reaction of
tallow acid amines with acrylonitrile, followed by hydrogenation. The prop-
erties of asphalt emulsions (ASTM D-977, ASTM D-2397) allow a variety
of uses. As with other petroleum products, sampling is an important 
precursor to asphalt analysis and a standard method (ASTM D-140) isproduction and properties 327

semisolid, at point of manufacture, storage, or delivery.
15.3. TEST METHODS
The properties of asphalt are deﬁned by a variety of standard tests that can
be used to deﬁne quality (Table 15.2). Because the properties of residua
vary with cut point (Table 15.1), the volume % of the crude oil helps the
reﬁner produce asphalt of a speciﬁc type or property.
Speciﬁcations for paving asphalt cements usually include ﬁve grades 
differing in either viscosity or penetration level at 60°C (140°F) (ASTM 
D-496). Susceptibility of viscosity to temperature is usually controlled in
asphalt cement by viscosity limits at a higher temperature such as 135°C
(275°F) and a penetration or viscosity limit at a lower temperature such as
25°C (77°F). Paving cutbacks are also graded at 60°C (140°F) by viscosity,
with usually four to ﬁve grades of each type. For asphalt cements, the newer
viscosity grade designation is the midpoint of the viscosity range. The
cutback’s grade designation is the minimum kinematic viscosity for the
grade, with a maximum grade viscosity of twice the minimum.
Rooﬁng and industrial asphalts are also generally speciﬁed in various
grades of hardness, usually with a combination of softening point (ASTM
D-61, ASTM D-2319, ASTM D-3104, ASTM D-3461) and penetration to
distinguish grades (ASTM D-312, ASTM D-449). Temperature susceptibil-
ity is usually controlled in these requirements by specifying penetration
limits or ranges at 25°C (77°F) and other temperatures as well as softening
point ranges at higher temperatures.Asphalt for built-up roof constructions
are differentiated according to application depending primarily on pitch of
the roof and to some extent on whether or not mineral surfacing aggregates
are speciﬁed (ASTM D-312). The damp-prooﬁng grades reﬂect above- or
below-grade construction, primarily, and whether or not a self-healing 
property is incorporated.
The signiﬁcance of a particular test is not always apparent from a reading
of the procedure and sometimes can only be gained through working famil-
iarity with the test. The following tests are commonly used to characterize
asphalts, but these are not the only tests used for determining the property
and behavior of an asphaltic binder. As in the petroleum industry, a variety
of tests are employed that have evolved through local, or company, use.
15.3.1. Acid Number
The acid number is a measure of the acidity of a product and is used as 
a guide in the quality control of asphalt properties. Because a variety of 328 asphalttest methods 329

widely in service properties, the test is not sufﬁciently accurate to predict
the precise behavior of asphalt in service.
Asphalt contains a small amount of organic acids and saponiﬁable mate-
rial that is largely determined by the percentage of naphthenic (cycloparaf-
ﬁnic) acids of higher molecular weight that are originally present in the
crude oil. With increased hardness, asphalt from a particular crude oil 
normally decreases in acid number as more of the naphthenic acids are
removed during the distillation process. Acidic constituents may also be
present as additives or as degradation products formed during service, such
as oxidation products (ASTM D-5770). The relative amount of these mate-
rials can be determined by titrating with bases. The acid number is used as
a guide in the quality control of lubricating oil formulations. It is also some-330 asphalt

demning limits must be empirically established.
In a manner akin to the acid number , the base number (often referred
to as the neutralization number ) is a measure of the basic constituents in
the oil under the conditions of the test. The base number is used as a guide
in the quality control of oil formulation and is also used as a measure of oil
degradation in service. The neutralization number , expressed as the base
number , is a measure of the amount of basic substance in the oil always
under the conditions of the test. The neutralization number is used as a
guide in the quality control of lubricating oil formulations. It is also some-
times used as a measure of lubricant degradation in service; however, any
condemning limits must be empirically established.
The saponiﬁcation number expresses the amount of base that will react
with 1 g of the sample when heated in a speciﬁc manner. Because certain
elements are sometimes added to asphalt and also consume alkali and acids,
the results obtained indicate the effect of these extraneous materials in
addition to the saponiﬁable material present. In the test method (ASTM
D-94, IP 136), a known weight of the sample is dissolved in methyl ethyl
ketone or a mixture of suitable solvents and the mixture is heated with a
known amount of standard alcoholic potassium hydroxide for between"
"30 and 90 min at 80°C (176°F). The excess alkali is titrated with standard
hydrochloric acid, and the saponiﬁcation number is calculated.
15.3.2. Asphaltene Content
The asphaltene fraction (ASTM D-2006, ASTM D-2007, ASTM D-3279,
ASTM D-4124, ASTM D-6560, IP 143) is the highest-molecular-weight,
most complex fraction in petroleum. The asphaltene content gives an indi-
cation of the amount of coke that can be expected during processing
(Speight, 2000; Speight, 2001; Speight and Ozum 2002).
In any of the methods for the determination of the asphaltene content,
the crude oil or product (such as asphalt) is mixed with a large excess
(usually >30 volumes hydrocarbon per volume of sample) of low-boiling
hydrocarbon such as n-pentane or n-heptane. For an extremely viscous
sample, a solvent such as toluene may be used before the addition of the
low-boiling hydrocarbon but an additional amount of the hydrocarbon
(usually >30 volumes hydrocarbon per volume of solvent) must be added
to compensate for the presence of the solvent. After a speciﬁed time, the
insoluble material (the asphaltene fraction) is separated (by ﬁltration)
and dried. The yield is reported as percentage (% w/w) of the original
sample.
It must be recognized that, in any of these tests, different hydrocarbons
(such as n-pentane or n-heptane) will give different yields of the asphal-test methods 331tene fraction and if the presence of the solvent is not compensated by use
of additional hydrocarbon the yield will be erroneous. In addition, if the
hydrocarbon is not present in a large excess, the yields of the asphaltene
fraction will vary and will be erroneous (Speight, 2000).
The precipitation number is often equated to the asphaltene content, but
there are several issues that remain obvious in its rejection for this purpose.
For example, the method to determine the precipitation number (ASTM
D-91) advocates the use of naphtha for use with black oil or lubricating oil
and the amount of insoluble material (as a % v/v of the sample) is the pre-
cipitating number. In the test, 10 ml of sample is mixed with 90 ml of ASTM
precipitation naphtha (which may or may nor have a constant chemical
composition) in a graduated centrifuge cone and centrifuged for 10 min at
600–700 rpm. The volume of material on the bottom of the centrifuge cone
is noted until repeat centrifugation gives a value within 0.1 ml (the precip-
itation number). Obviously, this can be substantially different from the
asphaltene content.
In another test method (ASTM D-4055), pentane-insoluble materials
above 0.8 mm in size can be determined. In the test method, a sample of oil
is mixed with pentane in a volumetric ﬂask, and the oil solution is ﬁltered
through a 0.8- mm membrane ﬁlter. The ﬂask, funnel, and ﬁlter are washed
with pentane to completely transfer the particulates onto the ﬁlter, which
is then dried and weighed to give the yield of pentane-insoluble materials.
Another test method (ASTM D-893) that was originally designed for 
the determination of pentane- and toluene-insoluble materials in used
lubricating oils can also be applied to asphalt. However, the method may
need modiﬁcation by ﬁrst adding a solvent (such as toluene) to the asphalt
before adding pentane. The pentane-insoluble constituents can include oil-
insoluble materials. The toluene-insoluble materials can come from exter-
nal contamination and products from degradation of asphalt. A signiﬁcant
change in the pentane-insoluble constituents or toluene-insoluble constituents
indicates a change in asphalt that could lead to performance problems.
Two test methods are used. Procedure A covers the determination of
insoluble constituents without the use of coagulant in the pentane and pro-
vides an indication of the materials that can be readily separated from the
asphalt-solvent mixture by centrifugation. Procedure B covers the deter-
mination of insoluble constituents in asphalt containing additives and uses
a coagulant. In addition to the materials separated by using procedure A,
this coagulation procedure separates some ﬁnely divided materials that may
be suspended in the asphalt. The results obtained by procedures A and B
should not be compared because they usually give different values. The
same procedure should be applied when comparing results obtained peri-
odically on an oil in use or when comparing results determined in different
laboratories.332 asphaltIn procedure A, a sample is mixed with pentane and centrifuged. The
asphalt solution is decanted, and the precipitate is washed twice with
pentane, dried, and weighed. For toluene-insoluble constituents a separate
sample of the asphalt is mixed with pentane and centrifuged. The precipi-
tate is washed twice with pentane, once with toluene-alcohol solution,
and once with toluene. The insoluble material is then dried and weighed.
In procedure B, procedure A is followed except that instead of pentane, a
pentane-coagulant solution is used.
15.3.3. Bonding and Adhesion"
"The adhesion of asphalt to the mineral aggregate is a fundamental prop-
erty of road asphalt. Once the adhesion deteriorates, the surface becomes
unstable and unusable. There is a test method (ASTM D-1191) designed
for use on crack and joint sealers that is used primarily to determine
whether a jointing material possesses an arbitrary amount of bonding
strength at low temperatures where portland cement concrete is being
used.
15.3.4. Breaking Point (Fraas)
Brittle asphalt causes pavement instability. One particular test method 
(IP 80) is an approximate indication of the temperature at which asphalt
possesses no ductility and would reﬂect brittle fracture conditions.
15.3.5. Carbon Disulﬁde-Insoluble Constituents
The component of highest carbon content is the fraction termed carboids,
which consists of species that are insoluble in carbon disulﬁde or in pyri-
dine. The fraction that has been called carbenes contains molecular species
that are soluble in carbon disulﬁde and soluble in pyridine but are insolu-
ble in toluene (Fig. 15.5).
Asphalt is a hydrocarbonaceous material that is made of constituents
(containing carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur) that are com-
pletely soluble in carbon disulﬁde (ASTM D-4). Trichloroethylene and
1,1,1-trichloroethane have been used in recent years as solvents for the
determination of asphalt solubility (ASTM D-2042).
The carbene and carboid fractions are generated by thermal degrada-
tion or by oxidative degradation and are not considered to be naturally
occurring constituents of asphalt. The test method for determining the
toluene-insoluble constituents of tar and pitch (ASTM D-4072, ASTM 
D-4312) can be used to determine the amount of carbenes and carboids
in asphalt.test methods 33315.3.6. Carbon Residue
The carbon residue of asphalt serves as an indication of the propensity of
the sample to form carbonaceous deposits (thermal coke) under the inﬂu-
ence of heat. The residue produced is also often used to provide thermal
data that give an indication of the composition of the asphalt (Speight, 2000;
Speight, 2001).
Tests for the Conradson carbon residue (ASTM D-189, IP 13), the 
Ramsbottom carbon residue (ASTM D-524, IP 14), the microcarbon carbon
residue (ASTM D-4530, IP 398), and asphaltene content (ASTM D-2006,
ASTM D-2007, ASTM D-3279, ASTM D-4124, ASTM D-6560, IP 143) are
sometimes included in inspection data on petroleum. The data give an 
indication of the amount of coke that will be formed during thermal
processes as well as an indication of the amount of high-boiling constituents
in petroleum.
The determination of the carbon residue of petroleum or a petroleum
product is applicable to relatively nonvolatile samples that decompose on
distillation at atmospheric pressure. Samples that contain ash-forming con-
stituents will have an erroneously high carbon residue, depending on the
amount of ash formed. All three methods are applicable to relatively non-
volatile petroleum products that partially decompose on distillation at
atmospheric pressure. Crude oils having a low carbon residue may be dis-334 asphalt
Figure 15.5. Feedstock fractionation tilled to a speciﬁed residue and the carbon residue test of choice then
applied to the residue.
In the Conradson carbon residue test (ASTM D-189, IP 13), a weighed
quantity of sample is placed in a crucible and subjected to destructive dis-
tillation for a ﬁxed period of severe heating. At the end of the speciﬁed
heating period, the test crucible containing the carbonaceous residue is
cooled in a desiccator and weighed and the residue is reported as a per-
centage (% w/w) of the original sample (Conradson carbon residue).
In the Ramsbottom carbon residue test (ASTM D-524, IP 14), the
sample is weighed into a glass bulb that has a capillary opening and is placed
into a furnace (at 550°C/1022°F). The volatile matter is distilled from the
bulb, and the nonvolatile matter that remains in the bulb cracks to form
thermal coke. After a speciﬁed heating period, the bulb is removed from
the bath, cooled in a desiccator, and weighed to report the residue (Rams-
bottom carbon residue) as a percentage (% w/w) of the original sample.
In the microcarbon residue test (ASTM D4530, IP 398), a weighed quan-
tity of the sample placed in a glass vial is heated to 500°C (932°F) under an
inert (nitrogen) atmosphere in a controlled manner for a speciﬁc time 
and the carbonaceous residue [ carbon residue (micro) ] is reported as a 
percentage (% w/w) of the original sample.
The data produced by the microcarbon test (ASTM D-4530, IP 398) are
equivalent to those produced by the Conradson carbon method (ASTM D-
189, IP 13). However, the microcarbon test method offers better control of
test conditions and requires a smaller sample. Up to 12 samples can be run
simultaneously. This test method is applicable to petroleum and to petro-
leum products that partially decompose on distillation at atmospheric pres-"
"sure and is applicable to a variety of samples that generate a range of yields
(0.01% w/w to 30% w/w) of thermal coke.
Other test methods that are used for determining the coking value of
tar and pitch (ASTM D-2416, ASTM D-4715), which indicates the rela-
tive coke-forming properties of tars and pitches, might also be applied to
asphalt. Both test methods are applicable to tar and pitch with an ash
content ≤0.5% (ASTM D-2415). The former test method (ASTM D-2416)
gives results close to those obtained by the Conradson carbon residue
test (ASTM D-189, IP 13). However, in the latter test method (ASTM
D-4715), a sample is heated for a speciﬁed time at 550 ± 10°C (1022 ±
18°F) in an electric furnace. The percentage of residue is reported as the
coking value.
Finally, a method that is used to determine pitch volatility (ASTM 
D-4893) might also be used, on occasion, to determine the nonvolatility of
asphalt. In the method, an aluminum dish containing about 15 g of accu-
rately weighed sample is introduced into the cavity of a metal block heated
and maintained at 350°C (662°F). After 30 min, during which any volatilestest methods 335are swept away from the surface of the sample by preheated nitrogen, the
residual sample is taken out and allowed to cool down in the desiccator.
Nonvolatility is determined by the sample weight remaining and reported
as percentage w/w residue.
In any of the above tests, ash-forming constituents (ASTM D-482) or
nonvolatile additives present in the sample will be included in the total
carbon residue reported ,leading to higher carbon residue values and erro-
neous conclusions about the coke-forming propensity of the sample.
15.3.7. Compatibility
When a coating asphalt and a saturating-grade asphalt are used together,
as in prepared rooﬁng, one test method (ASTM D-1370) indicates whether
they are likely to bleed, show strike-through, or disbond under stress at the
coating felt interface.
15.3.8. Composition
Determination of the composition of asphalt has always presented a chal-
lenge because of the complexity and high molecular weights of the molec-
ular constituents. The principle behind composition studies is to evaluate
asphalts in terms of composition and performance.
The methods used can be conveniently arranged into a number of cate-
gories: (a) fractionation by precipitation; (b) fractionation by distillation;
(c) separation by chromatographic techniques; (d) chemical analysis by
spectrophotometric techniques (infrared, ultraviolet, nuclear magnetic
resource, X-ray ﬂuorescence, emission, neutron activation), titrimetric and
gravimetric techniques, and elemental analysis; and (e) molecular weight
analysis by mass spectrometry, vapor pressure osmometry, and size exclu-
sion chromatography.
However, fractional separation has been the basis for most asphalt
composition analysis (Fig. 15.5). The separation methods that have been
used divide asphalt into operationally deﬁned fractions. Three types of
asphalt separation procedures are now in use: (a) chemical precipitation
in which n-pentane separation of asphaltenes is followed by chemical pre-
cipitation of other fractions with sulfuric acid of increasing concentration
(ASTM D-2006); (b) adsorption chromatography with a clay-gel proce-
dure in which, after removal of the asphaltenes, the remaining constituents
are separated by selective adsorption/desorption on an adsorbent (ASTM
D-2007 and ASTM D-4124); and (c) size exclusion chromatography in
which gel permeation chromatographic (GPC) separation of asphalt con-
stituents occurs based on their associated sizes in dilute solutions (ASTM
D-3593).336 asphaltThe fractions obtained in these schemes are deﬁned operationally or 
procedurally. The amount and type of asphaltenes in an asphalt are, for
instance, deﬁned by the solvent used for precipitating them. Fractional sep-
aration of asphalt does not provide well-deﬁned chemical components. The
materials separated should only be deﬁned in terms of the particular test
procedure (Fig. 15.5). However, these fractions are generated by thermal
degradation or by oxidative degradation and are not considered to be nat-
urally occurring constituents of asphalt. The test method for determining
the toluene-insoluble constituents of tar and pitch (ASTM D-4072, ASTM
D-4312) can be used to determine the amount of carbenes and carboids in
asphalt.
In these methods, a sample is digested at 95°C (203°F) for 25 min and
then extracted with hot toluene in an alundum thimble. The extraction time
is 18 h (ASTM D-4072) or 3 h (ASTM D-4312). The insoluble matter is 
dried and weighed. Combustion will then show whether the material is truly
carbonaceous or is inorganic ash from the metallic constituents (ASTM D-
482, ASTM D-2415, ASTM D-4628, ASTM D-4927, ASTM D-5185, ASTM
D-6443, IP 4).
Another method (ASTM D-893) covers the determination of pentane-
and toluene-insoluble constituents in used lubricating oils and can be"
"applied to asphalt. Pentane-insoluble constituents include oil-insoluble
materials, and toluene-insoluble constituents can come from external con-
tamination and highly carbonized materials from degradation. A signiﬁcant
change in pentane- or toluene =insoluble constituents indicates a change in
asphalt properties that could lead to problems in service.The insoluble con-
stituents measured can also assist in evaluating the performance charac-
teristics of asphalt.
Two test methods are used: Procedure A covers the determination of
insoluble constituents without the use of coagulant in the pentane and pro-
vides an indication of the materials that can be readily separated from the
diluted asphalt by centrifugation. Procedure B covers the determination 
of insoluble constituents in asphalt that contains additives and uses a coa-
gulant. In addition to the materials separated by using procedure A, this
coagulation procedure separates some ﬁnely divided materials that may 
be suspended in the asphalt. The results obtained by procedures A and B
should not be compared because they usually give different values. The
same procedure should be applied when comparing results obtained peri-
odically on asphalt in use or when comparing results determined in differ-
ent laboratories.
In procedure A, a sample is mixed with pentane and centrifuged, after
which the asphalt solution is decanted and the precipitate is washed twice
with pentane, dried, and weighed. For toluene-insoluble constituents, a sep-
arate sample of the asphalt is mixed with pentane and centrifuged. The pre-test methods 337cipitate is washed twice with pentane, once with toluene-alcohol solution,
and once with toluene. The insoluble material is then dried and weighed.
In procedure B, procedure A is followed except that instead of pentane, a
pentane-coagulant solution is used.
Many investigations of relationships between composition and proper-
ties take into account only the concentration of the asphaltenes, independ-
ent of any quality criterion. However, a distinction should be made between
the asphaltenes that occur in straight-run asphalts and those that occur in
blown asphalts. Because asphaltenes are a solubility class rather than a dis-
tinct chemical class vast differences occur in the makeup of this fraction
when it is produced by different processes.
Finally, composition data should always be applied to in-service per-
formance to properly evaluate the behavior of the asphaltic binder under
true working conditions.
15.3.9. Density (Speciﬁc Gravity)
For clariﬁcation, it is necessary to understand the basic deﬁnitions that are
used: (1) density is the mass of liquid per unit volume at 15.6°C (60°F); (2)
relative density is the ratio of the mass of a given volume of liquid at 15.6°C
(60°F) to the mass of an equal volume of pure water at the same temper-
ature; and (3) speciﬁc gravity is the same as relative density, and the terms
are used interchangeably.
Density (ASTM D-1298, IP 160) is an important property of petroleum
products because petroleum and especially petroleum products are usually
bought and sold on that basis or, if on a volume basis, then converted to a
mass basis via density measurements.This property is almost synonymously
termed as density, relative density, gravity, and speciﬁc gravity, all terms
related to each other. Usually a hydrometer, pycnometer, or more modern
digital density meter is used for the determination of density or speciﬁc
gravity.
In the most commonly used method (ASTM D-1298, IP 160), the sample
is brought to the prescribed temperature and transferred to a cylinder at
approximately the same temperature. The appropriate hydrometer is
lowered into the sample and allowed to settle, and, after temperature equi-
librium has been reached, the hydrometer scale is read and the tempera-
ture of the sample is noted.
Although there are many methods for the determination of density
because of the different nature of petroleum itself and the different prod-
ucts, one test method (ASTM D-5002) is used for the determination of the
density or relative density of petroleum that can be handled in a normal
fashion as a liquid at test temperatures between 15 and 35°C (59–95°F).
This test method applies to petroleum oils with high vapor pressures pro-338 asphaltvided that appropriate precautions are taken to prevent vapor loss during
transfer of the sample to the density analyzer. In the method, approximately
0.7 ml of crude oil sample is introduced into an oscillating sample tube and
the change in oscillating frequency caused by the change in mass of the tube
is used in conjunction with calibration data to determine the density of the
sample.
Another test determines density and speciﬁc gravity by means of a
digital densimeter (ASTM D-4052, IP 365). In the test, a small volume
(approximately 0.7 ml) of liquid sample is introduced into an oscillating
sample tube and the change in oscillating frequency caused by the change"
"in the mass of the tube is used in conjunction with calibration data to
determine the density of the sample. The test is usually applied to petro-
leum, petroleum distillates, and petroleum products that are liquids at tem-
peratures between 15 and 35°C (59–95°F) that have vapor pressures below
600 mmHg and viscosities below about 15,000cSt at the temperature of
test. However, the method should not be applied to samples so dark in
color that the absence of air bubbles in the sample cell cannot be estab-
lished with certainty.
Accurate determination of the density or speciﬁc gravity of crude oil is
necessary for the conversion of measured volumes to volumes at the stan-
dard temperature of 15.56°C (60°F) (ASTM D-1250, IP 200, petroleum
measurement tables). The speciﬁc gravity is also a factor reﬂecting the
quality of crude oils.
The accurate determination of the API gravity of petroleum and its prod-
ucts (ASTM D-287) is also necessary for the conversion of measured
volumes to volumes at the standard temperature of 60°F (15.56°C). Gravity
is a factor governing the quality of crude oils. However, the gravity of a
petroleum product is an uncertain indication of its quality. Correlated with
other properties, gravity can be used to give approximate hydrocarbon com-
position and heat of combustion. This is usually accomplished though use
of API gravity, which is derived from the speciﬁc gravity
API gravity, deg =(141.5/sp gr 60/60°F) – 131.5
and is also a critical measure for reﬂecting the quality of petroleum.
API gravity, or density or relative density, can be determined using one
of two hydrometer methods (ASTM D-287, ASTM D-1298). The use of a
digital analyzer (ASTM D-5002) is ﬁnding increasing popularity for the
measurement of density and speciﬁc gravity.
In the method (ASTM D-287), the API gravity is determined by using a
glass hydrometer for petroleum and petroleum products that are normally
handled as liquids and have a Reid vapor pressure of 26psi (180kPa) or
less. The API gravity is determined at 15.6°C (60°F), or converted to valuestest methods 339at 60°F, by means of standard tables.These tables are not applicable to non-
hydrocarbons or essentially pure hydrocarbons such as the aromatics.
This test method is based on the principle that the gravity of a liquid
varies directly with the depth of immersion of a body ﬂoating in it. The API
gravity is determined with an hydrometer by observing the freely ﬂoating
API hydrometer and noting the graduation nearest to the apparent inter-
section of the horizontal plane surface of the liquid with the vertical scale
of the hydrometer after temperature equilibrium has been reached. The
temperature of the sample is determined with a standard test thermometer
that is immersed in the sample or with the thermometer that is an integral
part of the hydrometer (thermohydrometer).
For solid and semisolid asphalt a pycnometer is generally used (ASTM
D-70), and a hydrometer is applicable to liquid asphalt (ASTM D-3142).
15.3.10. Distillation
Asphalt is prepared from a distillation residuum, and therefore the need
for distillation data is limited.Vacuum distillation data (ASTM D-1160) will
be valuable for composition purposes if the asphalt is prepared from an
atmospheric residuum. Approximate amounts of volatile constituents can
also be determined by test methods developed for other products (ASTM
D-20, ASTM D-402, ASTM D-3607, ASTM D-4893) but that are particu-
larly applicable to cutback asphalt.
Asphalt can also be examined for evaporative losses with a test method
designed for grease (ASTM D-2595) or for engine oil (ASTM D-5480,
ASTM D-5800, ASTM D-6375I, P 421). In another test method (ASTM D-
972), the evaporative losses at any temperature in the range of l00–150°C
(210–300°F) can be determined. A weighed sample is placed in an evapora-
tion cell in an oil bath at the desired test temperature. Heated air at a spec-
iﬁed ﬂow rate is passed over the sample surface for 22 h, after which, the loss
in sample mass is determined. In yet another method (ASTM D-2595),
which is used to supplement the original method (ASTM D-972), the loss of
volatile materials from a grease over a temperature range of 93–316°C
(200–600°F) can be determined. This test uses an aluminum block heater,
instead of an oil bath (ASTM D-972) to achieve higher temperatures.
Another test (ASTM D-6) allows the determination of the percent loss
of mass when a weighed quantity of water-free material is heated in moving
air for 5 h at 163°C (325°F). In this test method a gravity convection oven
with a rotating shelf is used, and the method provides only a relative meas-
urement of the volatility of a material under test conditions. It may be
required for bituminous coating to be applied to galvanized, corrugated,
culvert tube. A test for the loss of heating from a thin ﬁlm is also available
(ASTM D-1754).340 asphalt15.3.11. Ductility"
"The ductility of asphalt is a measure of the ﬂexibility of the asphalt and is
expressed as the distance in centimeters that a standard briquette can be
elongated before breaking (ASTM D-113, IP 32). Ductility is a combina-
tion of ﬂow properties and reﬂects homogeneity, cohesion, and shear sus-
ceptibility; it is an indication of fatigue life and cracking.
15.3.12. Durability 
The durability of asphalt is an indication of the presence of the necessary
chemical and physical properties required for the speciﬁed pavement per-
formance. The property indicates the resistance of the asphalt to change
during the in-service conditions that are prevalent during the life of the
pavement. The durability is determined in terms of resistance to oxidation
(resistance to weathering) and water resistance (ASTM D-529, ASTM D-
1669, ASTM D-1670, ASTM E-42).
15.3.13. Elemental Analysis 
Asphalt is not composed of a single chemical species but is rather a complex
mixture of organic molecules that vary widely in composition and are 
composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur as well as trace
amounts of metals, principally vanadium and nickel. The heteroatoms,
although a minor component compared with the hydrocarbon moiety, can
vary in concentration over a wide range depending on the source of the
asphalt and can be a major inﬂuence on asphalt properties.
Generally, most asphalt is 79–88% w/w carbon, 7–13% w/w hydrogen,
trace–8% w/w sulfur, 2–8% w/w oxygen, and trace–3% w/w nitrogen. Trace
metals such as iron, nickel, vanadium, calcium, titanium, magnesium,
sodium, cobalt, copper, tin, and zinc occur in crude oils. Vanadium and
nickel are bound in organic complexes and, by virtue of the concentration
(distillation) process by which asphalt is manufactured, are also found in
asphalt. The catalytic behavior of vanadium has prompted studies of the
relation between vanadium content and an asphalt’s sensitivity to oxidation
(viscosity ratio).The signiﬁcance of metals in the behavior of asphalts is not
yet well understood or deﬁned.
Thus elemental analysis is still of considerable value to determine the
amounts of elements in asphalt, and the method chosen for the analysis may
be subject to the peculiarities or character of the feedstock under investi-
gation and should be assessed in terms of accuracy and reproducibility. The
methods that are designated for elemental analysis are:test methods 3411.Carbon and hydrogen content (ASTM D-1018, ASTM D-3178, ASTM
D-3343, ASTM D-3701, ASTM D-5291, ASTM E-777, IP 338);
2.Nitrogen content (ASTM D-3179, ASTM D-3228, ASTM D-3431,
ASTM E-148, ASTM E-258, ASTM D-5291, and ASTM E-778);
3.Oxygen content (ASTM E-385); and 
4.Sulfur content (ASTM D-124, ASTM D-129, ASTM D-139, ASTM D-
1266, ASTM D-1552, ASTM D-1757, ASTM D-2622, ASTM D-2785,
ASTM D-3120,ASTM D-3177,ASTM D-4045,ASTM D-4294,ASTM
E-443, IP 30, IP 61, IP 103, IP 104, IP 107, IP 154, IP 243).
The determination of nitrogen has been performed regularly by the 
Kjeldahl method (ASTM D-3228), the Dumas method, and the micro-
coulometric method (ASTM D-3431). The chemiluminescence method is
the most recent technique applied to nitrogen analysis for petroleum. The
chemiluminescence method determines the amount of chemically bound
nitrogen in liquid hydrocarbon samples. In this method, the samples are
introduced to the oxygen-rich atmosphere of a pyrolysis tube maintained
at 975°C (1785°F). Nitrogen in the sample is converted to nitric oxide during
combustion, and the combustion products are dried by passage through
magnesium perchlorate [Mg(ClO 4)2] before entering the reaction chamber
of a chemiluminescence detector.
Oxygen is one of the ﬁve (C, H, N, O, and S) major elements in asphalt,
and although the level rarely exceeds 1.5 % by weight, it may still be criti-
cal to performance. Many petroleum products do not specify a particular
oxygen content, but if the oxygen compounds are present as acidic com-
pounds such as phenols (Ar-OH) and naphthenic acids (cycloalkyl-
COOH), they are controlled in different speciﬁcations by a variety of tests.
15.3.14. Emulsiﬁed Asphalt
There is a standard test method (ASTM D-244) that covers a variety of
tests for the composition, handling, nature and classiﬁcation, storage, use,
and specifying of asphalt emulsions used primarily for paving purposes.
15.3.15. Flash Point
The ﬂash point is the lowest temperature at which application of a test ﬂame
causes the vapor of a sample to ignite under speciﬁed test conditions. The
ﬂash point measures the tendency of a sample to form a ﬂammable mixture
with air under controlled laboratory conditions. Flash point data are used
in shipping and safety regulations to deﬁne ﬂammable and combustible
materials as well as to indicate the possible presence of highly volatile and342 asphaltﬂammable material in a relatively nonvolatile or nonﬂammable material.
The ﬂash point should not be confused with auto-ignition temperature"
"(ASTM E-659), which measures spontaneous combustion with no external
source of ignition.
The Pensky–Martens closed tester (ASTM D-93, IP 34) and the tag
closed tester (ASTM D-56) are normally used for determining the ﬂash
point of fuel oil and similar products. The Cleveland open cup method
(ASTM D-92) is most commonly used, although the Tag open cup (ASTM
D-3143) is applicable to cutback asphalt. As noted above, the ﬂash point
of asphalt is an indication of ﬁre hazard and is frequently used to indi-
cate whether asphalt has been contaminated with materials of lower ﬂash
point.
15.3.16. Float Test
The ﬂoat test is used to determine the consistency of asphalt at as speciﬁed
temperature.
One test method (ASTM D-139) is normally used for asphalt that is too
soft for the penetration test (ASTM D-5, ASTM D-217, ASTM D-937,
ASTM D-1403, IP 50, IP 179, IP 310).
15.3.17. Molecular Weight 
The molecular weight of asphalt is not always (in fact, rarely) used in spec-
iﬁcations. Nevertheless, there may be occasions when the molecular weight
of asphalt is desired, hence the need to reference the various methods here.
Currently, of the methods available, several standard methods are 
recognized as being useful for determination of the molecular weight of
petroleum fractions; these methods are:
ASTM D-2224: Test Method for Mean Molecular Weight of Mineral
Insulating Oils by the Cryoscopic Method (discontinued in 1989 but
still used by some laboratories for determining the molecular weight
of petroleum fractions up to and including gas oil).
ASTM D-2502: Test Method for Estimation of Molecular Weight 
(Relative Molecular Mass) of Petroleum Oils from Viscosity 
Measurements.
ASTM D-2503: Test Method for Estimation of Molecular Weight (Rela-
tive Molecular Mass) of Hydrocarbons by Thermoelectric Measure-
ment of Vapor Pressure.
ASTM D-2878: Method for Estimating Apparent Vapor Pressures and
Molecular Weights of Lubricating Oils.test methods 343ASTM D-3593: Test Method for Molecular Weight Averages/Distribu-
tion of Certain Polymers by Liquid Size Exclusion (Gel Permeation)
Chromatography—GPC Using Universal Calibration (has also been
adapted to the investigation of molecular weight distribution in petro-
leum fractions).
Each method has proponents and opponents because of assumptions made
in the use of the method or because of the mere complexity of the sample
and the nature of the inter- and intramolecular interactions. Before appli-
cation of any one or more of these methods, consideration must be given
to the mechanics of the method and the desired end result.
Methods for molecular weight measurement are also included in other
more comprehensive standards (ASTM D-128,ASTM D-3712), and several
indirect methods have been proposed for the estimation of molecular
weight by correlation with other, more readily measured physical proper-
ties (Speight, 2000, 2001). They are satisfactory when dealing with the con-
ventional type of crude oils or their fractions and products and when
approximate values are desired.
The molecular weights of the individual fractions of asphalt have
received more attention, and have been considered to be of greater impor-
tance, than the molecular weight of the asphalt itself (Speight, 2000, 2001).
The components that make up the asphalt inﬂuence the properties of the
material to an extent that is dependent on the relative amount of the com-
ponent, the molecular structure of the component, and the physical struc-
ture of the component, which includes the molecular weight.
Asphaltenes have a wide range of molecular weights, from 500 to at least
2500, depending upon the method (Speight, 1994). Asphaltenes associate in
dilute solution in nonpolar solvents, giving higher molecular weights than
is actually the case on an individual molecule basis. The molecular weights
of the resins are somewhat lower than those of the asphaltenes and usually
fall within the range 500–1000. This is due not only to the absence of asso-
ciation but also to a lower absolute molecular size. The molecular weights
of the oil fractions (i.e., the asphalt minus the asphaltenes and minus the
resins) is usually less than 500, often 300–400.
15.3.18. Penetration
The penetration test provides one measure of the consistency and hardness
of asphalt.
Several test methods are available for products such as grease (ASTM
D-217,ASTM D-1403, IP 50, IP 310) and petrolatum (ASTM D-937, IP 179)
that might be modiﬁed for asphalt. The more usual test for asphalt (ASTM
D-5, IP 49) is a commonly used consistency test. It involves the determina-344 asphalttion of the extent to which a standard needle penetrates a properly pre-
pared sample of asphalt under deﬁnitely speciﬁed conditions of tempera-
ture, load, and time (100-g load, 5s).The distance that the needle penetrates
in units of mm/10 measured from 0 to 300, is the penetration value. Soft
asphalt has a high penetration value, and the converse is true for hard
asphalt.
15.3.19. Rheology"
"Asphalt is a viscoelastic material whose rheological properties reﬂect crude
type and, to a lesser extent, processing. The ability of asphalt to perform
under many conditions depends on ﬂow behavior. Asphalt ﬁlms or coatings
showing no appreciable change from original conditions are usually desired,
that is, they should allow some structural movement without permanent
deformation.
The viscosity of hydrocarbons and temperature are related by the
Walther equation:
log log (100 ho) =a– mlog T
where hois the limiting viscosity at low shear rates (ASTM D-5018), T is the
absolute temperature, and aand mare constants reﬂecting the intercept
level and slope (or measure of susceptibility of viscosity to temperature,
respectively). On the other hand, the general relationship for viscosity, tem-
perature, and shear rate is:
log log 100 ho(1 ¥CDN) =a– mlog T
where D is shear rate; C is a function of limiting viscosity, limiting slope,
and other constants; and N is the limiting slope.
Typical proﬁles for the different general families of asphalts include cut-
backs or liquid materials, paving asphalt cements and the harder rooﬁng
and industrial materials that are usually graded by softening point. At
lower temperatures (60°C/140°F and lower) and/or higher shear rates,
which are typical of asphalt service conditions after incorporation in a roof
or pavement, semisolid and solid asphalts display an increasing elastic
component that relates viscosity with shear rate. The constant high vis-
cosity level at lower shear rates is the limiting viscosity. Viscosities in the
area where viscosity changes with shear rate are generally termed appar-
ent viscosities.
A number of viscometers have been developed for securing viscosity
data at temperatures as low as 0°C (32°F). The most popular instruments
in current use are the cone plate (ASTM D-3205), parallel plate, and cap-test methods 345illary instruments (ASTM D-2170, ASTM D-2171). The cone plate can be
used for the determination of viscosities in the range of 10 to >109Pa at
temperatures of 0–70°C (32–158°F) and at shear rates from 10–3to 102s–1.
Capillary viscometers are commonly used for the determination of viscosi-
ties at 60–135°C (140–275°F).
Tests recently developed for measurement of viscoelastic properties are
directly usable in engineering relations. Properties can be related to the
inherent structure of bituminous materials. The fraction of highest molec-
ular weight, the asphaltenes, is dispersed within the asphalt and is depend-
ent on the content and nature of the resin and oil fractions. Higher
aromaticity of the oil fractions or higher temperatures leads to viscous (sol)
conditions. A more elastic (gel) condition results from a more parafﬁnic
nature and is indicated by large elastic moduli or, empirically, by a relatively
high penetration at a given softening point. Empirically, the penetration
index (PI) and penetration temperature susceptibility (PTS) have been
used to measure the degree of dispersion.
Asphalt develops an internal structure with age, steric hardening,
in which viscosity can increase on aging without any loss of volatile material.
Those with a particularly high degree of gel structure exhibit thixotropy.
15.3.20. Softening Point
The softening point of asphalt may be deﬁned as that temperature at which
asphalt attains a particular degree of softness under speciﬁed conditions of test.
Asphalt does not go through a solid-liquid phase change when heated
and therefore does not have true melting point. As the temperature is
raised, asphalt gradually softens or becomes less viscous. For this reason,
the determination of the softening point must be made by an arbitrary but
closely deﬁned method if the test values are to be reproducible. Softening
point determination is useful in determining the consistency as one element
in establishing the uniformity of shipments or sources of supply.
Several tests are available to determine the softening point of asphalt
(ASTM D-36, ASTM D-61, ASTM D-2319, ASTM D-3104, ASTM D-3461,
IP 58). In the test method (ASTM D-36, IP 58), a steel ball of speciﬁed
weight is laid on a layer of sample contained in a ring of speciﬁed dimen-
sions. The softening point is the temperature, during heating under speci-
ﬁed conditions, at which the asphalt surrounding the ball deforms and
contacts a base plate.
15.3.21. Stain
The stain index is a measure of the sweating tendency of asphalt and its
homogeneity.346 asphaltThe test is used for oxidized asphalt. The test method (ASTM D-1328)
is used to measure the amount of stain on paper or other cellulosic mate-
rials by asphalt. Variations of the cigarette paper stain procedure include
the Barber stain; talc stain tests are also used.
15.3.22. Temperature-Volume Correction 
Tables are provided (ASTM D-1250) to allow the conversion of volumes
of asphaltic materials from one temperature to another or, as generally
used, to adjust volumes to a temperature of 15.6°C (60°F). The value com-"
"monly taken for mean coefﬁcient of expansion is 0.00036 in the range
15.6–121.1°C (60–250°F).
15.3.23. Thin Film Oven Test
The standard rolling thin ﬁlm oven test (RTFOT) (ASTM D-2872) is used
to simulate the short-term aging of the binders during the hot-mixing
process and has the purpose of determining the hardening effect of heat
and air on a static ﬁlm of asphalt when exposed in a thin ﬁlm. The proce-
dure utilizes a moving ﬁlm exposed for 75 min at 163°C (325°F).
15.3.24. Viscosity
The viscosity of asphalt is a measure of its ﬂow characteristics. It is gener-
ally the most important controlling property for manufacture and for selec-
tion to meet a particular application.
A number of instruments are in common use with asphalt for this
purpose. The vacuum capillary (ASTM D-2171) is commonly used to clas-
sify paving asphalt at 60°C (140°F). Kinematic capillary instruments
(ASTM D-2170, ASTM D-4402) are commonly used in the 60–135°C
(140–275°F) temperature range for both liquid and semisolid asphalts 
in the range of 30–100,000 cSt. Saybolt tests (ASTM D-88) are also used 
in this temperature range and at higher temperatures (ASTM E-102).
At lower temperatures the cone and plate instrument (ASTM D-3205) 
has been used extensively in the viscosity range 1,000–1,000,000 P . Other
techniques include use of the sliding plate microviscometer and the 
rheogoniometer.
15.3.25. Water Content
The presence of water in asphalt can seriously affect performance insofar
as it can effect asphalt-aggregate interactions and asphalt adsorption
(ASTM D-4469). The water content of asphalt can be determined by a testtest methods 347method (ASTM D-95, IP 74) that uses distillation equipment ﬁtted with a
Dean and Stark receiver.
In the test, the sample is heated under reﬂux with a water-immiscible
solvent, which codistills with the water in the sample. Condensed solvent
and water are continuously separated in a trap, the water settling in the
graduated section of the trap and the solvent returning to the still.
15.3.26. Weathering
This test (ASTM D-529) evaluates the relative weather resistance of
asphalts used for protective coating applications, especially for rooﬁng. No
direct measure of outdoor life or service can be obtained from this test.
Methods for preparing test panels (ASTM D-1669) and failure end point
testing (ASTM D-1670) are available.

COKE
16.1. INTRODUCTION
Coke is a gray to black solid carbonaceous residue that is produced from
petroleum during thermal processing; characterized by having a high
carbon content (95% +by weight) and a honeycomb type of appearance,"
"and insoluble in organic solvents. (ASTM D-121) (Chapter 2) (Gruse and
Stevens, 1960; Guthrie, 1967; Weissermel and Arpe, 1978; Hoffman, 1983;
Austin, 1984; Chenier, 1992; Hoffman and McKetta, 1993; Speight, 2000;
Speight and Ozum, 2002).
Coke consists mainly of carbon (90–95%) and has a low mineral matter
content (determined as ash residue). Coke is used as a feedstock in coke
ovens for the steel industry, for heating purposes, for electrode manufac-
ture, and for production of chemicals. The two most important categories
are green coke and calcinated coke . This latter category also includes 
catalyst coke deposited on the catalyst during reﬁning processes; this coke
is not recoverable and is usually burned as reﬁnery fuel.
16.2. PRODUCTION AND PROPERTIES
Petroleum coke is the residue left by the destructive distillation of petro-
leum residua. That formed in catalytic cracking operations is usually non-
recoverable, as it is often employed as fuel for the process.
Delayed coke (Table 16.1) is produced during the delayed coking
process—a batch process—from vacuum residua (Chapter 2) (Speight and
Ozum, 2002). The carbonization (thermal decomposition) reactions involve
dehydrogenation, rearrangement, and condensation. Two of the common
feedstocks are vacuum residues and aromatic oils.
In the delayed coker the feed enters the bottom of the fractionator,
where it mixes with recycled liquid condensed from the coke drum efﬂu-
ent. It is then pumped through the coking heater to one of two coke drums
through a switch valve. It is at 480–500°C. Cracking and polymerization take
place in the coke drum in a nominal 24-h period. Coking is a batch opera-
tion carried out in two coke drums. Coking takes place in one drum in 
35124 h while decoking is carried out in the other drum. A complete cycle is
48 h. Coke is cut from the drum with high-pressure water. Large drums are
27 ft in diameter and 114 ft ﬂange to ﬂange.
Fluid coke (Table 16.2) is produced during the ﬂuid coking process—a
continuous process in which heated coker feeds are sprayed into a ﬂuidized
bed of hot coke particles that are maintained at 20–40 psi and 500°C (932°F)
(Chapter 2) (Speight and Ozum, 2002). The feed vapors are cracked while352 coke

Coke for the aluminum industry is calcined to less than 0.5% volatiles
at 1300–1400°C (2372–2552°F) before it is used to make anodes.
Petroleum coke is used for a number of purposes, but its chief use is in
the manufacture of carbon electrodes for aluminum reﬁning, which requires
a high-purity carbon low in ash and sulfur free; the volatile matter must be
removed by calcining. In addition to its use as a metallurgical reducing
agent, petroleum coke is used in the manufacture of carbon brushes, silicon
carbide abrasives, and structural carbon (e.g., pipes and Rashig rings), as
well as calcium carbide manufacture, from which acetylene is produced:

CaC 2+H2O ÆHC∫CH
16.3. TEST METHODS
The test methods for coke are necessary for deﬁning the coke as a fuel (for
internal use in a reﬁnery) or for other uses, particularly those test methods
in which prior sale of the coke is involved. Speciﬁcations are often dictated
by environmental regulations, if not by the purchaser of the coke."
"The test methods outlined below are the methods that are usually
applied to petroleum coke but should not be thought of as the only test
methods. In fact, there are many test methods for coke (ASTM, 2000,
Volume 05.06) and these test methods should be consulted when either
more detail or a fuller review is required.
16.3.1. Ash
The ash content (that is, the ash yield, which is related to the mineral matter
content) is one of the properties used to evaluate coke; it indicates the
amount of undesirable residue present. Some samples of coke may be
declared to have an acceptable ash content, but this varies with the intended
use of the coke.
For the test method, the preparation and sampling of the analytical
sample must neither remove nor add mineral matter (ASTM D-346).
Improper dividing, sieving, and crushing equipment, and some mufﬂe
furnace lining material, can contaminate the coke and lead to erroneous
results. In addition, a high sulfur content of the furnace gases, regardless of
the source of the sulfur, can react with an alkaline ash to produce erratic
results. To counteract such an effect, the furnace should be swept with air.test methods 353In the test method (ASTM D-4422), a sample of petroleum coke is dried,
ground, and ashed in a mufﬂe furnace at 700–775°C (1292–1427°F). The
noncarbonaceous residue is weighed and reported as the percent by weight
ash. As already noted, the ash must not be understood to be the same as
the mineral content of the petroleum coke.
In addition, ashing procedures can be used as a preliminary step for
determination of the trace elements in coke and, by inference, in the higher-
boiling fractions of the crude oil. Among the techniques used for trace
element determinations are ﬂameless and ﬂame atomic absorption (AA)
spectrophotometry (ASTM D-2788, ASTM D-5863) and inductively
coupled argon plasma (ICP) spectrophotometry (ASTM D-5708).
Inductively coupled argon plasma emission spectrophotometry (ASTM
D-5708) has an advantage over atomic absorption spectrophotometry
(ASTM D-4628, ASTM D-5863) because it can provide more complete ele-
mental composition data than the atomic absorption method. Flame emis-
sion spectroscopy is often used successfully in conjunction with atomic
absorption spectrophotometry (ASTM D-3605). X-ray ﬂuorescence spec-
trophotometry (ASTM D-4927, ASTM D-6443) is also sometimes used, but
matrix effects can be a problem. The method to be used for the determi-
nation of metallic constituents is often a matter of individual preference.
16.3.2. Caloriﬁc Value (Heat of Combustion)
The caloriﬁc value (heat of combustion) is an important property, particu-
larly for the petroleum products that are used for burning, heating, or
similar usage. Knowledge of this value is essential when considering the
thermal efﬁciency of equipment for producing either power or heat. Heat
of combustion per unit of mass of coke is a critical property of coke
intended for use as a fuel.
In one test method that is suitable for coke (ASTM D-3523), the sample
is supported on surgical gauze and placed in a heated chamber that is open
to air at the top. The temperature of this sample is compared with that of
an equal reference quantity of surgical gauze contained in an identical
chamber. Tests may be conducted for durations of 4–72 h or longer.
Other methods using an adiabatic bomb calorimeter (ASTM D-2015,
ASTM D-5865) are also available.
When an experimental determination of heat of combustion is not avail-
able and cannot be made conveniently, an estimate might be considered sat-
isfactory (ASTM D-6446). In this test method the net heat of combustion
is calculated from the density and sulfur and hydrogen content, but this 
calculation is justiﬁable only when the fuel belongs to a well-deﬁned class
for which a relationship between these quantities has been derived from
accurate experimental measurements on representative samples. Thus the354 cokehydrogen content (ASTM D-5291), density (ASTM D-5004), and sulfur
content (ASTM D-1552, ASTM D-3177, ASTM D-4239) of the sample are
determined by experimental test methods, and the net heat of combustion
is calculated with the values obtained by these test methods based on
reported correlations.
16.3.3. Composition
The composition of petroleum coke varies with the source of the crude oil,
but in general, large amounts of high-molecular-weight complex hydrocar-
bons (rich in carbon but correspondingly poor in hydrogen) make up a high
proportion. The solubility of petroleum coke in carbon disulﬁde has been
reported to be as high as 50–80%, but this is in fact a misnomer, because
the coke is the insoluble honeycomb material that is the end product of
thermal processes.
Carbon and hydrogen in coke can be determined by the standard 
analytical procedures for coal and coke (ASTM D-3178, ASTM D-3179).
However, in addition to carbon, hydrogen, and metallic constituents, coke
also contains considerable amounts of nitrogen and sulfur that must be"
"determined before sale or use. These elements will appear as their respec-
tive oxides (NO x,S O x) when the coke is combusted, thereby causing serious
environmental issues.
A test method (ASTM D-5291) is available for simultaneous determi-
nation of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in petroleum products and lubri-
cants. There are at least three instrumental techniques available for this
analysis, each based on different chemical principles. However, all involve
sample combustion, components separation, and ﬁnal detection.
In one of the variants of the method, a sample is combusted in an oxygen
atmosphere and the product gases are separated from each other by adsorp-
tion over chemical agents. The remaining elemental nitrogen gas is meas-
ured by a thermal conductivity cell. Carbon and hydrogen are separately
measured by selective infrared cells as carbon dioxide and water. In another
variant of the method, a sample is combusted in an oxygen atmosphere, the
product gases are separated from each other, and the three gases of inter-
est are measured by gas chromatography. In the third variant of the method,
a sample is combusted in an oxygen atmosphere, the product gases are
cleaned by passage over chemical agents, and the three gases of interest are
chromatographically separated and measured with a thermal conductivity
detector.
The nitrogen method is not applicable too samples containing <0.75%
by weight nitrogen or for the analysis of volatile materials such as gasoline,
gasoline oxygenate blends, or aviation turbine fuels. The details of the
method should be consulted along with those given in an alternate methodtest methods 355for the determination of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in coal and coke
(ASTM D-3179, ASTM D-5373).
A test method (ASTM D-1552) is available for sulfur analysis; the
method covers three procedures applicable to samples boiling above 177°C
(350°F) and containing not less than 0.06 mass % sulfur. Thus the method
is applicable to most fuel oils, lubricating oils, residua, and coke, and coke
containing up to 8% by weight sulfur can be analyzed. This is particularly
important for cokes that originate from heavy oil and tar sand bitumen,
where the sulfur content of the coke is usually at least 5% by weight.
In the iodate detection system (ASTM D-1552), the sample is burned in
a stream of oxygen at a sufﬁciently high temperature to convert about 97%
by weight of the sulfur to sulfur dioxide. The combustion products are
passed into an absorber containing an acidic solution of potassium iodide
and starch indicator. A faint blue color is developed in the absorber solu-
tion by the addition of standard potassium iodate solution. As combustion
proceeds, bleaching the blue color, more iodate is added. The sulfur content
of the sample is calculated from the amount of standard iodate consumed
during the combustion.
In the infrared detection system, the sample is weighed into a special
ceramic boat that is then placed into a combustion furnace at 1371°C
(2500°F) in an oxygen atmosphere. Most of the sulfur present is converted
to sulfur dioxide that is then measured with an infrared detector after mois-
ture and dust are removed by traps. The calibration factor is determined
with standards approximating the material to be analyzed.
For the iodate method, chlorine in concentrations <1 mass % does not
interfere. The isoprene rubber method can tolerate somewhat higher levels.
Nitrogen when present at >0.1 mass % may interfere with the iodate
method, the extent of interference being dependent on the types of nitro-
gen compounds as well as the combustion conditions. It does not interfere
in the infrared method.The alkali and alkaline earth metals zinc, potassium,
and lead do not interfere with either method.
Determination of the physical composition can be achieved by any of
the test methods for determining the toluene-insoluble constituents of tar
and pitch (ASTM D-4072, ASTM D-4312). Furthermore, a variety of
samples can be used to give a gradation of soluble and insoluble fractions.
The coke, of course, remains in the extraction thimble (Soxhlet apparatus),
and the extracts are freed from the solvent and weighed to give percent by
weight yield(s).
Finally, one aspect that can pay a role in compositional studies is the sieve
(screening) analysis. As in all petroleum products, sampling is, or can be, a
major issue. If it is not performed correctly and poor sampling is the result,
erroneous and very misleading data can be produced by the analytical
method of choice. For this reason, reference is made to standard procedures356 cokesuch as the Standard Practice for Collection and Preparation of Coke
Samples for Laboratory Analysis (ASTM D-346) and the Standards Test
Method for the Sieve Analysis of Coke (ASTM D-293).
16.3.4. Density
The density (speciﬁc gravity ) of coke has a strong inﬂuence on its future use
and can affect the characteristics of products such as carbon and graphite."
"The density (speciﬁc gravity) of coke can be conveniently measured by
use of a pycnometer. In the test method (ASTM D-5004), the mass of the
sample is determined directly and the volume is derived by determining the
mass of liquid displaced when the sample is introduced into a pycnometer.
Oil or other material sprayed on calcined petroleum coke to control dust
will interfere. Such oil can be removed by ﬂushing with a solvent, which also
must be completely removed before the density determination.
The real density of coke is obtained when the particle size of the speci-
men is smaller than 75 mm. The real density (or the particle size) exerts a
direct inﬂuence on the physical and chemical properties of the carbon and
graphite products that are manufactured from the coke.
In the test method (ASTM D-2638), a sample is dried and ground to pass
through a 75-mm screen. The mass of the volume is determined directly,
and the volume is derived by the volume of helium displaced when the
sample is introduced into a helium pycnometer.The ratio of the mass of the
sample to the volume is reported as the real density.
The vibrated bulk density (VBD) is an indication of the porosity of cal-
cined petroleum coke, which affects its suitability for use in pitch-bonded
carbon applications. This property is strongly dependent on average par-
ticle size and range and tends to increase with decreasing coke size. In the
test method (ASTM D-4292), the coke is crushed, 100 g is measured after
vibration, and the bulk density is calculated. The procedure is limited 
to particles passing through a 6.68-mm opening sieve and retained on a
0.21-mm opening sieve.
16.3.5. Dust Control Material
Dust control material is applied to calcined coke to help maintain a dust-
free environment. It adds weight to the coke and can have a negative effect
on the quality of carbon and graphite artifacts made from the treated coke.
Hence, a maximum amount may be speciﬁed.
In the test method (ASTM D-4930), a weighed dry representative sample
of 6.3-mm maximum-sized coke is extracted with methylene chloride in a
Soxhlet apparatus. The mass of the residue remaining after extraction and
evaporation of the solvent is the mass of the dust control material. This testtest methods 357method is limited to those materials that are soluble in a solvent (for
example, methylene chloride) that can be used in a Soxhlet extraction type
of apparatus. Toluene and methyl chloroform have also been found to give
results equal to those of methylene chloride.
16.3.6. Hardness
The Hardgrove grindability index (HGI) (ASTM D-5003) is used to
predict the ranking in industrial size mills used for crushing operations and
is commonly used to determine the hardness of coal samples (ASTM 
D-409) (Speight, 1994). The rankings are based on energy required, feed
rate, or both. With the introduction of petroleum coke in the coal market,
this test method has been extended to the coke.. In the current context,
the Hardgrove grindability index is also used to select raw petroleum 
coke and coals that are compatible with each other when milled together
in a blend so that segregation of the blend does not occur during particle
size reduction.
In the test method (ASTM D-5003), the coke sample is crushed to
produce a high yield of particles passing a No. 16 sieve and retained on a
No. 30 sieve. These particles are reduced in the Hardgrove grindability
machine according to the test method for coal (ASTM D-409). The quan-
tity of particles retained on a No. 200 sieve is used to calculate the Hard-
grove grindability index of the sample. Both this test method and the test
method for coal (ASTM D-409) produce the same results on petroleum
coke samples.
16.3.7. Metals
The presence and concentration of various metallic elements in petroleum
coke are major factors in the suitability of the coke for various uses.
In the test method (ASTM D-5056), a sample of petroleum coke is ashed
(thermally decomposed to leave only the ash of the inorganic constituents)
at 525°C (977°F). The ash is fused with lithium tetraborate or lithium
metaborate. The melt is then dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid, and the
resultant solution is analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy to deter-
mine the metals in the sample. However, spectral interferences may occur
when using wavelengths other than those recommended for analysis or
when using multielement hollow cathode lamps.
This test method can be used in the commercial transfer of petroleum
coke to determine whether a lot of coke meets the speciﬁcations. This
method can analyze raw and calcined coke for the trace elements alu-
minum, calcium, iron, nickel, silicon, sodium, and vanadium.The inductively
coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICPAES) method (ASTM358 cokeD-5600; ASTM D-6357) is complementary to this method and can also be
used for determination of metals in petroleum coke.
In the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy"
"(ICPAES) method (ASTM D-5600), a sample of petroleum coke is ashed
at 700°C (1292°F) and the ash is fused with lithium borate. The melt is dis-
solved in dilute hydrochloric acid, and the resultant solution is analyzed by
inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy with aqueous 
calibration standards. Because of the need to fuse the ash with lithium
borate or other suitable salt, the fusibility of ash may need attention 
(ASTM D-1857).
The wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy method (ASTM D-6376)
provides a rapid means of measuring metallic elements in coke and 
provides a guide for determining conformance to material speciﬁcations.
A beneﬁt of this method is that the sulfur content can also be used to 
evaluate potential formation of sulfur oxides, a source of atmospheric pol-
lution. This test method speciﬁcally determines sodium, aluminum, silicon,
sulfur, calcium, titanium, vanadium, manganese, iron, and nickel.
In this method, a weighed portion of a sample of coke is dried at 110°C
(230°F)and crushed to pass a 200-mesh sieve, mixed with stearic acid, and
then milled and compressed into a smooth pellet. The pellet is irradiated
with an X ray beam, and the characteristic X rays of the elements analyzed
are excited, separated, and detected by the spectrometer. The measured X
ray intensities are converted to elemental concentration by using a cali-
bration equation derived from the analysis of the standard materials. The
Kaspectral lines are used for all of the elements determined by this test
method. This test method is also applicable to the determination of addi-
tional elements provided that appropriate standards are available for use
and comparison.
16.3.8. Proximate Analysis
In contrast to the elemental analysis, the proximate analysis of coke is the
determination of the amount of mineral ash (ASTM D-3174), volatile
matter (ASTM D-3175), water (moisture) (ASTM D-3173), and ﬁxed
carbon. The ﬁxed carbon is a calculated value and is the result of the sum-
mation of mineral ash (% by weight), volatile matter (% by weight), and
water (% by weight) subtracted from 100.
The ﬁxed carbon has been suggested to be analogous to the carbon
residue (ASTM D-189, ASTM D-524, ASTM D-4530, IP 13, IP 14I, IP 398),
but caution is advised against the literal use of such a comparison. The tests
do not have a similar technical basis, and the calculation of ﬁxed carbon by
summation and subtraction means that the ultimate answer is subject to the
errors of each measurement.test methods 359As an enhancement or extension of the method for proximate analysis,
the determination of the physical composition can be achieved by any of
the test methods for determining the toluene-insoluble constituents of tar
and pitch (ASTM D-4072, ASTM D-4312). Furthermore, a variety of
samples can be used to give a gradation of soluble and insoluble fractions.
The coke, of course, remains in the extraction thimble (Soxhlet apparatus),
and the extracts are freed from the solvent and weighed to give percent by
weight yield(s).
16.3.9. Sulfur
In addition to metallic constituents, coke also contains considerable
amounts of sulfur (ASTM D-1552, ASTM D-3177, ASTM D-4239) that
must be determined before sale or use.
A test method (ASTM D-1552) is available for sulfur analysis that covers
three procedures applicable to samples boiling above 177°C (350°F) and
containing not less than 0.06 mass % sulfur. Thus the method is applicable
to most fuel oils, lubricating oils, residua, and coke, and coke containing up
to 8% by weight sulfur can be analyzed. This is particularly important for
cokes that originate from heavy oil and tar sand bitumen, in which the sulfur
content of the coke is usually at least 5% by weight.
In the iodate detection system (ASTM D-1552), the sample is burned in
a stream of oxygen at a sufﬁciently high temperature to convert about 97%
by weight of the sulfur to sulfur dioxide. The combustion products are
passed into an absorber containing an acidic solution of potassium iodide
and starch indicator. A faint blue color is developed in the absorber solu-
tion by the addition of standard potassium iodate solution. As combustion
proceeds, bleaching the blue color, more iodate is added. The sulfur content
of the sample is calculated from the amount of standard iodate consumed
during the combustion.
In the infrared detection system, the sample is weighed into a special
ceramic boat that is then placed into a combustion furnace at 1371°C
(2500°F) in an oxygen atmosphere. Most of the sulfur present is converted
to sulfur dioxide that is then measured with an infrared detector after mois-
ture and dust are removed by traps. The calibration factor is determined
with standards approximating the material to be analyzed.
For the iodate method, chlorine in concentrations <1 mass % does not
interfere. The isoprene rubber method can tolerate somewhat higher levels.
Nitrogen when present at >0.1 mass % may interfere with the iodate"
"method; the extent of interference being dependent on the types of nitro-
gen compounds as well as the combustion conditions. It does not interfere
in the infrared method. The alkali and alkaline earth metals, zinc, potas-
sium, and lead do not interfere with either method.360 coke16.3.10. Volatile Matter
The volatile matter in coke affects the density of coke particles and can
affect artifacts produced from further processing of the coke. The volatile
matter can be used in estimating the caloriﬁc value of coke.
This test method (ASTM D-6374) covers the determination of the
volatile matter produced by pyrolysis or evolved when petroleum coke is
subjected to the speciﬁc conditions of the test method.
In the test method, the volatile matter of a moisture-free petroleum coke
sample is determined by measuring the mass loss of the coke when heated
under the exact conditions of the test method (ASTM D-6374).
There are two sources of interferences in this test method—moisture and
particle size. Moisture increases the mass loss, the moisture-free sample
weight is decreased by the amount of moisture actually present in the test
sample, and the particle size range of the analysis sample affects the volatile
matter. The coarser the sample, the lower the reported yield of volatile
matter. The method is not satisfactory for determining the content of dust
control material , and samples with a thermal history above 600°C (1112°F)
are excluded from this test.
In another test method (ASTM D-4421), volatile matter of a moisture-
free petroleum coke is determined by measuring the mass loss of the
coke when heated under the exact conditions of this procedure. Again,
the particle size range of the sample affects the volatile matter insofar as
coarser samples give rise to a lower yield of volatile matter. Samples with
a thermal history above 600°C (1112°F) are excluded from the test, and
the method is not satisfactory for determining the content of dust control
material.
16.3.11. Water
Water (or moisture) in coke adds weight to coke, and knowledge of the
water in the coke is important in the purchase and sale of green coke.
The test method (ASTM D-4931) presents two procedures. The prepa-
ration procedure is used when the petroleum coke sample contains free
water. The sample is weighed and air dried to equilibrate it with the atmos-
phere. Determination of the residual moisture is then determined with the
drying oven method. Air drying and residual moisture are combined to
report gross moisture. The drying oven method is used in routine commer-
cial practice when the sample does not contain free water. The sample is
crushed to at least 25-mm (1 in.) top sieve size and divided into individual
aliquots of at least 500 g. This test method covers both the preparation pro-
cedure for samples containing free water and the determination of the gross
moisture content of green petroleum coke.test methods 361REFERENCES
